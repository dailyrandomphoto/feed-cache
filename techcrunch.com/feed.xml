										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google’s latest investment in India is a startup that is helping businesses come online.</p>
<p>One-year-old <a href="https://dotpe.in">DotPe</a>, a Gurgaon-based startup, said on Friday it has raised $27.5 million in its Series A financing round. The round was led by PayU, with participation from existing investor Info Edge Ventures and Google.</p>
<p>The young startup, now valued at about $90 million, helps brick and mortar stores sell to customers online and collect payments digitally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a problem that scores of startups in India are solving today, but DotPe has some additional hooks. It helps merchants scan their inventories and quickly establish a log online.</p>
<p>Once the catalog is ready, a business can then make it available on WhatsApp and reach customers there. WhatsApp is the most popular smartphone app in India with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">over 450 million users</a>. DotPe says it also helps businesses get visibility on Google Search.</p>
<p>The startup, co-founded by Shailaz Nag, formerly co-founder and managing director of PayU, also enables neighborhood stores to collect payments from walk-in customers and features tools to offer loyalty points and discounts to customers to boost engagement.</p>
<p>“This new partnership will empower businesses to be more discoverable, expand business avenues and conduct commerce like never before,” said Nag. “Pandemic or not, we are here to reimagine the way offline businesses work and bring the digital revolution to the doorstep of every entrepreneur.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2130613" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dotpe.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="343" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dotpe.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dotpe.jpg?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dotpe.jpg?resize=300,101 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dotpe.jpg?resize=768,257 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dotpe.jpg?resize=680,228 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dotpe.jpg?resize=1536,515 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dotpe.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>DotPe says its platform, which doesn’t require businesses to install an app, has amassed over 5 million merchants in the last six months. These merchants are seeing over 38% of daily orders from repeat customers, the startup said.</p>
<p>“In a very short time, DotPe has acquired a promising merchant base with its impeccable product experience and innovation,” said Anirban Mukherjee, CEO, PayU India.</p>
<p>Sanjay Gupta, VP and Country Head of Google India, said in a statement that the company’s investment in DotPe is illustrative of Google’s belief in “working with India’s start-up ecosystem towards the goal of building a more inclusive digital economy that will benefit everyone.”</p>
<p>Google announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">$10 billion fund</a> for India last year, its biggest market by users. The Android-maker has invested in several startups in the country including hyperlocal delivery firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/google-backs-indias-dunzo-in-40-million-funding-round/">Dunzo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">InMobi Group&#8217;s Glance, and DailyHunt</a>.</p>
<p>DotPe said it will deploy the fresh capital to reach more merchants in India and scale its technology stack to meet the growing demand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you browse Instagram, you are probably familiar with the term &#8220;link in bio.&#8221; Links aren’t allowed in post captions, and users are only allowed one URL in their bios, so many create a simple website with multiple links for their followers. <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree</a>, one of the most popular &#8220;link in bio&#8221; services with more than 12 million users, announced today it has raised $45 million in Series B funding. The round was co-led by Index Ventures and Coatue, with participation from returning investors AirTree Ventures and Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Coatue chairman Dan Rose will join Linktree’s board of directors. The Sydney, Australia-based startup’s last round was a $10.7 million Series A announced in October 2020. Linktree’s latest funding will be used on tools that make social commerce easier.</p>

<p>Linktree says about a third, or 4 million, of its users signed up within the last three months. This is in partly because people have been spending more time on social media and e-commerce shopping during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Linktree now competes with a roster of &#8220;link in bio&#8221; services, including Shorby, Linkin.bio and the recently launched Beacons.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we launched Linktree, we created an entirely new category. We were first to market and, with over 12 million users globally, still hold 88% of market share,&#8221; founder and chief executive officer Alex Zaccaria told TechCrunch. &#8220;Inevitably we’ve seen plenty of competitors pop up as a result, but part of the uniqueness of Linktree is its deceptively simple design.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zaccaria added that one of Linktree&#8217;s differentiators is its adoption by users in a wide range of categories, including health and wellness, real estate, sports, music, politics, publishing and food. It&#8217;s used for bio links by Shopify, Facebook, TikTok, YSL, HBO and Major League Baseball, and celebrities like Jonathan Van Ness, Jamie Oliver and Pharrell.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might have started as a link-in-bio tool, but over time Linktree has evolved and the platform has become a social identity layer of the internet. Our vision for how the platform will sit at the intersection of digital self-expression and action means we’re thinking boldly when it comes to our roadmap.&#8221;</p>

<p>The home ownership rate in Vietnam is <a href="https://vneconomictimes.com/article/property/millennials-finding-home-ownership-difficult"> about 90%</a>, but many millennials are struggling to join that number. Rising property prices in cities, coupled with a lack of financing options, mean more people <a href="https://vneconomictimes.com/article/property/millennials-finding-home-ownership-difficult">have to delay buying their first homes</a> unless they have family support.</p>
<p>Part of Y Combinator’s latest batch,<a href="https://homebase.com.vn/"> Homebase</a> was founded in 2019 to give prospective buyers in Vietnam an alternative to traditional financing. Homebase acts as a co-investor, buying a share of property with customers, who then have the option of purchasing equity from Homebase until they take full ownership, or selling the property for their portion of the proceeds. In the meantime, buyers pay rent to Homebase that corresponds to the company’s stake, and have full usage rights to the home, so they can live in or rent it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Co-founders Junyuan Tan and Phillip An originally started Homebase in Singapore, but decided to focus on Vietnam because Tan had lived there while working on his previous startups, RePrice Technologies and Atlantis Lab. Tan wanted to buy a home, but found bank mortgages charged high interest rates even on short-term loans.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the whole of Southeast Asia, compared to Europe or the U.S., there are really no other solutions, like government schemes or rent-to-own financing solutions,&#8221; Homebase chief operating officer Phillip An told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Its model is similar to Divvy Homes and ZeroDown in the United States and, in fact, leaders from both startups have invested in Homebase (Divvy Homes co-founder Brian Ma and ZeroDown’s former COO Troy Steckenrider). Homebase’s <a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/singapore-vc-firm-1982-ventures-invests-in-vietnams-homebase">other backers</a> include VinaCapital Ventures, Class 5 Global, Pegasus Technology Ventures, 1982 Ventures, Antler and Darius Cheung, the founder and CEO of 99.co.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Divvy Homes secures $110M Series C to help renters become homeowners&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/divvy-homes-secures-110m-series-c-to-help-renters-become-homeowners/embed/#?secret=h9RIJmJYD3" data-secret="h9RIJmJYD3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Most of Homebase’s transactions are currently in Ho Chi Minh City and Saigon, and it plans to expand into Hanoi and Danang by the end of this year. Ultimately, Homebase’s goal is to enter other Southeast Asian markets where home owners also face a dearth of financing options, like Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, <a href="ttps://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/country/vietnam">about 70% of adults are “unbanked,”</a> meaning they don’t have a bank account, which makes it difficult to apply for mortgages. An said some of Homebase’s customers use the service because they are unbanked. Other customers have financial accounts, but see Homebase as a faster, more flexible option to bank loans.</p>
<p>Its contracts range from one to 10 years, and at the end, customers have the option of buying all the equity in the property or selling it with Homebase to get back their investment. The amount of equity customers buy at the start also varies. For example, home buyers who are using Homebase as an alternative to mortgages typically take an initial 20% to 30% stake in the property, while real estate investors often start with a 50% stake.</p>
<p>Homebase finances its stake in properties in part by working with third-party financial institutions, including private high-net worth individuals and family offices who see it as an opportunity to diversify their holdings into a new asset class. An said the company is also talking to different types of funds, including equity, hedge, real estate debt and emerging market debt, from Europe, the United States and Singapore.</p>
<p>To screen applicants, Homebase has an internal checklist and onboarding process, and it also works with real estate agents, developers and other partners in Vietnam.</p>
<p>For those third parties, Homebase serves as a value-add tool that helps them close more deals by providing a way for customers to get financing. Homebase also performs due diligence on potential properties, including examining documentation and permits, and has built an asset valuation model based on existing property data, transaction data and information from developers.</p>
<p>An said this valuation service, which Homebase is expanding, is a key part of the business because it provides assurance to buyers that the company’s incentives are aligned with theirs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stand to risk our investment, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many customers are also first-time buyers and they want more help to find a good property.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic’s impact on the business world encouraged adtech startups and digital marketing agencies to collaborate more, helping brands survive the pandemic by bringing businesses closer to consumers.</p>
<p>Although overall spending on advertising slowed in 2020, it is expected to recover in 2021 and reach $630 billion in 2024. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/990/global-advertising-market/">Statista</a>, North America spends the most on advertising, with second place going to Asia and Western Europe. The rest of Europe, Africa and the Middle East lag behind.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, the Middle East embodies great potential. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/990/global-advertising-market/">Statista</a>, it boasts the highest growth, with a 600% increase in digital advertising in the MENA region between 2010 and 2015. Although consumers in the region used to prefer traditional advertising channels, the internet took over in 2020, with 44.2% of the total ad expenditures, while TV dropped to 30%.</p>
<p>Here are several essential characteristics of digital advertising in the Middle East region:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/time-for-consumer-centred-metrics.html">PwC report</a>, 39% of shoppers in the Middle East use social media to find inspiration for purchases, compared to the global average of 29%.</li>
<li>Due to the existence of a shadow economy, political regulations and unofficial business, the amount of digital ad spending in the MENA region ranged from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/799847/mena-internet-advertising-spending/">$1 billion</a> to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ae/mena-advertising-expenditure-dissected">$1.2 billion</a> in 2020.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-advertising/saudi-arabia">Paid social</a> is the leading category in digital advertising expenditures in the MENA region. Saudi Arabia and Egypt are the largest in terms of active YouTube users.</li>
<li>There are more than 500 digital agencies listed in the region. UAE is leading in terms of big advertising agencies, while Egypt and Saudi Arabia are famous for small- and medium-size agencies. Most digital marketing talent and creative resources reside in Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan, while most adtech startups are born in Israel, UAE and Qatar, according to digital marketing consultant <a href="https://consultyasser.com/stats-digital-advertising-in-the-mena/">Yasser Ahmad</a>.</li>
<li>E-commerce is driving growth, hitting $17 billion in the Middle East in 2020, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1147942/mena-value-of-e-commerce-market-by-country/">Statista</a>, with many online shoppers increasing the frequency of purchases during the pandemic.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bbgventures.com/">BBG Ventures</a>, an eight-year-old, New York-based seed- and early-stage venture firm that only backs founding teams which feature at least one woman, just locked down $50 million in capital for its third fund, a major leap over its first two funds, both sized at $10 million.</p>
<p>One determining factor in the bigger fund is that BBGV, formerly backed exclusively by AOL (now Verizon Media), now has a broader pool of institutional and individual investors, including the State of Michigan Retirement Systems, the George Kaiser Family Foundation and Verizon Ventures, along with Poshmark cofounder Tracy Sun, ClassPass cofounder Payal Kadakia, and venture capitalists Aileen Lee, Theresia Gouw, and Jennifer Fonstad.</p>
<p>The young firm also has a track record to which to point. Though an investment in the coworking space The Wing may have taken an <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/what-happened-to-the-wing.html">unexpected turn</a>, hurt by a national lockdown and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/style/the-wing-ceo-audrey-gelman-resigns.html">internal turmoil</a>, other bets have been growing, including the e-commerce platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/zola-the-650m-wedding-portal-taps-the-travel-market-with-an-expansion-into-honeymoons/">Zola</a>; the feminine hygiene brand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/12/lola-just-raised-24m-for-a-subscription-service-that-ships-tampons-pads-and-now-condoms/">Lola</a>; and <a href="https://www.springhealth.com/">Spring Health</a>, a mental health benefits platform for employers that recently closed on <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/spring-health-scores-76m-investment-as-demand-for-virtual-mental-health-soars">$76 million</a> in Series B funding led by Tiger Global Management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s saying nothing of the vast and underserved opportunity to invest in women-led teams that BBGV&#8217;s founders, Susan Lyne and Nisha Dua, believe most venture firms still don&#8217;t fully appreciate.</p>
<p>We talked earlier today about why that is with Lyne, who is a former ABC president, former Martha Stewart Living CEO and former CEO of AOL Brand Group; and Dua, who is a former lawyer, management consultant, chief of staff to Lyne, and founder. Our conversation has been edited for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC You&#8217;ve raised $50 million. What size checks will you be writing? Are you looking to take bigger positions or do you have a more diverse approach?</strong></p>
<p>ND: We&#8217;re looking at writing $500,000 to $1 million checks. We look for 7.5% to 10% ownership, and we&#8217;re open to co-leading, but we prefer to lead. We&#8217;ve been leading rounds already with this with this fund. We&#8217;ll likely do about 30 companies from the fund, backing a mix of pre-seed and seed-stage startups, with reserves for follow-on funding.</p>
<p>SL: We&#8217;ve actually done 11 investments; we started investing after the first close.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve invested in nearly 80 startups over the years. What has been your biggest investment to date?</strong></p>
<p>ND: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/with-another-2-5-million-in-funding-julia-collins-planet-fwd-launches-climate-friendly-snack-brand/">Planet Forward</a>, which was founded by Zume cofounder Julia Collins.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Have you &#8212; or would you &#8212; ever form a special purpose vehicle to invest more in a startup than your fund enables?</strong></p>
<p>SL: We didn&#8217;t do it for our last funds, but we did our first SPV for this fund, in a company called <a href="https://starface.world/">Starface</a>, which is skincare company that takes a very different approach to the acne problem. You&#8217;ve probably seen the gold stars [that its customers apply to their pimples] on social media. They&#8217;ve been growing very fast and did a Series A recently and we took part of it ourselves but we also opened an SPV for one of our LPs.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What themes interest you right now?</strong></p>
<p>SL: We&#8217;ve done a lot of investing thus far in health and well being. That&#8217;s our largest category. The second is the future of work and education; the third is climate-friendly commerce; and the fourth is really underestimated, or emerging consumers. In all of those areas, we have actually found there are many, many, many female founders who are active and building great companies</p>
<p>ND: Also, we [have historically] described ourselves as a consumer fund, but we are doing more B2B in this fund, where we think that the B2B approach could solve a bigger consumer problem, including for many millions of consumers.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s an example of what you mean?</strong></p>
<p>SL: <a href="https://www.withgrayce.com/">Grayce</a>, which is doing eldercare and actually selling to employers as an employee benefit. If you look at the cost to companies because of the number of hours and days that many people invest in taking care of an aging parent or trying to figure out what the next step is for them [you appreciate the need for this kind of service]. This platform not only allows you to connect with someone who can help you plan but also points you to the resources you need, including financial resources, legal resources, and living resources.</p>
<p>ND: Another is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/15/full-harvest-series-a/">Full Harvest</a>, a marketplace and logistics platform that takes all the excess food on a farm that doesn&#8217;t meet cosmetic standards and resells it to juice and salad makers and other food brands and manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mentioned Julia Collins. Do you know how many first-time founders you&#8217;ve backed versus repeat entrepreneurs?</strong></p>
<p>ND: There&#8217;s a mix. We don&#8217;t have a preference.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have a geographic focus?</strong></p>
<p>SL: I would say, New York City is definitely our primary source for for companies for a lot of reasons, including that there&#8217;s a very rich and active female founder community here. This is the headquarters for many different kinds of industries, so you get a range of talent here. But we&#8217;ve also invested in San Francisco companies, companies in Los Angeles, in Milwaukee, in San Diego. [We see] opportunity in at least a dozen cities across the country.</p>
<p><strong>TC Have have your syndicate partners changed over time, if at all?</strong></p>
<p>ND: That&#8217;s been one of the most exciting things of the past few years. We love to partner with women GPs &#8212; folks like Kara Norton of Upfront Ventures and Jess Lee of Sequoia. There is a great spiderweb of women GPs emerging at these top venture funds who can create these strong relationships and are ultimately leads for follow-on rounds.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do think women-led teams are receiving the valuations they would if they were all-male teams? I was horrified to read earlier today that the wage gap between men and women has improved by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/us/equal-pay-day-explainer.html">8 cents</a> over the last 25 years. </strong></p>
<p>SL: I can&#8217;t speak authoritatively about whether women are getting lower valuations across the board. We certainly know that they are getting a vastly lower percentage of the venture capital investment. If you <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/">look at the stats</a> about the amount of funding for women in 2020 versus men, it&#8217;s definitely disturbing and shows the vast majority of venture capital is still going to all all male teams. I think some of that is due to the megarounds that we&#8217;ve seen, but not enough of it to make a significant difference.</p>
<p>ND: I think it was Harvard Business Review that did some really <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/06/male-and-female-entrepreneurs-get-asked-different-questions-by-vcs-and-it-affects-how-much-funding-they-get">interesting research</a> at a [2017] TechCrunch Disrupt event that overwhelmingly suggested that men are judged on their potential and women are often judged on their current expertise, and we [might] surmise that [these factors] could have something to do with valuations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why we&#8217;re leading rounds. We see the opportunities that these female-led teams are going after &#8212; and we have the opportunity to assess them on their exact merits.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Zuckerberg defends Facebook over role in Capitol attack</strong></p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter&#8217;s Jack Dorsey and Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai appeared at a hearing today with the House Energy and Commerce Committee on the theme of misinformation, particularly the role that their platforms may have played in the Capitol attack by allowing lies and extremism to spread.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In his opening statement, Zuckerberg advocated for reforms to Section 230 and said that Facebook &#8220;did our part&#8221; to protect last year&#8217;s presidential election, putting the blame for the Capitol riots squarely on former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Pressed by Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA) on whether Facebook bears some responsibility,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/facebook-capitol-riot-zuckerberg-sandberg-comments-hearing/"> Zuckerberg replied</a>, &#8220;I think the responsibility lies with the people who took the actions to break the law and do the insurrection. Secondarily, also with the people who spread that content, including the president but others as well, with repeated rhetoric over time, saying that the election was rigged and encouraging people to organize, I think that those people bear the primary responsibility as well.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If Congress wants to write laws that effectively regulate companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, it needs to change the ways it interacts with those companies, because these hearings ain&#8217;t it. They&#8217;re a waste of everyone&#8217;s time, and no one is even pretending otherwise. To truly put Big Tech on the spot, future hearings need to do — at the very least — these three things.</p>
<h2>Change the format</h2>
<p>Five minutes of free-form questioning by 60 or 70 representatives sequentially is the current format for House hearings, and it&#8217;s a disaster — especially on Zoom or Bluejeans or whatever Congress uses.</p>
<p>Over and over again we get representatives who spend three-fourths of their time on de facto opening statements that are as likely as not to be pandering bloviations redundant with what&#8217;s already been said. Once that&#8217;s finished, the short remaining time forces them to require yes or no answers to poorly posed questions about complex topics.</p>

Have done for years, yet representatives still complain about it, even when their questions can&#8217;t conceivably be answered with a yes or no without over-committing or self-incrimination.</p>
<p>When you ask, and this was an actual question, &#8220;Do you think the law should allow you to be the arbiters of truth, as they have under section 230?&#8221; — you cannot seriously expect a yes or no answer. It&#8217;s the tech equivalent of &#8220;Have you stopped beating your dog?&#8221;</p>
<p>Faced with pointless or impossible questions, Zuckerberg maintained a sort of perpetually aggrieved countenance, looking more like the dog than the beater. Pichai tuned out, missing questions or offering obvious platitudes when called on. Dorsey, plainly bored, <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375152199433527296">tweeted</a> his way through the hearing and answered in monosyllables even when it was not required of him.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jack-q.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2130515" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jack-q.png" alt="" width="766" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jack-q.png 766w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jack-q.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jack-q.png?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jack-q.png?resize=680,296 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jack-q.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /></a>As irritating as this political theater is to watch, it must surely be more so to take part in. Seeing that nothing worthwhile can be said or done in these five-minute abuse sessions, the highly visible chief goal of the CEOs is to run out the clock — safe and incredibly easy to do. Sometimes they appeared to be barely paying attention, secure in the knowledge that they can respond &#8220;these are nuanced issues&#8230; we take this very seriously, Congresswo—&#8221; before being cut off. Begging off based on being &#8220;unsure about the exact details&#8221; and saying you&#8217;ll follow up is another zero-commitment option.</p>
<p>The format needs to be changed to allow for substantive discussion, firstly by extending each member&#8217;s questioning time limit to eight or 10 minutes at least; secondly, by providing some kind of guideline for answering, for instance guaranteeing 10 seconds but silencing them after 30. So much is lost to crosstalk in these video hearings that ultimately it&#8217;s better to allow a bad answer to go for 20 seconds than to object to it for 25.</p>
<p>It may also pay to limit the participants, allowing the leaders of the Committee to allocate time as they see fit to a smaller number of representatives who have more than boilerplate outrage to put on the record. How exactly this could be accomplished is probably subject to a raft of rules and procedural things, but seriously, there&#8217;s no point in having most of these people involved. Keep it fair, keep it bipartisan and let each party either exclude its cranks or own them.</p>
<p>Real consequences or legally extracted promises need to exist as well. Representative Bobby Rush (D-IL) brought up an independent audit Jack Dorsey promised — on the record, to Congress — in 2018. It never took place, with Dorsey saying they decided to do something else instead. So it wasn&#8217;t a promise, it wasn&#8217;t a requirement and there was no legal compulsion to do anything at all. Why even bother asking if all you&#8217;re doing is asking for a favor? Lawmakers need bite to back up their bark, and if that doesn&#8217;t exist, they should refrain from barking so much.</p>
<h2>Have a real agenda</h2>
<p>If the format changes, the agenda needs to as well. Because if we simply allow these clueless lawmakers more time to read their scripts, the scripts will, like legislative goldfish, expand to fill the time allotted to them.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen hearings that have made a difference, usually because the people involved have evidence to present and arguments to accompany it. Vice President Kamala Harris was great at this, having a background as a prosecutor — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/sen-harris-puts-zuckerberg-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place-for-not-disclosing-data-misuse/">she made it pretty hot for Zuckerberg back in 2018</a>. Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and David Cicilline (D-RI) made Jeff Bezos look like he was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/bezos-cant-guarantee-no-anti-competitive-activity-as-congress-catches-him-flat-footed/">either ignorant or had something to hide</a> last year by confronting him with incriminating testimony and requiring a real answer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t trust our legislators to be informed (or truthful) on these issues or really to even care. Most of the time their questions come off like something anyone could throw together an hour before the hearing with some quick background searches. Some of it (like hammering on the long-settled NY Post/Hunter Biden debacle) is so out of date that it proves beyond a doubt that the questioner had no intention of addressing the issues ostensibly at hand. Why let them waste everyone&#8217;s time on irrelevant topics?</p>
<p>Subpoena power comes with its own problems — no one wants to fight a court battle every time they want to ask a few questions — but if Congress is not going to use the tools available to it in the pursuit of legislating these issues, what exactly do they bring to the table?</p>
<p>If hearings don&#8217;t have a driving force behind them, such as an event, investigation or document release, they are almost by definition just a way for representatives to generate sound bites and appear concerned to their constituency. Today&#8217;s event is very much an example of this.</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Jack Dorsey are very smart. Very well-informed. Very important. But their roles as figureheads as well as decisionmakers in their companies and industries makes it nearly impossible for them to say anything that hasn&#8217;t been drafted and cleared ahead of time, and they are also free to not remember or defer to an absent colleague.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no blood to squeeze from these stones, so invite someone else. This was a hearing about disinformation — these companies have people making everyday decisions and directly overseeing projects on that topic. <em>They</em> should be the ones being asked to answer Congress&#8217;s questions.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s conceivable, if almost certainly untrue, that Zuckerberg &#8220;doesn&#8217;t recall&#8221; conversations about hiding abuse of Facebook data from users. Getting him to take that position is a victory of a sort, but it would be better to have the person whose responsibility this actually was, someone who can&#8217;t take refuge in hysterical ignorance.</p>
<p>Certainly these VPs and heads of what have you would also be media trained and prepped with canned statements, but it&#8217;s better than the alternative. These CEOs are Teflon-coated and this isn&#8217;t their first time in front of the shouting squad. They no longer care about anything but keeping the hearings as boring as possible and avoiding a news cycle. (Dorsey&#8217;s weird clock was a great blow-off valve for this. Pichai&#8217;s aggressively ordinary background gave you nothing to focus on but his answers — wrong play. And Zuckerberg&#8217;s high-quality camera setup only made him look more damp and robotic.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Every time one of these hearings takes place, the overwhelming impression one gets from them is of a lost opportunity. Here are elected lawmakers given a chance to speak directly to some of the most powerful people in the tech industry, and perhaps nine out of 10 use that time to retread old topics, thrust dubious information into the record, or simply relish their chance to push around someone like Mark Zuckerberg. The temptation is understandable but legislators must put the country first.</p>
<p>Though some representatives raised important issues today, the format prevented them from extracting substantive answers; the lack of a cohesive agenda or central documents meant they had no compelling evidence to put forth; the subjects of their questioning were bored and had no reason to say anything beyond what they put in their carefully prepared opening statements. If future hearings — concerning this or other industries — don&#8217;t change things up, no one should be surprised if they, like this one, yield nothing but hot air.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche has added its first all-electric vehicle, the Taycan sports sedan, to its subscription and short-term rental program as part of a broader expansion that aims to build a new customer base of U.S. owners.</p>
<p>The German automaker said Thursday it is also expanding the Porsche Drive subscription and rental programs to five more cities — up from four. It&#8217;s now offered to customers living in Atlanta, Houston and Phoenix, and in California in Irvine, Los Angeles, Monterey, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose. Porsche said it plans to continue its expansion in the United States throughout this year and into 2022.</p>
<p>Porsche&#8217;s programs are all about flexibility — and that comes with a price. The Taycan 4S model, which will initially only be available under the single-vehicle subscription or rental plans, cost about 20% more than the monthly cost of a comparable two-year lease. The Taycan 4S fee is $3,250 per month and the Taycan rear-wheel drive will be $2,500 monthly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Renting a Taycan 4S under the short-term plan costs $335 per day for one to three days and $295 a day for more than four days. All prices exclude taxes and fees and any subscriber has to pay a $595 activation fee. Porsche is adding the Taycan rear-wheel drive model later this spring.</p>
<p>Despite the eye-popping price of these programs, they have been popular enough to warrant an expansion. Porsche Drive is booked out one to two months ahead in most markets, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>The automaker views these programs as a complement to selling and leasing cars, not a replacement, according to Porsche Cars North America President and CEO Kjell Gruner. About 80% of Drive customers are new to Porsche, Gruner said.</p>
<p>Porsche first piloted a subscription program in 2017 and has been tinkering ever since. There are now three plans, or tiers, that are all housed under its Porsche Drive vehicle subscription program, which was rebranded in 2020. The most robust plan is Porsche Drive – Multi-Vehicle Subscription, which offers customers the ability to swap through a variety of vehicles on a monthly basis. Porsche Drive-single vehicle subscription gives access to one vehicle for one or three months with an option to extend. Then there’s Porsche Drive – Rental, which as the name indicates, offers shorter-term rentals that are targeted to those who want access to the brand&#8217;s luxury sports cars and SUVs for a week or just a weekend.</p>
<p>All of these plans are accessed by the Porsche Drive app. Users can pick their vehicle and schedule concierge service for vehicle delivery and pick-up through the app. The subscription plans are all based on a flat monthly fee that covers vehicle maintenance and insurance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey got called out by Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-NY) for tweeting during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">today&#8217;s congressional hearing on disinformation and extremism.</a> The tech exec&#8217;s tweet was likely expressing frustration with the format of the hearing, which once again saw the tech CEOs forced to boil down their answers to complicated questions into simple &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; answers &#8212; or otherwise be cut off from responding. Cryptically, Dorsey this afternoon <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1375152199433527296">tweeted</a> out a Twitter poll with just one question: &#8220;?&#8221; that had only two answers to choose from: either a &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>His post &#8212; or social commentary, if you will &#8212; did not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Before Rice moved into her line of questioning, which focused on platforms&#8217; ability to radicalize U.S. veterans&#8217; and military service members, she asked the Twitter CEO about his tweet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dorsey, what is winning &#8212; yes or no &#8212; on your Twitter account&#8230;poll?,&#8221; asked Rice, who sat in front of colorful wallpaper covered with flowers, butterflies, bugs and maybe snakes (??), which we agree was one of the better web conferencing backgrounds of the day &#8212; perhaps even besting Dorsey&#8217;s decision to Zoom from his kitchen with a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/heres-the-weird-clock-on-jack-dorseys-kitchen-counter-1846553535">cleverly placed blockchain clock behind him</a>.

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Dorsey answered simply, in the same monotone he used throughout the hearing, which tends to give the impression of someone who just can&#8217;t get worked up over yet another congressional dog-and-pony show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm,&#8221; Rice admonished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your multitasking skills are <em>quite</em> impressive,&#8221; she snarked, in a tone that did not seem to indicate she was actually impressed.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering, &#8220;Yes&#8221; was winning then and continues to win now, with 65.7% of the 65,626 total votes so far, compared with the just 34.3% who voted &#8220;No,&#8221; as of the time of writing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Matt Salzberg, who co-founded and served as CEO of meal kit startup Blue Apron <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/30/blue-apron-loses-its-ceo/">until 2017</a>, is back in the startup business with a new venture studio called <a href="https://materialcompanies.com/">Material</a>.</p>
<p>Along with Salzberg, Material is led by partners Andy Salamon (formerly a general partner at Atomic Labs who backed Hims and Terminal) and Danielle David Parks (co-founder of Jane Strategy). The studio has been operating for the past year and just closed its first $25 million fund.</p>
<p>Salzberg told me that Material will have &#8220;a very slow and deliberate approach to company creation.&#8221; That means deeply researching an industry (&#8220;We do more private-equity-style due diligence than venture-capital-style diligence&#8221;), identifying an opportunity and recruiting an executive to found the company alongside the Material team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We act as their co-founders, literally, whether with respect to talent and recruiting or resources at our fund, we help very much with investor connections, we help with strategy, we help with relationships,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We let the co-founding CEOs handle the day-to-day decisions and as they bring in outside capital in future rounds, we transition into being more like board members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Salzberg added that his goal &#8220;isn’t to be a factory that churns out five companies a year, six or seven companies a year,&#8221; he said. And instead of being slightly involved in a lot of companies,&#8221;We like to have a lot to do with very few companies.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dtFL1pLugO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/30/blue-apron-loses-its-ceo/">Blue Apron loses its CEO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blue Apron loses its CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/30/blue-apron-loses-its-ceo/embed/#?secret=dtFL1pLugO" data-secret="dtFL1pLugO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Specifically, the Material team plans to launch two new startups every year. For the most part, Salzberg said the ideas for these companies will &#8220;almost always&#8221; originate within Material, because the goal is to start the companies &#8220;from scratch&#8221; rather than make seed investments. He admitted that this approach allows him to &#8220;derive personal satisfaction&#8221; from the process, but he argued that it&#8217;s financially sound as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s also the right investment strategy to create great risk-adjusted returns,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We de-risk the startup process with better vetted ideas, more experienced founders and we&#8217;re giving them a good amount of capital, $2 million to $4 million, from day one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Startups launched from Material include delivery-focused restaurant startup <a href="https://www.kitchentokitchen.com/">Kitchen to Kitchen</a> (led by former FreshDirect CEO Dean Furbish), an Amazon brand acquirer called <a href="https://www.sumabrands.com">Suma Brands</a> (led by former Dolls Kill COO Andrew Savage) and a sales startup that&#8217;s still in stealth mode.</p>
<p>New Material startups could be in any industry, but Salzberg said the team is particularly interested in e-commerce (not too surprising, given his background and Salamon&#8217;s) and the future of work.</p>

<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/embed/#?secret=igG0xKr8P1" data-secret="igG0xKr8P1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“I’ve been using cryptocurrency before this,” Tolokonnikova told TechCrunch, noting Pussy Riot members have been interested in blockchain technology since around 2015. “Masha [<a href="https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot/status/1354978494585815041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354978494585815041%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felcocoliche.com%2Fpussy-riots-masha-alekhina-arrested-again-for-protesting-against-putin%2F">Alyokhina</a>, Pussy Riot co-founder] had problems with her bank accounts. Whenever she would open one, the government would shut it down because she would use some of her money for protestors. Right now she can’t even have her own credit card.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now Tolokonnikova is raising hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ether this month by dropping a <a href="https://foundation.app/PussyRiot">four-part series of NFTs</a> for the group’s newest music video, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdw0xjjVFpI">Panic Attack</a>.” She says these profits will be donated to a clandestine <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/pussy-riots-first-nft-sales-will-benefit-victims-of-domestic-violence">women’s shelter</a> in Eastern Europe, which caters to women who violated social norms.</p>
<p>“Women in this region are still being treated as property. There’s a stigma. A lot of these women are queer or did something like smile at a stranger, things that are associated with shame on the whole family. If we publicized the location of this shelter, it would motivate people to find the shelter and try to destroy it,” Tolokonnikova said. “As an activist, it’s really exciting to see a tool that’s not controlled by any government.”</p>
<p>It might be easy to dismiss this NFT initiative as a publicity stunt for Pussy Riot’s first studio album, “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pussy-riot-new-song-rage-political-prisoners-aleksei-navalny-1121685/">Rage</a>,” scheduled for release in May. Plus, the NFT platform the group is using, <a href="https://foundation.app/PussyRiot">Foundation</a>, could censor the group and make it <a href="https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372165292751732740">difficult</a> for buyers to view or trade NFTs. Crypto collectibles, and any corresponding cryptocurrency earnings, are only censorship resistant when held in a creator’s personal wallet, not on a private company’s platform.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tolokonnikova said her “interest in the technology is long-lasting,” and that she’s already exploring ways to utilize crypto tools to subvert <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-work-female-artists-valued-work-male-artists">sexist power structures</a>. In addition to donating cryptocurrency to activists, Pussy Riot is also sponsoring an <a href="https://twitter.com/pussyrrriot/status/1373323275762167809">NFT scholarship program</a> to cover the Ethereum transaction fees for feminist artists.</p>
<p>“Right now it’s now only for activists and political art works,” she said. “It’s also about educating the Pussy Riot community … we are looking at ways to make NFTs more accessible at a lower price point.”</p>

Smith/Getty Images)</p></div></p>
<p>In the meantime, the group is working on collaborations with other <a href="https://foundation.app/ViktoriaModesta/spike-dance-5549">NFT artists</a> like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/20/-sp-amputee-pop-star-viktoria-modesta">Viktoria Modesta</a>, known for avant-garde fashions for people with disabilities. From Tolokonnikova’s perspective, NFTs offer a way for women artists to gain recognition from the traditional art world. She said that because Pussy Riot focused on performance art and digital art, traditional galleries and collectors rarely took her work seriously. Now, with crypto collectibles, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/even-nycs-highfalutin-guggenheim-museum-is-looking-at-nfts-job-posting-suggests">museums</a> and <a href="https://time.com/5947720/nft-art/">galleries</a> are taking note.</p>
<p>“That is a game-changing dynamic for so many artists who, for the first time in their careers, will be recognized as artists,” Tolokonnikova said. “Before, as part of Pussy Riot, I would use speaking fees or other types of event fees and use that to fund the performance art. I was never paid for the art directly. Now I’m focused on these NFT drops and I’m treating it really seriously.”</p>
<p>While many of the NFT boom’s breakaway stars are white men with traditional credentials and years of professional experience, like <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-beeple-crashed-the-art-world">Beeple</a> and <a href="https://www.trevorjonesart.com/nfts.html">Trevor Jones</a>, women like Tolokonnikova are a fast-growing segment of the crypto ecosystem. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/only-15-of-bitcoin-traders-are-women-broker-study-shows">Crypto exchange surveys</a> show women make up roughly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/meet-the-entrepreneurs-bringing-bitcoin-to-institutions/">15% to 50%</a> percent of tallied users, depending on the region. Organizations like <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/as-interest-in-nft-art-rises-a-look-at-whats-next-on-metakovans-list/articleshow/81653483.cms?from=mdr">Metapurse</a>, <a href="https://she256.org/mentorship/">She256</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/meta-gamma-delta/meta-gamma-delta-grants-round-f12c4b17e035">Meta Gamma Delta</a> offer some mentorship and funding opportunities for women, as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Metapurse is already doing some of this work, but we want to make our own tiny steps to bring more female and queer artists in the space,” Tolokonnikova concluded. “I think it provides amazing tools for the business of the creators’ market. It’s more than just for art. It enhances a creator’s power.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Wednesday, a coalition of a dozen state attorneys general <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ag_letter_to_tech_ceos.pdf">called on Facebook and Twitter</a> to step up their enforcement of their community guidelines to curtail the spread of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on their platforms. Their letter specifically identified 12 &#8220;anti-vaxxer&#8221; accounts that were responsible for a sizable 65% of public anti-vaccine content on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. In today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">House hearing on disinformation and extremism</a>, Twitter and Facebook&#8217;s CEOs, along with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, were directly asked if they would be willing to take down these 12 accounts.</p>
<p>Their answers were a mixed bag and a demonstration of social media execs&#8217; unwillingness to take a simple action &#8212; taking down a handful of disinformation sources &#8212; that could have a significant impact on Americans&#8217; willingness to get vaccinated to end the pandemic.</p>
<p>Over the course of the hearing, Congressman Mike Doyle (D-PA) pointed out that nearly 550,000 Americans had lost their lives to COVID-19, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53820225">an independent study</a> found that Facebook users in five countries, including the U.S., had been exposed to COVID-19 disinformation 3.8 billion times. Now that the U.S. is rushing to get shots into people&#8217;s arms to reduce the spread of the deadly virus, it&#8217;s still having to deal with social media sites continuing to promote and recommend content leading to vaccine hesitancy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;My staff found content on YouTube telling people not to get vaccines, and was recommended to similar videos. The same was true on Instagram, where it was not only easy to find vaccine disinformation, but platforms recommended similar posts,&#8221; said Doyle. &#8220;The same thing happened on Facebook, except they also had anti-vax groups to suggest, as well. And Twitter was no different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take this content down,” Doyle said. “You can reduce the vision. You can fix this, but you choose not to,&#8221; he told the CEOs.</p>
<p>He later directly asked the CEOs if they would be willing to take down the 12 <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/544712-twelve-anti-vaxxers-are-responsible-for-two">accounts</a> the attorneys general had identified <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ag_letter_to_tech_ceos.pdf">in their letter</a> as the so-called &#8220;super-spreaders&#8221; of misinformation.</p>
<p>The coalition <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ag_letter_to_tech_ceos.pdf">had written</a> that both Facebook and Twitter had yet to remove the accounts of 12 prominent anti-vaxxers, who repeatedly violated the company&#8217;s terms of service. These users&#8217; accounts, associated organizations, groups and websites were responsible for 65% of public anti-vaccine content across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as of March 10, the letter noted.</p>
<p>In response to the question of taking down these dozen accounts, Zuckerberg hedged. He said that Facebook&#8217;s team would have to first look at the exact examples being referenced, leading to Doyle cutting him off.</p>
<p>Pichai tried to start his answer by noting that YouTube had removed more than 850,000 videos with misleading coronavirus information, but was also cut off as Doyle re-asked the question as to whether or not YouTube would take down the accounts of the 12 super-spreaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have policies to take down content,&#8221; Pichai said, but added that &#8220;some of the content is allowed, if it&#8217;s people&#8217;s personal experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was posed the same question, he said, &#8220;yes, we remove everything against our policy&#8221; &#8212; a better answer, but also one that&#8217;s not necessarily a confirmation that Twitter would, indeed, remove those specific 12 accounts.</p>
<p>Dorsey, earlier in the hearing, had also spoken broadly about Twitter&#8217;s long-term vision for dealing with misinformation, &#8220;Bluesky,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">its vision for a decentralized future</a>. He explained how Bluesky would leverage a base, open-source protocol that&#8217;s shared, allowing for &#8220;increased innovation around business models, recommendation algorithms, and moderation controls which are placed in the hands of individuals, rather than private companies,&#8221; Dorsey said. The answer indicated Twitter&#8217;s vision for moderation was ultimately about handing off the responsibility to others &#8212; something Facebook has also done in recent months with its Oversight Committee, an external body that will weigh in on the hardest moderation decisions.</p>
<p>These moves indicate that social networks have decided for themselves that they&#8217;re not capable of handling the responsibilities of content moderation on their own. But whether the U.S. government will actually step in to regulate them as result still remains to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with Reuters six days after the attack on the U.S. Capitol, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg infamously downplayed her company’s role in the day’s horrific events, which left five people dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think these events were largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate and don’t have our standards and don’t have our transparency,” Sandberg <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4kbd5KqbIM&amp;amp;ab_channel=Reuters">said at the time</a>, touting Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">very recent and far from thorough efforts</a> to remove QAnon, conspiracies and violent militias.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Thursday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">hearing with the House Energy and Commerce committee</a>, lawmakers circled back to Sandberg’s denial, but Facebook still didn&#8217;t have a good answer.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his opening statements, Zuckerberg said that Facebook “did our part” to protect the U.S. election and placed the blame on the actions of former President Donald Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe that the former </span>president<span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be responsible for his words and that the people who broke the law should be responsible for their actions,” Zuckerberg wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if Facebook “bears some responsibility” for spreading election misinformation and the Stop the Steal movement, Zuckerberg deflected, declining to answer directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How is it possible for you not to at least admit that Facebook played a leading role in the recruitment, planning and execution of the attack on the capitol?&#8221; Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA) asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pressed again, Zuckerberg passed the buck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the responsibility lies with the people who took the actions to break the law and do the insurrection,” he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Secondarily, also with the people who spread that content, including the president but others as well, with repeated rhetoric over time, saying that the election was rigged and encouraging people to organize, I think that those people bear the primary responsibility as well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doyle wasn’t having it, arguing that Facebook “supercharged” the dangerous rhetoric, which spread like wildfire on the platform before the January 6 attack. As Doyle pointed out, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBI showed that insurrectionists used Facebook during the “recruitment, planning and execution” stages of the attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) brought up the Sandberg interview specifically, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My question for you is, will you admit today that Facebook groups in particular played a role in fomenting the extremism that we saw, and that led to the Capitol siege?” Schakowsky asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The comment that Sheryl made, what I believe that we were trying to say and what I stand behind is what was widely reported at the time … &#8221; Zuckerberg began, before Schakowsky told him to get to the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Certainly there was content on our services,” Zuckerberg said vaguely. “And from that perspective, I think that there&#8217;s further work we need to do to make our services and moderation more effective.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the fact that the Stop the Steal movement<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-takes-down-stop-the-steal-2020-group-organizing-around-false-claims-of-election-chicanery/"> swelled to enormous numbers in Facebook groups</a>, insurrectionist leaders relied on Facebook to communicate and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/capitol-siege-far-right-rioters-used-facebook-to-hunt-lawmakers-fbi-2021-1">hunt for lawmakers on the day of the attack</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That shouldn’t have come as a surprise to the company: The militia members who hatched a plot to capture or kill Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-takes-down-stop-the-steal-2020-group-organizing-around-false-claims-of-election-chicanery/">also relied on the platform to organize and communicate</a>, according to FBI affidavits. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle manufacturers are pushing back against a decision to delay penalty increases for automakers who fail to meet fuel efficiency standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lobbying group representing legacy automakers — many of whom are now making substantial investments in zero-emissions vehicles — said the increase would have a significant economic impact during a time when the industry is facing mass disruption from the COVID pandemic. But new EV entrants say the penalty mechanism is a powerful performance incentive to decrease tailpipe emissions and encourage investment in lower- or zero-emissions technology.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision, issued in January by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), postpones imposing a penalty increase from the beginning of model year 2019 to model year 2022. Tesla is petitioning the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to review the ruling, saying that the delay “inflicts ongoing, irreparable injury” on the company and creates an “uneven playing field” by reducing the consequences of nonadherence.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) penalty has been increased just once — from $5 to $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon that doesn’t meet the standard — since its instatement in 1975. Congress acted to rectify the effects of inflation on the penalty by raising it to $14 in 2015, but NHTSA and the courts have ping-ponged about the increase ever since. A decision from the Second Circuit last August seemed to settle the issue in favor of instating the higher penalty starting with model year 2019, but automakers last October successfully petitioned that the increase be delayed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CAFE penalty can be a huge boon for zero emissions automakers, who receive credits that they can then sell to other OEMs who fail to meet the fuel efficiency target. In a</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report to regulators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Tesla said it earned $1.58 billion from selling regulatory credits to other automakers in 2020, up from $594 million in 2019. Delaying the increase harms companies that have made economic decisions on the basis of an increase to the credit, Tesla said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV startups Rivian and Lucid Motors told TechCrunch they also oppose any delay to increasing the CAFE penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The credit market is very beneficial for the entire EV industry, so every company that is looking to start building EVs, either as a startup or the existing manufacturers, when they build EVs it’s to their benefit to have robust credits,” Kevin Vincent, Lucid Motor’s Associate General Counsel, told TechCrunch. “A lot of existing manufacturers end up selling credits themselves, so it benefits the forward-thinking companies that are improving fuel economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Chen, Rivian’s VP of Public Policy and Chief Regulatory Counsel, said in a statement to TechCrunch that any rollback of the CAFE or other emission standard “only sets the U.S. backward in terms of emission reductions ([greenhouse gas] and criteria pollutants), increased fuel efficiency, reduction of dependence on foreign oil, technology leadership and EV proliferation.” He added that the company “strongly supports efforts to bolster EV adoption that includes more stringent emission standards and higher penalties for failure to meet those standards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NHTSA postponed the increase on the grounds that the penalty should not be retroactively applied to model years that had already been manufactured. As manufacturers have no way to increase the fuel economy level in these vehicles, “it would be inappropriate to apply the adjustment to model years that could have no deterrence effect and promote no additional compliance with the law,” NHTSA said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automakers, in a petition filed by the lobbying group Alliance for Automotive Innovation and in supplemental comments, also cited economic hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mercedes-Benz told NHTSA that the pandemic caused disruptions to its supply chain, workforce and production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that retroactively applying an increased penalty rate in such a tenuous financial climate is unconscionable and inconsistent with this administration’s efforts to promote regulatory relief in light of the economic consequences of COVID-19,” the automaker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla maintained in its court filing that relying on the COVID pandemic “falls flat” in the absence of specific evidence as to why it warrants the delay.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney generals from 16 states, including California and New York, as well as environmental groups Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, have also objected to the delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NHTSA decision was issued in docket no. NHTSA-2021-0001. Tesla filed with the second circuit under case no. 21-593.</span></p>

		Ariane de Bonvoisin is an executive coach to top CEOs, startup founders and VCs. She has keynoted the Oprah conference, given a TED talk, and been invited to Google, Amazon, the World Bank, Union Square Ventures and Red Bull to teach about navigating change and founder and startup wellness. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The business world has a love-hate relationship with coaching. Founders are visionaries: They start with an idea, a talent, a dream, but not necessarily the business know-how. Because being an entrepreneur doesn’t require a license or training — Jeff Bezos is an engineer and computer scientist; Elon Musk is an economist and physicist, and so on.</p>
<p>In any other industry, when someone with raw talent — an athlete, a singer, an actor — furthers their career, the first thing they receive is a coach. And it doesn’t stop once they get their first Olympic gold or Grammy.</p>
<p>Coaches don’t leave their side until they hang up their gloves. Tiger Woods is famous for having worked with many coaches to switch up his tactics and keep exceeding in his performance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			In any other industry, when someone with raw talent — an athlete, a singer, an actor — furthers their career, the first thing they receive is a coach.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Despite a culture that pushes founders to the edge of their physical, mental and personal limits as they build their company, we insist that they fly solo. They’re led to believe that reaching out for support is a sign of weakness.</p>
<p>That stigma is a huge part of the problem. We look up to business magnates, believing that they sailed from a college dorm to the C-suite without breaking a sweat. But we don’t see the vigorous kicking that goes on beneath the surface. As a client of mine once mused, even the best leaders are self-sabotaging themselves at least 30% of the time. I know for a fact that top Silicon Valley billionaires have nutrition, parenting, meditation and life coaches, but they — like half of my own clients — are reluctant to embrace this out in the open.</p>
<p>VCs know that they don’t invest in the business; they invest in the person.<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/access-to-mental-health-startups-tackle-sectors-complexities-as-investors-go-all-in/"> Record amounts</a> of money are being funneled into mental wellness startups right now, but investors also need to direct that awareness toward their founders&#8217; well-being. By offering access to a coach to all your portfolio founders, you’ll be tackling the real problems stopping them from pouring their energy into their business, and you’ll without a doubt improve your returns.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Business is not always a founder’s main problem</strong></h2>
<p>I coach founders and CEOs of startups, and more than half their main life challenges are <em>not</em> work related. They’re getting pulled in multiple directions — some have cancer, others are having an affair, a few are going through IVF, others still are dealing with past grief and traumas.</p>
<p>And when a problem is work related, it’s often a communication or psychological issue: How do I face my fear of failure? How do I lead a team of 50 for the first time? Should I trust my gut?</p>
<p>All this is happening in the midst of Series A raises, hiring and firing employees, acquisitions, and deciding whether to bridge or shut down the business. Imagine how much emotional energy and hours it takes for founders — or anyone, really — to face those intimate issues in isolation while putting on a brave face with investors or at board meetings.</p>
<p>One of the most recurring concerns founders share with me is that they feel alone.</p>

<p>VCs, when you choose to fund someone, you’re also marrying into their past, their family, their personal issues. The full package. Ask yourself — do you currently know the major distractions in the lives of all your portfolio founders? If you don’t, start with the assumption that something is going on in their life other than work and make coaching available to them at any time.</p>
<p>If you commit to helping founders manage their fears, limiting beliefs and blind spots, you’re committing to their potential as a company and industry leader. A healthy leadership is a healthy company.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Return on coaching (ROC)</strong></h2>
<p>As with elite soccer coaches, the benefits of business coaching are highly visible, without the million-dollar expense. Founders start to make better decisions the first time around. They hire the right talent, rather than hiring, onboarding and firing someone within a month.</p>
<p>They have more honest conversations with stakeholders, avoiding conflict and allowing more people to contribute meaningfully to the business’ growth. They have the proper mindset to fundraise, and their attitude matches the money they’re asking for.</p>
<p>That’s before getting to the physical improvements. My founders have lost weight, stopped smoking and drinking, and have more energy to build a business. If a founder works with chronic fatigue, which many are, it won’t be long before their body cracks. I get calls from clients caught in panic attacks before big meetings, struggling to steady their frayed nerves.</p>
<p>You can fund your founders’ well-being in a variety of ways. In the same way your firm might offer marketing or PR services to portfolio companies, coaching should be part of the package. Firms can make executive coaches available on retainer. You may choose to have a full-time resident coach, available whenever someone needs them.</p>
<p>At the very least, firms should make available a list of recommended coaches. Some coaches specialize in leadership coaching, female founders or health specifically, while others cover various personal and professional skills.</p>
<p>Investors will sometimes offer a handful of free sessions to their founders, but if they want to continue, they are then forced to decide between their personal health and the health of the business — which other people (including your firm) have staked millions of dollars on. It should never be a case of one or the other.</p>
<p>My hope is that in the future, VCs will set aside a percentage of their funds exclusively for mental wellness for founders and executives.</p>
<p>A few VCs have already taken a<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90461861/im-a-vc-and-this-is-how-im-investing-in-founders-mental-health"> 1% pledge</a>, but it’s the Europeans who are leading the charge here, with funds from Estonia to Ireland generously covering all founder coaching fees and other support programs. Those I know talk about how 10x growth is possible without burnout.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Cut through the stigma to enable founders to make the most of coaching</strong></h2>
<p>Founders are resistant to hiring a coach themselves because they’re worried about what their investors and board will think of them. They tell themselves: “If I were normal, and good enough, I wouldn’t need one.”</p>
<p>It’s not just their inner voice talking. When a client of mine joined a Silicon Valley startup, he asked his superiors if coaching could be part of his comp package. They wondered why he needed a coach.</p>
<p>In other industries, connecting someone with a coach is proof of their worth. That’s the conversation investors should be having: You’re good enough for us to give you money, so we’re going to give you someone to accompany you on your journey, so you don’t pretend you can figure it out at every step.</p>
<p>There’s also a negative connotation around the term “mental health” that we should be reframing. Those two words tend to make people think about depression, suicidal thoughts or addiction. Which is mental <em>un</em>health. Let’s talk more about mental wellness and founder well-being, which focuses us on the goal we’re working toward.</p>
<p>Eliminating the stigma can start with open conversations about well-being between investors and executives, as well as inviting a coach to talk to your founders about what these sessions entail, and why everyone has something to gain. By shattering the taboo, you’ll enable founders to make the absolute most of that experience, rather than hold back to keep up appearances.</p>
<p>If we start making coaching mainstream today, we might eventually see it as obligatory for all founders.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Lead by example</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, business leaders and investors need to set an example for the startup community, and especially people at the start of their journeys, that it’s OK to ask for assistance in bettering yourself.</p>
<p>Many VCs, like top CEOs, have coaches. If more simply owned it, they’d have so much power to normalize coaching, and even make #IHaveACoach fashionable. After all, we’re talking about the same industry that made meditation rooms trendy and kombucha an office feature.</p>
<p>Why not make coaching a central topic in future investor conferences, or, as a VC firm, publish a study on how portfolio founders who followed a coaching program saw greater business success?</p>
<p>For example: For years, Union Square Ventures has invested in providing value to their founders and has built a team whose responsibilities include developing leadership training, fostering mentorship circles and connecting founders to coaches. If you let founders see your commitment to human issues, it won’t occur to them that being human is being weak.</p>
<p>These approaches are also important self-promotion for VCs positioning themselves as the next generation of ethical investors. With so many alternative funding options becoming available, founders are seeking VCs who give them more than just capital and who see wellness and diversity and inclusion as inextricable from success.</p>
<p>Founder health and startup health can’t be separated from each other. On some level, all investors know this. So let’s give the people shaping tomorrow’s world the tools to be more comfortable in their own skin and more masterful in leading teams to achieve greatness and incredible returns.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While it's not likely that we'll be driving around wearing VR headsets anytime soon, in-car AR is already changing the way we travel, and it promises to continue to evolve.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Augmented and virtual reality have been used for years in gaming, design and shopping. Now, a new battle for market share is emerging — inside vehicles.</p>
<p>Safety-glass windshields offer a new opportunity for suppliers, manufacturers and startups that are starting to adapt this technology: AR overlays digital information or images on what a user sees in the real world, while VR creates a seemingly real experience that changes as they move through it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Despite all of the pomp and promises about the technology&#8217;s potential, there isn&#8217;t a clear understanding of market demand for bringing AR and VR to cars, trucks and passenger vans.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The potential for monetizing AR/VR is hamstrung by a number of factors: The long, expensive timelines required to develop, tool and test an automotive-grade product has constrained development to a small subset of startups and several large suppliers.</p>
<p>Despite all of the pomp and promises about the technology&#8217;s potential, there isn&#8217;t a clear understanding of market demand for bringing AR and VR to cars, trucks and passenger vans. Estimates of the global market range from <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/virtual-reality-vr-in-automotive-market-101702">$14 billion by 2027</a> to as much as <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/automotive-ar-and-vr-market">$673 billion by 2025</a>. That wide range shows just how nascent the market currently is and how much opportunity is present.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the vehicle manufacturer level, companies are witnessing a complete shift of emphasis of what their product offering is, to the user. Because of that change of emphasis, there&#8217;s a whole new paradigm of what the car is,&#8221; said Andy Travers, the CEO of Ceres, a Scottish company that specializes in creating holographic glass for AR applications. &#8220;There is a huge interest in AR and transparent displays because a car is no longer really differentiated by its engine size, especially as we get into electric vehicles. They are going to be identical skateboards. The question then becomes, how do you differentiate an electric car? You push it toward the user experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that the implementation of automotive AR (and in limited situations, VR) has been and will continue to be slow. It will largely lag the wider AR and VR market for a number of reasons. Vehicle systems &#8212; especially those using computing power and technology needed for AR and VR &#8212; must be robust enough to handle tremendous temperature swings, rough jostling and impacts over anywhere from three to 10 years, even if <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/tesla-recalls-135000-vehicles-over-touchscreen-failures/">Tesla says that</a> &#8220;it is economically, if not technologically, infeasible to expect that such components can or should be designed to last the vehicle&#8217;s entire useful life.&#8221;</p>
<p>These systems have to be nearly indestructible in extreme conditions for a very long period of time. They must also be compact and power-efficient, especially as electric vehicles become more prevalent. You don&#8217;t want your AR or VR system draining your battery and leaving you stranded.</p>
<p>As an example of just how much the automotive technology landscape differs from the consumer realm, consider how long it took for touchscreens to show up in vehicle cockpits. While Buick offered a <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/first-car-with-touchscreen-infotainment/">rudimentary touchscreen</a> in its 1986 Riviera, it was not the easy-to-use interface we&#8217;re used to today thanks to the advent of the iPhone.</p>
<p>This is partially due to the three- to seven-year iteration cycles most vehicle makers are on and because the technology simply wasn&#8217;t familiar enough to the consumer market to make widespread adoption profitable. In their current form, AR and VR have seen a far more successful uptake rate in industrial usage and application, in part because the technology is still so pricey.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to exclude a discussion about the development of autonomous driving in this AR and VR conversation, too. The technology is instrumental in the development of fully autonomous vehicles, and while there are no full-autonomous vehicles on the road today, automakers are pushing to make them more than just vaporware.</p>
<h2>The players</h2>
<p>Many well-established brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen already offer a suite of AR features in their top-end vehicles. Automotive suppliers like Continental, Denso, Visteon, ZF, Nvidia, Bosch, Panasonic and others are the biggest players in the AR and VR automotive space, supplying and making head-up displays (HUDs) and related components for a variety of established automakers.</p>
<p>Most of the AR features in these vehicles are focused on overlaying directional guides over camera images to help drivers navigate in unfamiliar territories or identify a particular building or landmark. Virtual reality, thus far, has been largely applied to the design, sales, demonstration and education of consumers about new technology and features in vehicles, although companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/audi-spins-out-holoride-to-put-vr-in-every-car/">Audi spinoff Holoride</a> are working to offer passengers VR experiences that can help cut down on in-car motion sickness while simultaneously offering gaming, entertainment or business applications. Even ride-hailing companies are getting in on the AR and VR game, with Lyft and Uber <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qve9gq/uber-wants-to-fill-the-boredom-of-self-driving-cars-with-vr">exploring AR and VR options</a> for riders.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the challenges that some would-be TikTok rivals have faced is that they often lack the same robust set of content creation tools, like filters, effects and tools for repurposing others&#8217; content &#8212; like TikTok&#8217;s Stitch and Duet, for example. It now appears that Snapchat is working to correct that latter problem, however, as it&#8217;s been spotted working on a TikTok Duets-like feature called &#8220;Remix,&#8221; designed for replying to Snaps. This feature will allow users to create new content using their friends&#8217; Snaps &#8212; a &#8220;remix,&#8221; that is.</p>
<p>Initially, the feature will allow users to reply to a friend&#8217;s story with a remixed Snap. To do so, you can record your own Snap alongside the original as it plays &#8212; much like a TikTok Duet.</p>
<p>The feature, which Snap confirms has launched into external testing, follows Instagram&#8217;s public test of a similarly named &#8220;Remix&#8221; feature focused on Reels content. (It had also<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1281545293146750978"> tested a version for Stories</a> as a first step.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In Instagram&#8217;s case, the company explains that Remix lets anyone create an Instagram Reel where your video and theirs play side by side. This is, essentially, Instagram&#8217;s own version of TikTok Duets, a tool that&#8217;s often used to interact with other TikTok users&#8217; content. In Duets, TikTok users can sing, dance, joke or act alongside another user&#8217;s video; cook someone else&#8217;s recipe; record reaction videos; boost videos from lesser-known creators; and more. It&#8217;s a core part of what makes TikTok feel like a social network, rather than just a platform for more passive video viewing.</p>
<p>Last fall, <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/feature-highlight-new-layouts-for-duet">TikTok announced</a> it was introducing several new layout options for Duets in addition to the left-right layout, including a new top-bottom layout, a special &#8220;react&#8221; layout and a three-screen layout.</p>
<p>Some of those same Duet formats and others now appear to be under consideration by Snap, as well.</p>
<p>In its Remix feature, Snapchat users are presented with a screen where they can choose from a variety of options for combining Snaps &#8212; including the side-by-side and top-and-bottom formats, as well as others like where content is overlaid or where you could react to a Snap.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130277" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130277" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2130277" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?w=382" alt="" width="382" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=768,1368 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=862,1536 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz10gXIAMTk-6.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130277" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Photo of Snapchat&#8217;s Remix feature via<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1375062264215187456" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> @alex193a on Twitter </a></p></div></p>
<p>According to reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a">Alessandro Paluzzi,</a> who first spotted the addition, Remix also offers a way for users to tag friends or other people they want to have permission to either remix or share their Snap via a new toggle switch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130279" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130279" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130279" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="567" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?resize=768,640 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1fgXIAAnULq.jpeg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130279" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1375062264215187456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photo of Snapchat&#8217;s Remix feature via @alex193a on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>It appears that users will be able to access the &#8220;Remix&#8221; feature from the same menu where you can today either report a Snap or send it to others.</p>
<p>This menu, of course, is also available from within Snapchat&#8217;s new TikTok competitor, known as Spotlight,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/"> launched last year.</a></p>
<p>Though initially Remix is being tested among friends, we understand that it&#8217;s expected to make its way to other parts of the Snapchat app in time. And likely this would include Spotlight. Much like TikTok, Spotlight offers a video feed filled with short-form, entertaining videos that you can scroll through with up and down swipes, often set to popular music &#8212; thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/snapchat-to-take-on-tiktok-with-a-new-music-powered-featuring-rolling-out-this-fall/">Snap&#8217;s music industry deals</a>. This would be a natural fit for Remixes, as it&#8217;s a common way for users to interact with each others&#8217; content to create a dialog.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130278" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130278" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ExUz1pJWQAcPJ9L.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130278" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Photo of Snapchat&#8217;s Remix feature via<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1375062264215187456" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> @alex193a on Twitter <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Snap confirmed with TechCrunch it&#8217;s beginning to test Remix on its app.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can confirm that externally we are testing the ability to reply to a friend&#8217;s story with a remixed Snap,&#8221; a spokesperson said. &#8220;It lets you build on your friend&#8217;s Snap while recording your own alongside the original as it plays for contextual conversations on Snapchat,&#8221; they noted.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t offer an ETA for a broader rollout at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Austin-based home lab testing kit startup <a href="https://www.everlywell.com">Everlywell</a> is expanding its scope considerably with two acquisitions, and a transformation that includes the establishment of a new parent company led by Everlywell CEO and co-founder Julia Cheek. The new entity, called Everly Health, will now offer services including at-home lab testing kits and education, population-scale testing through a U.S.-wide clinician network, telehealth and a payer-supported/enterprise self-collected lab test.</p>
<p>This is a big move for Everlywell, which was founded in 2015 (and which was a finalist in TechCrunch&#8217;s 2016 Disrupt SF Battlefield completion). The company has steadily iterated on its offerings, expanding its at-home testing from fertility products to food sensitivities and allergies, and last year, to at-home COVID-19 test collection.</p>
<p>Everly Health&#8217;s business now includes not only that kind of at-home consumer diagnostic and personal health education, but also many relationships through PWNHealth, which will rebrand to Everly Health Solutions, with health plans, employers and labs across the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Everlywell itself was actually a longtime partner of PNWHealth, which is what Cheek told me an in interview actually helped make the acquisition make so much sense to both companies. They&#8217;d been working together for years, and that collaboration had only deepened in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we found over the last year was we were collaborating on all these different enterprise partnerships to offer solutions, and so our cultures are really well aligned, and our teams have worked closely together,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And we both share this common ethos that we felt the urgent need to help people and to save lives, but also this discipline around consumer-friendly and enabled care, grounded in diagnostics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, Cheek said that the decision to go out and acquire the pieces of the puzzle needed to deliver a more comprehensive care offering was partly driven by the pandemic, but that really just drove an acceleration of what Everlywell was already beginning to see before COVID-19. Freshly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/everlywell-raises-175-million-to-expand-virtual-care-options-and-scale-its-at-home-health-testing/">capitalized with the $175 million it raised last December</a>, the startup was in a position to make some bold moves in order to make the most of the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before the pandemic, but especially during and looking out to post-pandemic, we have just seen this massive acceleration of the need for consumer friendly testing services,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our business has continued to grow exponentially, even since normal doctor&#8217;s appointments resumed, orders of magnitude, 300% growth. We sat back and said, since we believe healthcare is in a watershed moment post-pandemic, where do we think we need to actually be able to offer a full-service diagnostic solution as this entire space grows. So it&#8217;s Everlywell as a consumer-friendly brand, but it&#8217;s also this massive enterprise need for home testing, and broader consumer diagnostics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new acquisitions do add some complexity to Everly Health&#8217;s business, since its Everly Health Solutions also serves a number of customers that would be considered competitive with Everlywell. Cheek points out that both businesses have a demonstrated track record of security and data integrity, compliant with HIPAA standards, and says that they&#8217;re setting up a strict firewall that will result in &#8220;complete data independence&#8221; of Everly Health Solutions to ensure there&#8217;s no possibility of anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>The companies will however share customer experience, design and product resources, however, and the plan is to build a unified brand focused on high-quality customer engagement across the board.</p>
<p>Everly Health hasn&#8217;t released the financial details of the transaction, but it has shared shared that PWNHealth CEO Sanjay Pingle will be acting in a transitional role in the combined company for the time being, and will serve on the board of Everly Health. Investors in PWNHealth, including Spectrum Equity, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield corporate VC Blue Venture Fund will also retain an ownership stake in Everly Health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Design and marketing consultancy R/GA is expanding its Venture Studios program with the launch of a new <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com">Coalition Venture Studio</a> focused specifically on supporting Black-led and Black-owned startups.</p>
<p>The initiative is led by R/GA Entrepreneur in Residence Davyeon Ross, a Black entrepreneur who founded<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/19/shottracker-raises-5m-in-seed-funding-from-magic-johnson-and-david-stern-to-bring-real-time-analytics-to-nba-teams/"> sports analytics company ShotTracker</a>. The startup (which is backed by TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company Verizon, <a href="http://www.verizonventures.com/blog/2021/1/shottracker-secures-$11m-financing-led-by-evertz-technologies-and-verizon-ventures/">specifically Verizon Ventures</a>) was part of R/GA&#8217;s Dodgers Accelerator, and Ross attributed much of ShotTracker&#8217;s success to connections made by the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;From that perspective, I got this firsthand view of the power of R/GA Ventures,&#8221; Ross told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To participate in the Coalition Venture Studio, startups must be majority Black-owned or have a Black CEO, CTO or board chair. However, Ross said that it won&#8217;t be using a traditional application process, and it won&#8217;t be limited to a handful of startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not going to be cohorts or batches of companies,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The thought process is, it’s an ongoing initiative [ … ] A big piece of this is, it&#8217;s not an application process, it&#8217;s a registration process. Once we work with R/GA to vet the companies, we can start positioning them for projects within the R/GA agency.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="coTW68Vo17"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/black-tech-nation-ventures/">Black Tech Nation Ventures is a new fund for Black entrepreneurs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Black Tech Nation Ventures is a new fund for Black entrepreneurs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/black-tech-nation-ventures/embed/#?secret=coTW68Vo17" data-secret="coTW68Vo17" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In other words, assuming a company qualifies, they&#8217;ll become eligible for three main kinds of support through the Coalition program — creative capital (consulting, design, copywriting and other services), relationship capital (introductions to what Ross described as R/GA&#8217;s &#8220;network of incredible blue chip clients&#8221;) and financial capital (which could come from a syndicate led by R/GA Ventures).</p>
<p>This launch comes after last year&#8217;s protests over the killing of George Floyd led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">a broader conversation</a> about race and representation in startups and venture capital. Ross said he&#8217;s encouraged by that conversation — but at the same time, only 1% of VC money was <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/06/a-vcs-guide-to-investing-in-black-founders">deployed with Black entrepreneurs last year</a>, and there&#8217;s a risk that the industry could move on without addressing systemic issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a society, we tend to be very short term,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We say, &#8216;Oh my goodness, that happened,&#8217; and then we go about our lives [ … ] That&#8217;s why I was excited that R/GA reached out to make this commitment. Part of this is about accountability, part of this is about easy options for folks to get involved, part of this is about storytelling. A lot of companies made statements, so this is just providing them with vehicles to be able to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end, Coalition has already signed up a number of <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com/partners/">partners</a>, including several from the startup and VC world like Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s TxO Initiative, Harlem Capital, Collab Capital, Ohub, Mac Venture Capital and Gingerbread Capital. R/GA&#8217;s parent company IPG is also a partner, as are the Dodgers and Elysian Park (home to Dodger Stadium).</p>
<p>Eligible startups can register <a href="https://www.coalitionventurestudio.com/startups/">on the Coalition website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup from Europe is joining the race to become the first big provider of lab-grown fish.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bluu.bio/">Bluu Biosciences</a> has raised €7 million in a round of financing from investors including Manta Ray Ventures, Norrsken VC, Be8, CPT Capital and Lever VC to compete with a host of startups like BluNalu, Wild Type and Shiok Meats in a bid to market with a lab-grown fish replacement.</p>
<p>The market for sustainable fish is huge and growing. Already, concerns over the effects of overfishing and industrial fish farming are mounting as demand for fish increases. It&#8217;s the same problem that other animal-based sources of protein face. The amount of demand for high-quality sources of protein from the Earth&#8217;s several billion people cannot sustainably keep up with the available supply.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s why a number of cellular meat companies are focusing on fish instead of other meats like beef, pork or chicken.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of talent in Europe and very little companies built in this space. If you compare it to the mammalian space there are a lot fewer companies,&#8221; said Simon Fabich, co-founder and managing director of Bluu.  </span></p>
<p>At Berlin-based Bluu, the focus is on salmon, trout and carp (the most popular fish in China). Other companies are tackling tuna, salmon and shrimp, but Bluu sees carp as an especially attractive target, given its popularity in one of the world&#8217;s most populous countries.</p>
<p>One advantage for Bluu, its founders argue, is the deep experience that co-founder Sebastian Rakers has in the wild world of cultivated fish cells.</p>
<p>A marine and cell biologist who was working for several years at the Munich-based <a href="https://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html">Fraunhofer Institute</a>, one of Europe&#8217;s most celebrated research institutes, Rakers led a task force that looked at potential commercial viability of cell-based meat, after conducting research on the viability of using fish cells as a component for viral production for the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130292" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130292" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2130292" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020_10_13_Bluu40658.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130292" class="wp-caption-text">Bluu Biotechnologies co-founder Sebastian Rakers. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.bluu.bio/">Bluu Biosciences</a></p></div></p>
<p>During his research Rakers cultivated 80 different cell cultures for more than 20 different species of fish. What&#8217;s more, he was able to make these cell lines immortal.</p>
<p>Before envisioning an endless, ever-producing mass of fish cells that could overwhelm the world, it might be worth explaining what immortal cell lines mean. Actually … the endless, ever-producing mass of self-reproducing fish cells comes pretty close.</p>
<p>Most cell lines tend to die off after reproducing a certain number of times, which means that to manufacture meat at scale can require several biopsies of the same animal to cultivate multiple cell lines at a time. Rakers said that Bluu could avoid that step, thanks to the work that had already been done to develop these &#8220;immortal&#8221; salmon, trout and carp cell cultivars.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s such a strong competitive advantage,&#8221; said Fabich. &#8220;If you have normal cells that are not immortalized you can only proliferate 20 to 25 times and then you need to start again from another biopsy. With immortalized cells you can grow up to 100,000 times and we can double it every day.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>With this technology in hand, Rakers said he was thinking about what could come next in his own career and met up with Gary Lin, an impact investor and the founder of <a href="https://www.purpleorange.com/">Purple Orange Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Lin connected Rakers with Fabich and the two men set off to commercialize Rakers&#8217; research as Bluu. Even though there are several companies that have a head start in the market (and in funding), Rakers said that there are certain advantages to coming in late.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years ago there was hardly any company looking into media development, hardly any companies focused on bioreactor technologies at a very large scale and there was no company looking for scaffolding alternatives for cell-based meat,&#8221; he said. Now there are. </span></p>
<p>The company is picking up speed quickly thanks to those other technology providers that are coming to market and will look to have a prototype product out by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>The company is also pushing for regulation, which both Fabich and Rakers said were one of the last remaining obstacles to commercialization. Ultimately, the company has its eye firmly on the Asian market. &#8220;That&#8217;s the one that moves the needle,&#8221; in terms of sustainability, Fabich said. &#8220;We can have the biggest impact if we change production behavior there.&#8221;</p>
