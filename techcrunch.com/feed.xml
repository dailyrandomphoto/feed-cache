										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starlink, part of Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX company, has formed a subsidiary in India and is preparing to apply for licenses from the local government, according to a top official.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pleased to share that SpaceX now has a 100% owned subsidiary in India,&#8221; Sanjay Bhargava, India director for Starlink, said in a LinkedIn post Monday. Starlink&#8217;s local India unit is registered with the name Starlink Satellite Communications Private Limited.</p>
<p>A local unit is required for an internet company to offer its services in India, where Starlink &#8212; assuming that it gets the license &#8212; plans to offer 200,000 active terminals in over 160,000 districts by December 2022, the company representatives said. That&#8217;s an ambitious goal for the company, which as of August had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/spacex-ships-100000-starlink-terminals-to-customers-eyes-future-launches-using-starship/">shipped 100,000 user terminals in 14 countries</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227157" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bhargava, a former PayPal executive, started in the new role at the beginning of October. The company has hired a number of key executives in India in recent months including Parnil Urdhwareshe, who previously oversaw AMD’s policy efforts in India, as its Market Access Director for the local business.</p>
<p>A SpaceX spokesperson didn’t respond to a query in September about the appointment of Bhargava, but the company’s chief executive Elon Musk confirmed the development over the weekend.</p>
<p>Starlink, one of the leading companies that is launching small satellites to build a low-Earth orbiting network to provide low-latency broadband internet services, is aiming to serve rural communities in India, said Musk in a tweet, adding “Sanjay deserves a lot of credit for making X/PayPal succeed.”</p>
<p>In another LinkedIn post, Bhargava said, “at Starlink, we want to serve the underserved. We hope to work with fellow broadband providers, solution providers in the aspirational districts to improve and save lives.” The company said over the weekend that it working with Niti Aayog, a powerful Indian think tank, to identify 12 districts in the country for Starlink&#8217;s initial deployment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as more than half a billion people are online in India, just as many are still offline. According to industry estimates, hundreds of millions of Indians living in rural areas don&#8217;t have access to any broadband network.</p>
<p>“The government approval process is complex. So far there is no application pending with the government, so the ball is in our court to apply for consideration which we are working on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our approach will be to get pilot approval quickly if Pan India approval will take long. We are optimistic that we will get approval for a pilot program or Pan India approval in the next few months,” said Bhargava last month, adding that if it fails to get the government approval, the actual number of terminals it may end up deploying by the end of next year will be “much lower than that or even zero.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In good news for its peers that may seek to go public, the numbers Nubank has shared in its IPO filing seem to make pretty reasonable business sense.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the neobanking boom has matured into a collection of large digital banks, we&#8217;re slowly getting a better picture of the economics of such business efforts. Chime was </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">early in telling the market that it was EBTIDA positive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, unlike less profitable European neobanks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upcoming Nubank IPO — technically the public offering of Nu, but we&#8217;ll just say Nubank for simplicity — provides us with far more information and detail regarding the operations of a neobank at scale, </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001691493/000119312521314359/d213207df1.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thanks to its newly-public filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In good news for its peers that may seek to go public, the numbers Nubank has shared seem to make pretty reasonable business sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will have more notes in time regarding the company&#8217;s offering, its shareholders, its varying business lines, and more. This morning, we&#8217;re narrowing our focus to the broad economics of neobanking, and will end with an examination of Nubank&#8217;s aggregate financial health. We&#8217;ll take just a second at the end to test a few valuation marks against what we find.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a neobank at scale is not cheap. Leading startups and unicorns in the market niche have raised tectonic sums of capital to get to where they are today. But what did all that cash buy them? In Nubank&#8217;s case, quite a lot, it appears.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5ql2LDM23N"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/">The Nubank EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Nubank EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1/embed/#?secret=5ql2LDM23N" data-secret="5ql2LDM23N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>The economics of neobanking</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nubank is one o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f the most valuable startups in the world, with over 40 million users across Brazil, as well as Mexico and Colombia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks, like any consumer product, can be viewed through the lenses of customer acquisition costs, customer monetization and activity, and long-term revenues. We want to know what Nubank pays to attract new users, how their product use and rates thereof translate to income, and how much the fintech giant can juice users for over a longer time horizon.</span></p>
<h3>Customer acquisition costs</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nubank is proud of its customer acquisition costs (CAC). The company states in its F-1 filing that its CAC was &#8220;US$5.0 per customer of which paid marketing accounted for approximately 20%&#8221; for the first three quarters of 2021. That&#8217;s lower than we anticipated, frankly.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As access to unique sounds is becoming a competitive advantage for social apps, Snapchat announced today it&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/nbcuniversal-sounds">inked a deal</a> with NBCUniversal to give users access to licensed audio clips from various NBCU movies and TV shows. With this latest launch, users can add audio clips from fan favorites such as &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; and &#8220;The Office&#8221; to their Snaps, then send them to other users or post them to Snapchat Spotlight.</p>
<p>When someone sends you a Snap with a sound, you’ll be able to swipe up to view the title of the movie or TV series that the audio is from. A “Play This Sound” link will open a webpage that will display the streaming platforms where you can watch whichever movie or TV show the audio is from.</p>
<p>The audio catalog includes popular TV shows and movies like &#8220;The 40 Year Old Virgin,&#8221; Back to the Future,&#8221; &#8220;Billy Madison,&#8221; &#8220;Bridesmaids,&#8221; &#8220;Forgetting Sarah Marshall,&#8221; &#8220;Happy Gilmore,&#8221; &#8220;Scarface,&#8221; &#8220;Shrek,&#8221; &#8220;The Office,&#8221; &#8220;Parks and Recreation,&#8221; &#8220;Saturday Night Live,&#8221; &#8220;Law &amp; Order,&#8221; &#8220;Brooklyn Nine-Nine,&#8221; &#8220;30 Rock,&#8221; &#8220;Friday Night Lights,&#8221; and others. The deal additionally includes audio from Peacock Originals, like &#8220;Saved by the Bell,&#8221; &#8220;Girls5eva,&#8221; and &#8220;A.P. Bio.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227078" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“NBCUniversal has an iconic catalog and we know Snapchatters will love adding quotes from their favorite movies and series to their Snaps to help perfectly express the moment,” said Ben Schwerin, Snap’s senior vice president of content and partnerships, in a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Snapchat also has partnerships with numerous studios and companies within the music industry, including Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, NMPA, Sony Music Publishing, Warner Chappell, Kobalt, BMG, and more.</p>
<p>Snapchat has been looking to compete with TikTok, which has popularized short-form video sharing with posts set to music from a large catalog. For Snapchat, giving users access to different sounds is an important part of its efforts to compete with TikTok. Last year, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/snapchat-launches-its-tiktok-rival-sounds-on-snapchat/">Sounds</a>, a music-powered feature that allows users to set their Snaps to music. Snap says that since launching Sounds, videos created with music from Sounds have resulted in 521 million videos created and 31 billion views, the company said.</p>
<p>But Sounds aren&#8217;t just used to help fuel Snap&#8217;s TikTok competitor. Since Sounds&#8217; launch, nearly 45% of all Snapchat videos created with Sounds (across sends, posts, and saves) were sent via direct message.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new catalog of NBCU Sounds will be made available to Snapchat users globally, across iOS and Android.</p>

		An art historian by training, Michael Maizels is a multidisciplinary researcher working at the intersection of creativity, technology and economics. His next book, a new study on business model evolution in postwar art history, will be out in 2021.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I am an art historian who has carried out extensive research on the evolution of the market for “recent art.” And I can tell you that something generational is now happening with NFTs.</p>
<p>As a historian, this is quite exciting — almost the equivalent of an astronomer getting to watch the birth of a new galaxy. The multimillion-dollar results achieved by Cryptopunks, Bored Ape and Beeple have shattered long precedents in the history of art auctions and suggest that we may be nearing some tectonic tipping point around digital culture and virtual currency.</p>
<p>That tipping point may be inevitable in the century to come, but the fate of today’s most visible figures is remarkably uncertain. Having studied several of these cycles up close, I can say with some confidence that the factors that have determined whether art trends become art history are receiving scant attention amid the NFT writing of today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225953" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Namely, the movements that have held their long-term critical esteem (as well as market value) are those who have managed to attach themselves to the institutions, such as museums and universities, that both distill prestige and create knowledge.</p>
<p>Said differently, how will the world of NFT.NYC, taking place now in Times Square, relate not only to Sotheby’s downtown, but uptown — to MoMA? Or to Columbia University’s Department of Art History and Archaeology, widely considered the preeminent modern and contemporary program in the world?</p>
<p>The NFT world may collectively decide to sidestep these questions. No one would think of looking to the Golden Globes or the NYU film school to arbitrate the value of TikTok virality.</p>
<p>However, I’m skeptical that no serious attempt will be made to cultivate NFT worth for the long haul. There’s just too much at stake for the multibillion-dollar ecosystem of today not to attempt to organize and sort itself out. Gatekeepers and tastemakers arise organically, and powerful ones already exist in the $60 billion art market that predates the NFT universe by hundreds of years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, the relationships between artists, collectors, curators and academics have formed the fault lines around which art history has broken over the last centuries — sorting winners from losers, visionaries from imitators, priceless heritage from passing fancy. And I am certain that, for the NFT world, this intersection of intellectual and financial value has the potential to matter a lot. More than almost anyone realizes.</p>
<p>Probably the closest art historical analog to the present NFT fervor was the dramatic rise of pop art in the early 1960s. Artists such as Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol turned suddenly and in earnest to colorful, recognizable imagery produced in technological, déclassé media in multiple such as screen prints and lithographs.</p>
<p>Intentionally or not, this created an unprecedented volume of stuff to sell to the nouveau riche who had been locked out of the Old Master circuit. Fifty soup cans support a lot more market action than one Vermeer.</p>
<p>Gross market value aside, the durability of the success of Johns and Warhol is due in no small part to the efforts of a dealer named Leo Castelli, arguably the most impactful character of modern art history whose name is not widely known beyond the discipline.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/leo-castelli-archive-moma-contemporary-art-market-1202667829/">My research</a> uncovered how Castelli zealously worked to ensure that his coterie would end up on the walls of museums and as the subjects of academic monographs, endeavors that required him to occasionally flout ethical and legal norms. Importantly, his efforts broke through for a wave of new significant voices: not just the first young Americans to cross the threshold to canonization, but many of the first openly queer figures, as well. It rarely permits coloring within the lines, but writing history in real time can open the door to necessary change.</p>
<p>Pop’s priming of the museum ecosystem stands in marked contrast to a more recent episode of democratization. The “return to painting” of the 1980s presaged the NFTs’ auction-fueled dynamics as dealer Mary Boone and Sotheby’s CEO Alfred Taubman pioneered techniques akin to futures trading and margin buying — the last major innovations in the art auction space before the blockchain. They effectively poured gasoline on the fire of the secondary market but, without significant attention to an academic or institutional matrix to support the work, the overnight sensations they hyped mostly faded into oblivion.</p>
<p>These things will matter deeply in the long run. As years stretch into decades and centuries, cryptocurrency usage will almost inevitably grow. Nearly every interaction on the planet today is technologically mediated in some way, and the currency of record is ever more likely to become that which is native to the medium. This long-term potential provides a huge opportunity to rethink not just the expressive capabilities of the NFT but the fundamental means of academic knowledge creation.</p>
<p>An incredibly rich set of potential lurks here, made all the more pressing given the unfolding waves of crisis in higher education. Imagine a political scientist gaining a chance to tinker with an experimental voting mechanic as a part of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Or a historian working to close the gaps in an archival record through artistic re-imaginings.</p>
<p>Out of far-flung research, world-changing discoveries are sometimes forged. Voting mechanics might move from experimental margin to governmental center — perhaps finally unblocking comprehensive climate reform or other blue-sky legislative needs. The NFT world in which these ideas were incubated would have, through its collaboration with the academy, created something of deep significance. Something worthy of museum preservation (and market valuation) as an artifact of history.</p>
<p>At the present moment, open possibilities linger in the decentralized ether. How will practice be turned into history, ideally with the best net effect for society at large?</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Netflix sees gaming as a big part of its future in the battle for consumer attention. In July, the company hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-verdu-2a6113/">Mike Verdu</a> to head a new gaming division, signaling just how serious it is about moving into this new territory.</p>
<p>Verdu has a lot of gaming cred. He most recently served as vice president of augmented reality and virtual reality content at Facebook, and he was also the former head of Electronic Arts’ mobile gaming division. He has had stints at other game developers including Zynga, Kabam, Atari and Legend Entertainment, and he was a game developer himself. In short, Verdu knows this world inside and out, which is a good thing because his decisions could have a profound impact on the future of game development.</p>
<p>Verdu recently hinted at the company’s future plans. On September 28, Netflix announced its acquisition of <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/expanding-our-games-team-with-the-acquisition-of-night-school-studio">Night School Studio</a>, bringing some developer talent in house. It’s also been speculated that Netflix will pursue licensing deals with other gaming studios to quickly grow its offerings.</p>
<p>It makes one wonder how Netflix’s plans will influence game developers and studios around the world. More importantly, how will developers respond to Netflix’s entry into the space?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			There will likely be some fallout over the next few years as Netflix finds its footing, but ultimately, the company&#8217;s move into gaming will push game development further.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Options: A model shakeup</h2>
<p>Netflix’s existing audience of over 209 million subscribers translates into a lot of free marketing impressions and low player acquisition costs, giving it an immediate advantage over small studios and independent game developers who often struggle to gain attention for their games. Additionally, Netflix’s gaming division could spell trouble for the huge numbers of mobile game developers who rely on in-app purchases or advertising to make money — Netflix’s subscription model means it controls the user experience and doesn’t have to rely on ads or in-app purchases for its revenue stream.</p>
<p>At first blush, this could seem like a terrible blow to game developers, but it also opens new opportunities. If Netflix starts to gain traction in the gaming market (still a big <em>if</em>), developers will be spurred to innovate to stay a step ahead. This could be in terms of how games are designed and marketed, the actual player experience or how they are monetized. Innovation is good and necessary if developers want to continue attracting players.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say we could see some new models and experiences entering the gaming landscape. Netflix’s move into gaming is an inflection point, as it validates the work that developers have done thus far in capturing the mindshare of billions of players throughout the world. Gaming has gone mainstream, and Netflix will likely force it to evolve even more. This could be the moment gaming grows up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to Facebook AI Research, the next generation of robots should be much better at feeling — not emotions, of course, but using the sense of touch. And to advance the ball in this relatively new area of AI and robotics research, the company and its partners have built a <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/reskin-a-versatile-replaceable-low-cost-skin-for-ai-research-on-tactile-perception">new kind of electronic skin</a> and fingertip that are inexpensive, durable, and provide a basic and reliable tactile sense to our mechanical friends.</p>
<p>The question of why exactly Facebook is looking into robot skin is obvious enough that AI head Yann LeCun took it on preemptively on a media call showing off the new projects.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, he recalled, it started with Zuckerberg noting that the company seemed to have no good reason to be looking into robotics. LeCun seems to have taken this as a challenge and started looking into it, but a clear answer emerged in time: if Facebook was to be in the business of providing intelligent agents — and what self-respecting tech corporation isn&#8217;t? — then those agents need to understand the world beyond the output of a camera or microphone.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226125" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The sense of touch isn&#8217;t much good at telling whether something is a picture of a cat or a dog, or who in a room is speaking, but if robots or AIs plan to interact with the real world, they need more than that.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve become good at is understanding pixels and appearances,&#8221; said FAIR research scientist Roberto Calandra, &#8220;But understanding the world goes beyond that. We need to go towards a physical understanding of objects to ground this.&#8221;</p>
<p>While cameras and microphones are cheap and there are lots of tools for efficiently processing that data, the same can&#8217;t be said for touch. Sophisticated pressure sensors simply aren&#8217;t popular consumer products, and so any useful ones tend to stay in labs and industrial settings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DIGIT was released in 2020 as an open source design; it uses a tiny camera pointed at the pads to produce a detailed image of the item being touched. You can see the fingertips themselves in the image at top; it&#8217;s quite sensitive, as you can see from the detailed maps it&#8217;s able to create when touching various items:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226539" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226539" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2226539" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg" alt="Objects shown above images of the signals produced by the robotic fingertip." width="1024" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg 1818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=300,103 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=768,263 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=680,233 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=1536,526 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DIGIT_collage.jpeg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2226539" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>The ReSkin project has roots dating back to 2009; we wrote about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/19/a-unique-fingertip-sensor-helps-robots-touch-the-world-around-them/">MIT project called GelSight in 2014</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/mit-creates-a-soft-fingered-robotic-gripper-than-could-eventually-tie-knots-and-sew-stitches/">then again in 2020</a> — the company has spun out and is now the manufacturing partner for this well-documented approach to touch. Basically you have magnetic particles suspended in a soft gel surface, and a magnetometer beneath it can sense the displacement of those particles, translating those movements into accurate force maps of the pressures causing the movement.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the GelSight type system is that the hard component — the chip with the magnetometer and logic and so on — is totally separate from the soft component, which is just a flexible pad impregnated with magnetic dots. That means the surface can get dirty or scratched and is easily replaced, while the sensitive part can hide safely below.</p>
<p>In the case of ReSkin, it means you can hook a bunch of the chips up in any shape and lay a slab of magnetic elastomer on top, then integrate the signals and you&#8217;ll get touch information from the whole thing. Well&#8230; it&#8217;s not quite that simple, since you have to calibrate it and all, but it&#8217;s a lot simpler than other artificial skin systems that were possible to operate at scales beyond a couple square inches.</p>
<p>You can even make it into little dog shoes, because why not?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226536" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ReSkin-dog-shoe.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226536" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2226536" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ReSkin-dog-shoe.gif" alt="Animated image of a dog with pressure-sensing pads on its feet and the readings from them." width="768" height="432" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2226536" class="wp-caption-text">Animated image of a good dog with pressure-sensing pads on its feet and the readings from them.</p></div></p>
<p>With a pressure-sensitive surface like this, robots and other devices can more easily sense the presence of objects and obstacles, without relying on, say, extra friction from the joint exerting force in that direction. This could make assistive robots much more gentle and responsive to touch — not that there are many assistive robots out there to begin with. But part of the reason why is because they can&#8217;t be trusted not to crush things or people, since they don&#8217;t have a good sense of touch!</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s work here isn&#8217;t about new ideas, but about making an effective approach more accessible and affordable. The software framework will be released publicly and the devices can be bought for fairly cheap, so it will be easier for other researchers to get into the field.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Project Kuiper, Amazon&#8217;s satellite internet program, is aiming to launch two prototype satellites by the end of next year as it seeks to provide global broadband access to rural and remote areas.</p>
<p>The launch and operation of the prototypes first must be approved by the Federal Communications Commission; Kuiper Systems, the Amazon subsidiary that will operate Project Kuiper, filed what’s known as a “request for experimental license” with the regulator on Monday.</p>
<p>The goal would be to test and validate the satellites’ propulsion, power and attitude control systems, thermal design, and over-the-air software update capabilities. Kuiper Systems, which requested a two-year license, would also collect data on performance and telemetry over time, as well as data on the launch operations and mission management.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227062" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The two satellites would operate at 590 kilometers above Earth’s surface, one of three orbital altitudes the FCC licensed for use by Kuiper last year. Under that license, Amazon must send up around half its planned total constellation (which clocks in at 3,236 satellites) within the next six years.</p>
<p>Once in orbit, the satellites would link up to ground stations in South America, Asia, Texas, and four <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/amazons-project-kuiper-has-developed-a-small-low-cost-customer-terminal-for-its-broadband-satellite-network/">customer terminal units</a>, according to the company’s experimental license application. The company didn’t provide any more details about the customer units in the application, only noting that they would be the prototype of “an innovative, low-cost customer terminal developed by Amazon.”</p>
<p>The company said it would perform a “propulsive de-orbit” at the end of the mission, meaning the satellites would burn up the Earth’s atmosphere at the end of their useful life. Should that process fail, Project Kuiper said the satellites would passively de-orbit via orbital decay three-and-a-half years from launch.</p>
<p>Assuming the license is approved, the two prototypes &#8212; dubbed KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 &#8212; would launch from Cape Canaveral in two separate missions by the fourth quarter of 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon has selected ABL Space Systems as the launch provider for the two missions. While ABL&#8217;s RS1 rocket has yet to reach orbit, the startup said it plans to conduct its first launch of the 88-foot-tall rocket from Alaska by the end of this year. Last week, ABL announced it had closed a $200 million financing round, which reportedly boosted its valuation up to $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>The two companies have been working together &#8220;for several months,&#8221; Amazon said, with two integration design reviews already completed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see this as just the start of a long-term relationship together and look forward to supporting them as they expand their business,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The two prototypes are a crucial steppingstone to commercialization, as Amazon seeks to compete in the burgeoning satellite broadband market that’s currently cornered by SpaceX’s Starlink. That market could generate up to $18.6 billion by 2030, according to Allied Market Research.</p>
<p>Amazon plans to invest at least $10 billion in Project Kuiper. The ecommerce giant said last April it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/amazon-taps-ula-as-first-launch-provider-for-project-kuiper-satellite-constellation/">secured an agreement with United Launch Alliance</a> for nine launches. Amazon SVP of Devices &amp; Services <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/amazons-project-kuiper-will-seek-multiple-launch-providers-to-carry-its-satellites-to-space/">David Limp said during last year&#8217;s TC Sessions: Space</a> that the company will seek multiple launch providers for the project.</p>
<p>“When you have to put 3,200-plus things into space, you will need lots of launch capacity,” he said. “Our hope is that it’s not just one provider, that there will be multiple providers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp will today begin beta testing a new, cloud-based version of its <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp">WhatsApp Business API</a>, hosted on parent company Facebook&#8217;s infrastructure. With the shift to the cloud, the setup time for integrating with the API will drop from weeks to only minutes, the company claims, so businesses can more quickly transition to WhatsApp&#8217;s API platform to communicate with their customers who have opted in to receive their messages.</p>
<p>The company has been steadily building out its Business API over the past couple of years to become one of the key ways the otherwise free messaging app will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/whatsapp-business-api/">generate revenue from its service</a>. Businesses today pay WhatsApp on a per-message basis, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing#usd">with rates that vary</a> based on the number of messages sent and region. Currently, tens of thousands of larger businesses have adopted the existing (non-cloud based) API, including brands like Vodafone, Coppel, Sears Mexico, BMW, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Iberia Airlines, Itau Brazil, iFood, and Bank Mandiri, among others.</p>
<p>This older version of the API will continue to be supported and WhatsApp doesn&#8217;t have any current plans to force them to shift over to the new cloud-based version at this time. Both APIs are free to use.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226987" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Generally, businesses using the WhatsApp Business API will work with a solutions provider like Zendesk or Twilio, who help facilitate integrating the API with the customer&#8217;s backend systems. In these cases, WhatsApp is often just one part of the company&#8217;s customer communications strategy. They may also direct communications with customers to other channels, like SMS or other messaging apps, email, and more. But this API integration process, historically, has taken time &#8212; even as long as several weeks, or potentially, even a month.</p>
<p>With the pandemic having accelerated a shift to online shopping that was already underway before Covid, many companies don&#8217;t want to wait that long when getting up and running on new systems.</p>
<p>The new cloud-based API aims to simplify things on that front by offering a much easier, and therefore faster, technical integration process.</p>
<p>Initially, beta testers for the new API will include a couple dozen of WhatsApp&#8217;s existing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/partner-directory/search?solution_type=messaging&amp;platforms=whatsapp">solution provider partners</a>, such as Zendesk in the U.S., Take in Brazil, and MessageBird in the E.U.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Cloud API is a big step in reducing the complexity of using WhatsApp for both service providers like us and our customers,&#8221; noted Zendesk VP of Product, Mike Gozzo, in a statement. &#8220;Not needing to worry about hosting WhatsApp Clients will allow us to better focus on supporting the many rich features available via the API,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The launch comes at a time when the way people connect with businesses is changing. Today, over 175 million WhatsApp users message a business every day, and this trend is growing &#8212; particularly in non-U.S. markets like India, Brazil, and Indonesia, WhatsApp notes. More broadly, WhatsApp is seeing demand from consumers in shifting to messaging instead of using 1-800 numbers where they have to navigate phone systems and be placed on hold. This is annoying for customers. And call centers can be expensive for the businesses to operate, too.</p>
<p>WhatsApp&#8217;s own survey, conducted last year, indicates a preference among its users for messaging over calls. It found that 75% of users in some of its largest countries said they wanted to be able to communicate with businesses through messaging. And 68% said they were &#8220;more likely&#8221; to do business or make a purchase from a business that they were able to contact via messaging.</p>
<p>WhatsApp has been taking advantage of this trend in another way, as well. Its other significant revenue stream involves click-to-chat ads that pop up on Facebook&#8217;s News Feed or in Instagram, which offer consumers a way to send a message to a business on WhatsApp with a click of a button.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company addresses the small business market with its WhatsApp Business App, which allows local shops, like mom-and-pops, to get online to reach customers. It&#8217;s now grown to 50 million users globally f<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/whatsapp-officially-launches-its-app-for-businesses-in-select-markets/">ollowing its 2018 launch</a>.</p>
<p>Before today&#8217;s Cloud API launch, WhatsApp had been working on other<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-doubles-down-on-business-tools-with-whatsapp-api-updates-login-connect-for-messenger-and-more/"> API improvements</a>. These included giving businesses the ability to more quickly respond to inbound messages and support for different types of messages, like out-of-stock alerts, for consumers who opted in. (Before, WhatsApp&#8217;s API was focused on &#8220;timely&#8221; notifications &#8212; like sending out a boarding pass for a flight, for instance.)</p>
<p>The company says customers who receive communications from businesses will see an informational message at the top of their conversation that will inform them that <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/faq/">this is a different experience</a> than messaging with friends or family (which is fully encrypted). Customers can also choose to end communications in a number of ways, depending on what the business supports. They may be able to opt-out by just texting the business to stop or visit the company&#8217;s website to make a change. But the easiest way may be just to block the business in the app.</p>
<p>The Cloud API is arriving in a limited beta starting today with select partners who will be onboarding their first clients in the days ahead.</p>
<p>However, WhatsApp plans to open up the API to other solution providers and to businesses directly starting in 2022.</p>
<p><em><small>Correction, 11/2/21; 2pm et: The API currently has tens, not hundreds, of thousands of customers. We&#8217;ve updated with the correct information. </small></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canalys reported today that <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-pc-market-q3-2021?ctid=2427-02db49b9cb532b1f918f69dad9d76847">worldwide PC sales fell 2%</a> in the third quarter, but perhaps the most startling data point in the latest PC market survey was that Chromebooks sales were cut in half from 18% of total sales last quarter to just 9% this one.</p>
<p>The good news for the market in general was that with over 122 million units moving in the quarter, these numbers were still above pre-pandemic levels, but there are some storm clouds on the horizon as overall supply chain issues could complicate things for PC manufacturers in the coming quarters.</p>
<p>Overall Chromebook sales were down 37% year-over-year as the pandemic-induced sales frenzy finally slowed down with 5.3 million units being sold. The Chromebook numbers reflected the doldrums in sales with top Chromebook retailers taking huge hits. The top vendor Lenovo was down over 20% year-over-year, while HP in second place lost a whopping 66% and Acer in third place was down over 28%.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227009" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Canalys speculated this had more to do with market saturation than parts shortages or other supply chain issues. &#8220;The Chromebook market was hit by a massive downturn, with a 37% year-on-year fall in shipments (52% quarter on quarter) in Q3. This comes as major education markets such as the US and Japan reach saturation point, with public sector funding of digital education programs slowing,&#8221; according to the firm.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227036" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227036" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2227036" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/UdpLfCLW347373lKltPNclEOk0yK8nEh.jpeg?w=680" alt="Graph showing overall PC sales and Chromebooks as a percentage of those sales.

<p>Meanwhile tablet shipments dropped 15% year-over-year with sales down in every region except Asia-Pacific, which bucked the trend with sales up 23%. Compare that with North America where sales were down 24%.</p>
<p>Apple held onto the tablet market share lead with 40% of the market, up from 34.4% in the year-ago time period, but it wasn&#8217;t as good as it sounds as they sold almost exactly the same number of units as last year, meaning they had 0% growth. Samsung market share was down a tick from 20.4% a year ago to 19.1% this quarter, but sales dropped steeply, down over 20% over last year. Lenovo came in third with 11.3% share, up from 9.5% a year ago, and good for modest 2% growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overall PC sales told a bit better story with top vendor Lenovo up 4.1%, Apple in second up 4.6% and HP coming in third in the negative column down 5.7% with the company especially hard hit by the drop in Chromebook sales.</p>
<p>Brian Lynch, a research analyst at Canalys says that holiday shopping season may bring some relief in spite of supply chain issues. &#8220;Sales will improve in Q4 QoQ despite supply chain issues, largely due to holiday related consumer demand around the world. This will come via lower cost, less material-intensive devices. Consumers tend to buy less powerful devices putting a lesser strain on component manufacturers,&#8221; Lynch told TechCrunch. That said, the firm expects relatively static performance in Q4 in terms of YoY growth, and then marginal, steady growth in 2022 and the years following.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Canalys counts sales into the channel, rather than sales to end customers for its market survey methodology. That means it&#8217;s counting units it sold to a company like Best Buy or Staples, rather than to a consumer end user.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earbuds should be easy to review. Compared to the myriad other product categories we look at day in, day out, there aren’t that many variables. Do they sound good? How’s the battery life? What about the noise canceling? How do they fit?</p>
<p>That last bit is, of course, highly subjective &#8212; even more so than the others. And it points to one of the biggest issues with reviewing the products. Much like the music we listen to on them, preference is a deeply personal thing. These are products we often wear for hours at a time, intimately pressed against our ears while we work, travel, exercise and even sleep.</p>
<p>As I’ve often written, I’ve never seen a consumer electronics category develop as quickly as Bluetooth earbuds, going from novelty to commodity seemingly overnight. The truth is that most of them are pretty good.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226098" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As a rule, I often tell people to go with a pair from the company that made their phone. There’s something to be said for a pair of products that were effectively built to work together. That’s a good place to start, certainly. But there are plenty of other variables worth considering when buying a set of buds for yourself &#8212; or as gift this holiday season. Sound, price, comfort, design and size are all worth considering here.</p>
<p>Over the past year, I’ve reviewed more wireless earbuds than any other product category (by a fairly wide margin). There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution among them &#8212; and probably never will be in this space. What follows are some of my favorites in this burgeoning and booming category. You can’t go too wrong with any of them.</p>
<h3>Apple AirPods Pro</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1905294" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1905294" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1905294" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg" alt="Airpods Pro" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg 3008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=1536,1021 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSCF8442.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1905294" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Price: $249<br />
Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/apples-airpods-pro-set-a-pricey-new-standard-for-earbuds/">Apple’s AirPods Pro set a pricey new standard for earbuds</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having just celebrated their third anniversary, Apple’s pro-level buds are a bit long in the tooth. But in terms of the overall package, they’re still the ones to beat. Sure, the company just introduced the third generation of the standard buds, with new features that blurred the line between models, but pricing aside, the Pros are still superior in most ways. That is, unless you’ve got an aversion to silicone tips.</p>
<p>They sound great, are comfortable, have excellent noise canceling and work seamlessly with iOS devices.</p>
<h3>Beats Fit Pro</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2224326" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224326" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2224326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0656.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Price: $199<br />
Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/beats-fit-pro-review-ahead-of-the-pack/">Ahead of the Pack</a></p>
<p>Until today, I would point to the Powerbeats Pro anytime someone asked me for a good pair of workout headphones. And while the Fit Pro don’t replace that product outright, they’ve moved to the top of my list for the category. As someone who recently took up running again, I’m impressed with what Beats was able to do in such a small category. I’ve had an aversion to stability wings after testing some rigid and painful models in the past, but the company got things right here.</p>
<h3>OnePlus Buds Pro</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2189197" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189197" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189197" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9962.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Price: $150<br />
Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/oneplus-buds-pro-review-much-better/">Much Better</a></p>
<p>After striking out with their first pair of buds, OnePlus got a lot more things right with the Pros. They’re not setting the world on fire with any sort of tech innovation here, but they’re a solid and well-rounded pair that won’t require you to take out a second mortgage. The Pros have good noise canceling, are comfortable and, bonus, pump meditative white noise into your ears with a squeeze of the stems.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy Buds 2</h3>

Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-getting-out-of-their-own-way/">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2</a></p>
<p>Unlike the rest of the Galaxy line, Samsung’s Buds aren’t flashy. And, honestly, that’s fine. They’re compact, solid and get the job done. Like the OnePlus Buds Pro, they’re not pushing any boundaries, but they’re an excellent pair of $150 buds, with adaptive noise canceling. They play particularly well with other Samsung devices, so if you’re in the Galaxy ecosystem, these are probably the ones to get.</p>
<h3>Sony WF-1000XM4</h3>

Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/sony-sets-a-new-standard-with-the-wf-1000xm4-earbuds/">Sony sets a new standard with the WF-1000XM4 earbuds</a></p>
<p>Not for the faint of heart &#8212; or wallet &#8212; Sony returned with another set of truly excellent audiophile earbuds this year. They tend toward the bigger and bulkier side of things, so I wouldn’t recommend going for a run in them, but if you’re looking for a pair of buds to, say, enjoy the hell out of a great live jazz record, these are truly tough to beat. Along with their predecessors, the WF-1000XM3 and confusingly similarly named WH-1000XM3/4 over-ear phones, Sony continues to be the gold standard for great-sounding headphones.</p>
<h2>Wildcards:</h2>
<h3>Nothing Ear (1)</h3>

Review:<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/nothing-ear-1-review/"> Something interesting</a></p>
<p>Honorable mentions for a pair of wildcards/underdogs for those looking outside of the big cos. Nothing made a well constructed pair of buds at a good price. They also look the part, with a clever, semi-transparent design language. I had some connectivity issues early on, though the company has largely addressed that with subsequent firmware upgrades. If you&#8217;re looking for something outside the Apple/Samsung/Sony world that won’t break the bank, give these a look.</p>

Review: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/nura-finally-goes-fully-wireless-with-the-nuratrue-buds/">The hardware startup adapts its innovative sound tech for truly wireless earbuds</a></p>
<p>Nura adapted its clever sound-adapting technology into a pair of portable buds. They lack some of the immersive depth of their over-ear counterparts, but the company is able to create a truly impressive musical experience with its custom profiles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I<span style="font-weight: 400;">f you think manufacturing, assembling and servicing highly complex equipment on Earth is challenging, try doing it in space. On-orbit operations and servicing are vital emerging technologies, and you’ll have ample opportunity to improve your understanding of them at</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Sessions: Space 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on December 14-15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a satellite breaks down, you can’t just call AAA. On-orbit servicing (OOS) enables inspections, repairs and technology upgrades for both military and commercial satellites — extending their service viability, reducing dangerous space debris and saving a galactic ton of money. Consider this: A military satellite in geostationary orbit can cost more than a billion dollars. Would you junk a billion-dollar car if you could fix it instead?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very high-tech version of reduce, reuse and recycle, on-orbit ops/services lead to orbital sustainability — a more efficient, affordable operating environment for both the public and private sectors. Plus, the ability to install new payloads, such as upgraded communication or navigation systems, to existing satellites supports their mission while, again, reducing costs and space clutter.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225173" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this isn’t our first foray into this category. Orbit Fab, who </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnyrgrGvXwU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched in Startup Battlefield</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Disrupt in 2019, is </span><a href="https://blog.executivebiz.com/2021/10/orbit-fab-afrl-enter-into-randd-agreement-to-develop-on-orbit-refueling-product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to advance on-orbit refueling technology. They also just raised $10 million from both VC and prime contractor investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Sessions: Space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year, we’ve tapped deeply experienced leaders in this field (from LeoLabs, Maxar and Astroscale) to share their expertise and discuss the current state of on-orbit ops.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Sessions: Space 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takes place on December 14-15. We’ve dedicated two full days to explore and gain more understanding of the rapidly advancing technologies and opportunities in space — from in-space propulsion systems and lunar sampling to investment trends and public-private collaboration.</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy your pass today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and get an insider’s look at on-orbit operations and servicing &#8212; and so much more.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon announced today that a TikTok app is <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/tiktok-now-available-on-amazon-fire-tv-in-u-s-and-canada-afc62bf2977d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now available</a> on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/amazon-fire-tv/">Amazon Fire TV</a> for users in the U.S. and Canada. The app is also coming soon to Echo Show devices.</p>
<p>After downloading TikTok from the Fire TV Appstore, users can log in to their TikTok account, or create one if they aren&#8217;t already one of the app&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">one billion monthly active users</a>. Then, like the mobile app, users can browse TikTok feeds like &#8220;following,&#8221; &#8220;for you&#8221; and the discover page. On the app itself, you have to manually scroll to view the next video clip, but the Fire TV app has autoplay, so you won&#8217;t have to press a button on your remote or tell Alexa to play the next video every few seconds (or minutes).</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time that you could watch vertically oriented short-form videos on the big screen &#8212; TikTok apps can already be used on <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-on-google-tv-and-android-tv-is-here" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google TV and Android TV</a>, as well as some <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/samsung-tiktok-app-for-smart-tvs-coming-soon-to-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung smart TVs</a>. But now that TikTok enables creators to upload videos up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/">three minutes long</a>, it might feel more natural to opt for big screen-viewing than it would if you were only watching 15-second videos, for instance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226980" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like TikTok&#8217;s update to support longer videos this summer, making its app accessible on TVs is yet another show of competition with YouTube, which created <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">YouTube Shorts </a>as a TikTok competitor earlier this year.</p>

<p>To support the creative process, Pinterest is also launching a virtual studio where producers will work with creators to help them develop their content and provide A/V support, so they can go live more easily.</p>
<p>The new episodes will begin airing starting on November 8, and will air Monday through Friday at 3 PM PDT / 6 PM EDT in the U.S. on the Pinterest iOS app to start. Each Friday, products will drop into a live shopping experience where Pinterest users will be offered discounts from participating brands, including Patagonia, All Birds, Crown Affair, Melody Ehsani, Outdoor Voices, Mented and others.</p>
<p>According to Pinterest&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LnTYC0wlmd-0WV587B8PGqzNLhIZg-1Xh7I79y8OsMw/viewform?edit_requested=true#response=ACYDBNgUy4RB_Sc7JuxYxDHrDZjASzsFlqr1HwHchvqz3jE2vAB5u-Ws0ZP4hxJhLQIiVdI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">call to action,</a> these shows will be 30 minutes in length and will include a 10-30 minute pre-production call with Pinterest&#8217;s team and AV tech check.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea, Pinterest explains, is to create a new way for its users to become inspired &#8212; instead of just browsing images for products and ideas, as before, Pinterest TV allows the company to move further into video and the creator economy.</p>
<p>This shift is a pivot Pinterest has been trying to make for many months. As new social networks like TikTok are becoming the place where younger, Gen Z users are discovering ideas which then translate into online shopping purchases, Pinterest&#8217;s image pinboard experience has started to feel dated &#8212; like a holdover from another era of the web. This is an issue facing other, older social networks, as well. Instagram&#8217;s head, for example, recently said its app<a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQwNfFBJr5A/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> would no longer be focused on photo sharing</a>, as it&#8217;s now embracing video.</p>
<p>Similarly, Pinterest has been working to make video more core to its platform. Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/">it introduced a TikTok-like &#8220;Watch&#8221; tab</a> where users can vertically scroll through a feed of creator&#8217;s videos, which they can like, comment on and save to their Pinterest boards. These videos are a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">newer type of content type which Pinterest calls &#8220;Idea Pins,</a>&#8221; a video-first feature that lets creators demonstrate some sort of idea or DIY &#8212; like cooking a recipe or doing a craft, for example.</p>
<p>To encourage creators to make videos, Pinterest is investing $20 million in Creator Rewards and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/pinterest-rolls-out-new-features-that-let-creators-make-money-from-pins/">offering other tools to allow them to monetize their content</a>, like those for enabling affiliate links, partnering with brands on sponsored content, product tagging and more.</p>
<p>However, most of what Pinterest has been doing on the video front so far has not been unique. Instead, it&#8217;s about a site playing catch-up with where the web is heading &#8212; toward creator-backed content, videos and live shopping experiences.</p>
<p>Pinterest TV is another example of this broader plan being put into action. And to be successful, Pinterest will need to be able to prove it&#8217;s worth creators&#8217; time and effort, given the competition among social platforms for creator talent &#8212; not to mention the large creator funds being offered by the likes of Facebook, Instagram, Snap and YouTube as they try to combat the TikTok threat.</p>
<p>So far, Pinterest says creators who’ve pilot tested Pinterest TV episodes were able to increase their followings, with some creators more than doubling their followers after a live episode. However, the company will still need to prove out that larger followings will translate to larger creator revenues over time. (At launch, Pinterest says it&#8217;s not directly profiting from Pinterest TV).</p>
<p>While Pinterest TV is only currently available to select creators, the company is offering<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LnTYC0wlmd-0WV587B8PGqzNLhIZg-1Xh7I79y8OsMw/viewform?edit_requested=true#response=ACYDBNgUy4RB_Sc7JuxYxDHrDZjASzsFlqr1HwHchvqz3jE2vAB5u-Ws0ZP4hxJhLQIiVdI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a sign-up form</a> for others who are interested in creating TV episodes through the new service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is rolling out a pilot program in the Netherlands that opens 10 Supercharger locations to non-Tesla electric vehicles for the first time.</p>
<p>Non-Tesla drivers that want to use a Supercharger location will first need to download the Tesla app and create an account with the company. From there, they can select &#8220;Charge Your Non-Tesla,&#8221; search for a location, add a payment method and start charging, according to information on Tesla&#8217;s Netherlands website.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Trial program for opening Tesla Superchargers to other EVs has begun <a href="https://t.co/g4HpgRGl7d">https://t.co/g4HpgRGl7d</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226956" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1455186850155479048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Drivers operating non-Tesla EVs will not have a totally seamless charging experience; while Tesla users can simply plug in and out, these drivers will have to indicate on the app when to start and stop the charging session. And while the price of electricity will stay the same for Tesla owners, non-Teslas will incur additional costs, including those “associated with charging a large number of different cars and made to make the locations suitable for cars from other brands,” the company said.</p>
<p>Only EVs with a CCS standard connection will be eligible to participate in the pilot. Here in the U.S., Tesla Superchargers use a proprietary connector, but CEO Elon Musk indicated in a second-quarter earnings call in July that an adapter could be sold or offered at the company’s North America charging locations, should the network open in the U.S. He also suggested that the company could implement dynamic pricing during busy periods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pilot will let Tesla “gain experience, monitor flow at the loaders and collect user feedback,” the company said on its website. Tesla is encouraging its drivers to continue using the 10 locations as normal, likely to ensure that it is getting good data on how its flagship users are affected. In the case of non-Teslas charging slower than Tesla vehicles, the pilot will also likely measure the impact of slower charging times on other users.</p>
<p>Musk has long indicated that such a program, which the company is calling the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/nl_NL/support/non-tesla-supercharging?&amp;redirect=no&amp;utm_source=notifications&amp;utm_medium=tesla_app&amp;utm_campaign=ntsc_pilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Non-Tesla’s Supercharger Pilot,”</a> might eventually be introduced. He confirmed in July that the network would open to non-Teslas by the end of this year, and this pilot appears to be just the beginning; the company said on its website that it will be adding additional countries to the program “in the near future.”</p>
<p>Tesla’s Supercharger network includes over 25,000 fast chargers, by far the largest network owned and operated by an automaker in the world.</p>
<p>“Our ambition has always been to open the Supercharger network to Non-Tesla electric cars in order to encourage more drivers to make the switch to electric driving,” Tesla said.</p>
<p>During the earnings call in July, Andrew Baglino, Tesla’s senior VP of powertrain and energy engineering, made the case that opening the Supercharger network to non-Teslas could result in lower electricity costs overall.</p>
<p>“Increasing the utilization of the network actually reduces our costs, which allows us to lower charging prices for our customers and make the network more profitable, allows us to grow the network faster,” he said. “And no matter what, we&#8217;re going to continue to aggressively expand the network capacity, increasing charging speeds, improving the trip planning tools to protect against site congestion using dynamic pricing, as Elon mentioned.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://octoml.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OctoML</a>, a Seattle-based startup that helps enterprises optimize and deploy their machine learning models, today announced that it has raised an $85 million Series C round led by Tiger Global Management. Previous investors <span style="font-weight: 400;">Addition, Madrona Venture Group and Amplify Partners also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $132 million, including a $28 million Series B round it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/octoml-raises-28m-series-b-for-its-machine-learning-acceleration-platform/">announced earlier this year</a>.</span></p>
<p>The company was co-founded by <span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Luis Ceze, CTO Tianqi Chen, CPO Jason Knight, Chief Architect Jared Roesch and VP of Technology Partnerships Thierry Moreau, who together also created the <a href="https://tvm.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apache TVM</a> open source machine learning compiler framework. TVM is currently in use by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. OctoML builds on TVM&#8217;s ability to automatically optimize machine learning models and allow them to run on virtually any hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ceze told me, since raising its Series A round, the company has signed up a number of hardware partners, including <a href="https://octoml.ai/blog/importance-of-our-qualcomm-partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualcomm</a>, AMD and Arm. The company also recently worked with Microsoft on a project about deploying <a href="https://octoml.ai/blog/with-apache-tvm-microsoft-research-runs-the-latest-computer-vision-algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video content moderation at scale</a>. The company says its users, which feature a number of Global 100 companies, including Toyota, are seeing a 2-10x improvement in their ML model performance after using its service.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226785" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpO4y1mPMWA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time of its Series B earlier this year, the company had just started onboarding some early adopters to its SaaS platform. As Ceze noted ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, that service hasn&#8217;t quite reached general availability yet, but OctoML is now working with a larger number of customers and is focused on making them successful on its platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As models proliferate and get more sophisticated, deploying them in the cloud is also getting more expensive, Ceze noted, so a system that can optimize these models immediately leads to cost savings for the company&#8217;s customers. &#8220;It&#8217;s not only a cost issue but also a sustainability issue,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;If you make something twice as fast on the same hardware, making use of half the energy, that has an impact at scale.&#8221; Increasingly, he noted, the large cloud providers also hit capacity limits for deploying high-end GPUs (there is a chip shortage, after all), so being able to move their models to a different GPU or maybe even to a CPU is another advantage.</span></p>
<p>Ceze noted that the company didn&#8217;t have to raise new funding at this point, but that the team decided to be opportunistic despite still having a healthy runway. &#8220;We looked at all of our opportunities in hardware enablement, in accelerating the SaaS business and cloud enablement. We were, &#8216;oh wow, so we can get even faster here and capture this business.&#8217; We have a business opportunity right in front of us, but we need to scale fast to take full advantage of it,&#8221; Ceze said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to quickly expand its team across various engineering and sales functions to take advantage of this opportunity as it brings on new customers. OctoML also plans to build out its partner ecosystem.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;OctoML is creating a profound shift in the way organizations build next-generation AI models and applications,&#8221; said Tiger Global partner John Curtius. &#8220;OctoML’s vision of delivering a unified deployment lifecycle for users across all the ML hardware vendors they rely on is making ML development more cost-effective and accessible to a broader set of developers. We’re excited to welcome Luis and the co-founding team at OctoML to the Tiger portfolio, and look forward to playing a role in their next growth chapter.&#8221;</span></p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://zendesk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zendesk</a> announced it was acquiring <a href="https://www.momentive.ai/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Momentive</a> Global Inc. (<a href="https://investor.zendesk.com/ir-home/financial-reports/financial-releases/financial-releases-details/2021/Zendesk-to-Acquire-Momentive-and-Its-Iconic-SurveyMonkey-Platform/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the organization behind SurveyMonkey</a>) for $4.13 billion last week, it might have felt like a steep price to pay, but it seems that companies are willing to pay a high price to understand what users and customers are thinking &#8212; and that&#8217;s what <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey</a> gives Zendesk.</p>
<p>Zendesk, whose core offering involves customer service, now has a way to get feedback on that service and collect valuable data about the interactions. In fact, company CEO and founder Mikkel Svane says it&#8217;s all about using that data to create a customer intelligence platform. &#8220;We will deliver a rich, colorful picture of every customer so businesses really understand their customers and can build more authentic relationships,&#8221; Svane said in a statement.</p>
<p>Laurie McCabe, co-founder and analyst at SMB Group, says the deal makes sense in the context of finding a way to get a better grip on customer attitudes. &#8220;Momentive gives Zendesk a proven, easy-to-use survey tool to provide its customers with another avenue to learn more about their customers’ attitudes and requirements, not just now, but in the future,&#8221; she said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226929" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;If they can make it easy to access and analyze blended data from these two platforms, it should provide their customers with a more complete view of individual customers and overall market trends,&#8221; she said. And understanding the customer experience should help improve and refine it when need be.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says the ability to collect data and build a more complete picture of the customer is becoming increasingly essential to companies like Zendesk. &#8220;The current [thinking] is that you need survey tools to understand what customers, employees, etc. are thinking and feeling. And that&#8217;s why Zendesk bought Momentive. If you don&#8217;t have the data you need, start a survey,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says that it might be tempting to compare this to the $8 billion 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">SAP-Qualtrics deal</a>, but he says while they have overlap, Qualtrics is a far more sophisticated platform, as shown by its market cap today of almost $24 billion, compared to Momentive&#8217;s $4.1 billion purchase price. &#8220;Qualtrics is better understood as being an analytics platform with deep and broad capabilities beyond surveys, which is why its valuation is what it is today,&#8221; Leary explained.</p>
<p>For some perspective, both companies reported earnings last Thursday, with Zendesk reporting $347 million in revenue up 32% YoY for a $1.38 billion run rate. Meanwhile, Momentive reported $109.4 million in revenue, up 24% YoY, putting it on a $437.6 million run rate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From a financial standpoint, the company said that adding Momentive will push it to $3.5 billion in revenue a year ahead of schedule (in 2024) and it&#8217;s anticipating that revenue will reach $4.5 billion by 2025, according to <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/911660223/files/doc_presentations/2021/ZEN-MNTV-Transaction-Deck-10-28-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a company presentation</a> about the deal.</p>
<p>The stock market was not kind to either company after the deal was announced last Thursday. When the market closed on Friday, Zendesk was down almost 15% and Momentive down over 8%. Zendesk is still down a bit this morning in early trading, while Momentive is up slightly.</p>
<p>In addition to SurveyMonkey, Momentive also includes a custom mobile survey tool called <a href="https://www.getfeedback.com/en/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetFeedback</a> and a market research arm that is part of the parent company.</p>
<p>Both companies&#8217; boards have already approved the deal. It will still need to be approved by the stockholders at both organizations, who if the initial reaction of the market is any indication, might need to be convinced. In addition, the deal will be subject to standard regulatory oversight. If it makes past these hurdles, it is expected to close some time in the first half of next year. Momentive CEO Zander Laurie will remain with the combined company after the close.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Google suffered a major defeat in its legal battle with Sonos in August, when a U.S. International Trade Commission judge ruled that Google infringed on five of Sonos&#8217; audio technology patents. If the ruling is upheld, Google could pay <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/big-tech-apple-google-optis-sonos-legal-battles-over-patents-2021-8?mkt_tok=ODUwLVRBQS01MTEAAAF-8utVWcT5kjyev2UB_LaOp5OuoOpv5hKM_-AsApGr57bJBrj28zod4Vj2Mvn2fl5RnGfD0KKA_MCfoWTmClHOe10fMd1x8aNlAqBrZ6m_NPk">hundreds of millions</a> and face a ban on importing everything from Pixel smartphones to Nest speakers.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a trivial development. It&#8217;s the latest in a string of lawsuits and complaints intended to stop Big Tech from pilfering IP from smaller companies.</p>
<p>In recent years, Big Tech firms have increasingly infringed on smaller rivals&#8217; IP. Those smaller firms have started fighting back &#8212; and now the largest tech companies could face tens of billions in court-ordered damages and legal fees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224303" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If Big Tech executives continue their reckless infringement, their firms could suffer irreparable financial and reputational damage. Stealing rivals&#8217; IP is no longer merely unethical &#8212; it&#8217;s a business decision so disastrously shortsighted that it arguably constitutes a breach of executives&#8217; fiduciary duties to shareholders.</p>
<p>For a long time, giant technology firms like Apple figured they could freely prey on smaller competitors, which wouldn&#8217;t have the financial or legal firepower to fight back. That&#8217;s no longer the case.</p>
<p>Small firms have decided suing is worth the cost &#8212; and have won big. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/11/apple-panoptis-lawsuit-506-million-lte-patents/">just</a> <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1366761/apple-hit-with-308-5m-verdict-in-edtx-patent-trial">three</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/30/apple-virnetx-503-million-patent-infringement/#:~:text=Apple%20Ordered%20to%20Pay%20VirnetX%20Another%20%24502.8%20Million%20for%20Patent%20Infringement,-Friday%20October%2030&amp;text=A%20jury%20today%20ruled%20that,of%20infringing%20on%20VirnetX%20patents">cases</a> this past year, juries awarded small firms more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/texas-distanced-juries-hit-big-tech-with-3-7-billion-of-awards">$1 billion</a>. In August, Apple was ordered to pay PanOptis <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/apple-hit-with-300-million-patent-verdict-after-new-optis-trial-2021-08-13/">$300 million</a> over 4G technology infringement. And last year, a court ordered the company to pay <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/15/apple-could-owe-1-1-billion-to-virnetx/">$1 billion</a> in damages to VirnetX, a VPN patent holder.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just Apple. Last October, a federal court ordered Cisco to pay nearly <a href="https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2020/10/09/centripetal-networks-awarded-1-9-billion-infringement-suit-cisco/id=126094/">$2 billion</a> to Centripetal Networks, a cybersecurity and software firm. The judge in that case called Cisco&#8217;s actions &#8220;an egregious case of willful misconduct beyond typical infringement.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>IP theft has the potential to put a significant dent into Big Tech&#8217;s bottom lines. Though these companies boast market capitalizations of hundreds of billions, even trillions, of dollars, racking up mammoth court-ordered payouts isn&#8217;t pleasant.</p>
<p>For example, Cisco&#8217;s payout cost it <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271853/worldwide-net-sales-of-cisco-systems-since-2006/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20Cisco's%20revenue%20amounted,and%20technology%20services%20and%20products">4%</a> of its annual revenue. Apple recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/texas-distanced-juries-hit-big-tech-with-3-7-billion-of-awards">settled</a> with a Japanese company rather than have to pay yet another billion dollars in damages. And it threatened to pull out of the United Kingdom entirely rather than face a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/11/apple-attorneys-threaten-uk-market-exit-if-court-orders-unacceptable-patent-fees">$7 billion</a> patent-infringement fee in the British courts.</p>
<p>Even if big firms can weather the financial penalties of their IP theft, the resulting reputational damage is considerable.</p>
<p>U.S. congressional committees regularly haul executives into their chambers for hearings about antitrust and privacy infractions. Consumers increasingly regard Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon with distaste &#8212; or worse. If politicians and customers learn these companies&#8217; profits rest on persistent patent theft, their reputations will take a pounding.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Big Tech executives have a legal fiduciary duty to their shareholders. Executives who continue to turn a blind eye to the risks involved with patent trials &#8212; exposing their firms to immense legal and reputational risk &#8212; will eventually find their morally questionable decisions reflected in share prices.</p>
<p>For their part, shareholders, rank-and-file employees and other stakeholders should hold executives to account. It&#8217;s in the interest of the biggest institutional investors to pressure Apple and others to settle pending cases and hash out licensing agreements with small vendors.</p>
<p>If Big Tech starts operating within the bounds of IP law, they&#8217;ll prime the entire sector for sustained success.</p>
<p>As Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto points out in his seminal work, “The Mystery of Capital,” a society&#8217;s economic prosperity is hugely dependent on its protection and preservation of property rights, including intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Societies with strong property rights protections encourage people to invest in their own ideas. Conversely, societies with weak property rights protections discourage such investment &#8212; and innovation is discouraged as well.</p>
<p>The U.S. tech sector is no exception. Consumers and shareholders should want both small and large firms to thrive. Smaller firms develop input software, applications and hardware that often ends up in consumer-facing products.</p>
<p>But when the big guys bully the little guys and pillage their best ideas without paying, the little guys have no incentive to innovate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for Big Tech to stop patent theft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder is bringing back &#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221; its interactive in-app event that allows its users another way to break the ice besides just matching and chatting. After the first season&#8217;s &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; apocalyptic storyline brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/tinders-interactive-swipe-night-stories-return-after-a-20-million-user-turnout/">over 20 million users</a>, Tinder said it would introduce a new installment, this time featuring a &#8220;whodunit&#8221; murder mystery. That event, &#8220;Swipe Night: Killer Weekend,&#8221; will kick off starting on November 7th at 6 PM, the company announced this morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; will go live in Tinder&#8217;s new Explore section, <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first introduced in June</a>, where the company will now house more of its social experiences. In addition to &#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221; this section also includes &#8220;Hot Takes,&#8221; which let members chat in real time in a sort of speed dating, timed experience, and &#8220;Passions,&#8221; where users can meet others with similar interests, among other things.</p>
<p>This time, Tinder has made some changes to how &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; will work. Instead of watching a story play out and then making choices as to what they should do next, the new event more directly involves Tinder users themselves, where they become a suspect in the murder mystery. Players will also be able to explore and search rooms within the house and investigate objects for clues.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226930" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the end of each week, participants are asked to choose their suspect and they&#8217;ll be paired with another user who chose a different suspect in a &#8220;Fast Chat&#8221; experience (where users can chat without matching), in order to discuss their thoughts, analyze clues and solve the mystery together. These pairings will be algorithmic, based on the user&#8217;s profile preferences where they&#8217;ve indicated who they&#8217;re looking for in terms of factors like age, gender, distance and others. But their choice of a different suspect is meant to help facilitate a conversation &#8212; something that&#8217;s been tricky on online dating apps, where users often struggle with opening lines.</p>
<p>When the conversation ends, players can choose to match with the other person if they want to continue to talk to them beyond the &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; experience.</p>
<p>The company believes this type of low-pressure chat will make it easier for users to test out their compatibility before matching and provides a better overall experience than sending a message to someone in the app, which they might not see until the next day. And by playing a game together, users may be able to be more authentic as they describe their thoughts and choices. This, Tinder argues, is a better way to get to know someone than making a snap decision over a user&#8217;s profile.</p>
<p>Plus, notes Tinder VP of Product Kyle Miller, this type of real-time chat is preferred by Tinder&#8217;s younger users, like Gen Z.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Demographically, we&#8217;re seeing Gen Z engage with these kinds of interactive, fun ways to meet new people features a lot more,&#8221; he explains.  &#8220;This is one of the big reasons why we built &#8216;Explore&#8217; &#8212; we wanted Tinder to feel alive, experiential and immersive&#8230;When you&#8217;re doing kind of the same pattern over and over again of swiping and matching and then chatting&#8230;it can become monotonous. Not what we desired,&#8221; Miller continues. &#8220;Injecting that kind of fun and novelty, but also substance, I think is what we&#8217;re finding Gen Z is really latching on to.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time, Tinder will also make &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; more broadly available, by launching it in 25 global markets, while the original version started off only in the U.S.</p>
<p>And it will be playable at any time, unlike the first season.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last time we did &#8216;Swipe Night,&#8217; it was pretty limited in its availability &#8212; Sundays, or only on the weekends,&#8221; says Miller. &#8220;This will be live in &#8216;Explore&#8217; and even after the season is out, it will continue to be available in &#8216;Explore.&#8217; Six months from now, you could actually participate in &#8216;Swipe Night&#8217; and, similar to streaming to today, you&#8217;ll be able to rewatch, or re-experience, the episodes to go back to find more clues.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also didn&#8217;t rule out a future where there&#8217;s a catalog of interactive experiences for users to participate in, at any time, even if they weren&#8217;t all versions of &#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221; necessarily.</p>
<p>These types of experiences, as they launch, could help Tinder increase user engagement over time, as well as provide better results for members. The first &#8220;Swipe Night&#8217;s&#8221; 20 million users saw a 26% increase in matches, noted Tinder. And now, interest in the &#8220;true crime&#8221; genre is at an all-time high, with bios mentioning it having increased by 20% since the year&#8217;s start. Over 30,000 Tinder bios say they&#8217;re looking for their &#8220;partner in crime,&#8221; as well.</p>
<p>This season of &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; is <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/news?item=122516" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tinderpressroom.com/news?item%3D122516&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635858754389000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0hDcpDhcuboY6v4T7Tja7B">directed by Sasie Sealy</a> and features a young, Gen Z cast that includes Ashley Ganger (Grand Army/Netflix), Calvin Seabrooks (Dollface/Hulu, Westworld/HBO Max), Luke Slattery (New Amsterdam, Late Night), Francesca Olivia Xuereb (Room 203, The Sex Lives of College Girls/HBO Max), Nozipho Mclean (The Inheritance, Are You Happy Now), Ivan Carlo (Gossip Girl/HBO Max) and Emile Ravenet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The thing that makes earbuds supremely difficult to review is that no two sets of ears are exactly the same. Heck, no two ears are exactly the same, period. As someone prone to pain using the wrong set for an extended period, I can appreciate the importance of finding the right pair.</p>
<p>When the Beats Fit Pro first leaked, I had my misgivings. Design-wise, they more or less look like the Studio Buds the Apple subsidiary released over the summer, with one major difference: wings. Wings, wingtips, eartips, fins, whatever you call them, I hate them. I respond viscerally to the sight of them, in fact &#8212; weird little pointed things you’re meant to jam into your ears.</p>
<p>Now, I admit that much of this is a holdover from testing workout headphones some years back. In those days, wings were, to a fault, hard plastic things that were every bit as pointed as they looked. And while I can appreciate from a stability standpoint how such a feature works during, say, a long run, I largely try to avoid putting pointy things in or near sensitive parts of my body &#8212; except when absolutely necessary.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225150" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>In spite of my initial hesitancy, I’m happy to report that my concerns were overblown. The Fit Pros are comfortable. Like surprisingly so. The buds themselves are fairly small, with the eartips adding wingspan to the design. They’re not unlike the Powerbeats Pro in that respect, but they’re able to accomplish their task with significantly less plastic. The key to the tips’ success is their size and shape and, equally important, the fact that the silicone they’re made from is malleable, meaning they keep things still without digging into the surrounding cartilage.</p>
<p>I’m going to stop short of calling them the most comfortable earbuds I’ve tested. Honestly, that distinction probably belongs to their older sibling, the Powerbeats Pro. While that design is big and somewhat unwieldly, the over-the-ear displaces the weight and pressure of the buds. And while the Fit Pros only weigh 11.2 grams, that can still wear on you after extended periods.</p>
<p>They also do an admirable job keeping things in place. I took up running again recently, and have been trying all sorts of earbuds (with limited success). When we think about keeping headphones in place while working out, we (I think understandably) tend to focus on physical movement. What we tend to ignore is how that combines with sweat, making it both difficult to keep the buds in place and hard to fumble to adjust them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The Fit Pro excelled there better than any other buds of recent vintage on this front. If you’re primarily looking for a pair of gym buds, these are hard to beat (so to speak). The wingtip meets the bud to form a physical button. It’s meant to be pressed at the edge furthest from the tip. Pressing in the middle will apply more pressure to your ear. A single press will play/pause/answer a call, double skips a track forward, three goes back and a long press toggles between ANC and transparency modes.</p>
<p>These sorts of physical buttons are necessary for workout headphones. Touch gets a bit tricky when you sweat. The biggest downside on this front is that the relatively small size does result in some accidental button presses if you need to adjust them while working out. But even so, they’re well ahead of most earbuds for this purpose. It’s also a nice change from Studio Buds, which I found extremely difficult to keep in place while going for a run.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the wingtip’s attachment to the button means it’s not removable or user-replaceable. That’s a bit of a bummer. It would be great to be able to take the tips off when a workout is over, though likely that would compromise their structural integrity &#8212; and it’s just another thing to possibly lose. But if the wingtip gets damaged, you’ll need to send the whole thing back (if under warranty). Apple/Beats isn’t selling that bit separately.</p>
<p>The sound is good here &#8212; pretty similar to what you get on other Beats. That is to say, it’s bass-heavy. If you’re looking for a pair of buds for, say, enjoying the subtle nuances of jazz, I’d recommend something from Sony. These are more “let’s toss on a pumped-up playlist and go for a run” headphones &#8212; and there’s certainly a place for that. Active noise canceling is excellent, as well. It did a good job blocking out ambient street noise and bad gym music, especially when I swapped in a large pair of silicone tips.</p>

<p>Being Apple-owned, it’s probably unsurprising that the buds work best with iOS devices. That’s due in large part to the inclusion of the H1 chip. In addition to fast paring and automatic device switching, you’ll get Find My functionality and Spatial Audio. That last bit, which is also available on various AirPods, uses headtracking to redirect the sound of audio. That means a more speaker-like experience for music listening and assigning the location of voices based on screen placement in FaceTime. I’ll be honest, it feels like a novelty for now. Android users, meanwhile, should download the Beats app for the full experience.</p>

<p>One of the unheralded upshots of moving from loops to wingtips is getting a significantly smaller charging case. The Powerbeats Pro’s case is a monster. The Fit Pro’s isn’t small by any stretch (it’s still significantly larger than the AirPods), but it’s actually small enough to carry around in a pocket. And thanks to some hardware advances, you actually get more combined battery on the Fit, at 27 hours versus 24. The buds themselves are rated at six to seven hours, depending on use. The case takes about 90 minutes for a full charge, doing so via USB-C &#8212; a distinct advantage for those of us who aren’t big Lightning fans. Points lost, however, for the exclusion of wireless chargin.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Fit Pros don’t actually replace any other member of the Beats family. Power Beats Pro, Studio Buds and all of the tethered units are sticking around. There’s a bit of redundancy here, but Beats has always played it a bit faster and loser than its parent company on that front.</p>
<p>At $199, they’re right between the Beats Studio and the Powerbeats Pro. But for most people in most cases (particularly those who work out frequently), they’re the best bet of the bunch. They go up for preorder today and start shipping November 5.</p>
