										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California might be the first state to give self-driving cars a deadline to electrify.</p>
<p>In mid-February, a bill was quietly introduced into the California State Legislature that would require all autonomous vehicles to also be zero emission by 2025. Proposed <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB500">Bill SB 500</a>, which was introduced by Senator Dave Min and sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), would directly affect the nascent AV industry in applications like ride-hailing, delivery and trucking.</p>
<p>The amendment is in line with many of California&#8217;s goals to reduce emissions. It would add to the state&#8217;s vehicle code, which currently provides for programs to promote zero-emission vehicles, such as the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project and the Charge Ahead California Initiative.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Governor Gavin Newsom has said he wants all new vehicle sales to be zero emission by 2035, but that doesn&#8217;t apply to commercial fleets. Not unless this bill is passed. The proposed bill is in its infancy stages, so there are plenty of opportunities for it to be quashed. But it surfaces an issue for a burgeoning AV industry and the companies trying to develop and commercialize autonomous driving technology in California. It also has the potential to provide a boost to the companies that only use electric vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;California has set important standards to aggressively address our climate crisis,&#8221; Min told TechCrunch. &#8220;My SB 500 aligns with these ambitions and takes a critical first step in requiring autonomous vehicles to be zero emission before they are put to widespread use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Proponents of the bill don&#8217;t want to see future means of transportation married to the technology of the past, pointing out the potential for AVs to either help or hurt attempts to cut emissions. California has a reputation for leading the rest of the country in EV adoption and other emissions-related policies, so the success or failure of this bill could create ripple effects in states across the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It definitely seems like we&#8217;re going to start seeing AVs in these fleet applications, whether that&#8217;s ride-hailing or delivery, and that makes it even more important that these vehicles are electric,&#8221; said Elizabeth Irvin, senior transportation analyst at UCS. &#8220;The average person drives their car 11,000 to 13,000 miles per year, but a full-time Uber or Lyft driver drives 30,000 or more.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The strategy</h2>
<p>Close to half of California&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation. And while there&#8217;s nothing quite like a smoggy Los Angeles sunset, supporters say the danger of not placing requirements on the AV industry could lead to a world in which autonomous commercial vehicles are commonplace and powered by fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In a statement defending support of this bill, UCS points to research that shows how AVs could dramatically increase driving, and thus emissions, as people get used to living the luxurious life of a passenger.<a href="https://ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2019/02/Where-Are-Self-Driving-Cars-Taking-Us-web.pdf"> One study</a>, which examined the potential effects of AVs on the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region transportation system in 2040, found that AVs would cause the total amount of driving to increase by as much as 66% relative to the 2040 baseline year.</p>

<p>Irvin told TechCrunch that UCS has been in talks with various stakeholders &#8212; such as Nuro, the SoftBank-backed autonomous delivery startup, and Cruise, General Motor&#8217;s self-driving subsidiary &#8212; regarding strategies for advancing policy that would require all AVs to be zero-emission in California before mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are supportive of efforts to accelerate the industry&#8217;s transition to clean energy, which aligns with Nuro&#8217;s goals and values,&#8221; said a spokesperson from Nuro. &#8220;We are excited for autonomous vehicles to pave the way for the rest of the auto industry, which we believe will lead to a greener and healthier future.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentiment is mirrored by Cruise, which unveiled last year a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/cruise-unveils-origin-an-electric-driverless-vehicle-designed-for-sharing/">driverless vehicle called Origin</a> that&#8217;s designed for sharing and powered by an all-electric platform built by GM, the result of a multi-year partnership with Honda. Cruise is not testing autonomous Origin vehicles in San Francisco yet; the battery platform is still undergoing testing at GM&#8217;s proving grounds. Cruise does have aspirations to roll out a fleet of autonomous vehicles — initially using the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt — as part of a ride-hailing, and possibly a delivery, service in San Francisco.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4Xx2OVeZSd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/cruise-unveils-origin-an-electric-driverless-vehicle-designed-for-sharing/">Cruise unveils Origin, an electric driverless vehicle designed for sharing</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Because this industry is so new, everyone has a choice to be an EV or not,&#8221; Rob Grant, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SVP government affairs at Cruise, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like you have to transform an existing fleet. You have a choice to do this in the beginning rather than going down this path and being forced to change it at some later date.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Hybrids versus electric</h2>
<p>Not all AVs use electric vehicles. The Ford Fusion hybrid and Chrysler Pacifica Plug-in Hybrid minivans have been the go-to choices for AV developers, including Argo AI, Aurora, Waymo and Voyage.</p>
<p>Argo AI is a technology platform company that works with major automakers, like Volkswagen and Ford, to develop autonomous driving systems. While Volkswagen&#8217;s ID.Buzz will be the company&#8217;s first fully electric self-driving car, Ford still prefers to take a more measured approach by modifying the hybrid Ford Fusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all want to transition to BEVs eventually, but we also need to find the right balance that will help develop a profitable, viable business model,&#8221; John Davis, chief engineer at Ford Autonomous Vehicles said. &#8220;This means launching with hybrids first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis outlined various challenges in developing all-electric vehicles as AVs, including depletion of range from on-board tech, decreased use of the vehicle during charge times and degradation of the battery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Testing shows that upwards of 50% of BEV range will be used up due to the computing power of an AV system, plus the A/C and entertainment systems that are likely required during a ride-hailing service (for passenger comfort),&#8221; Davis said. &#8220;We continue to be encouraged as battery chemistry and cost continue to improve to address these issues.&#8221;</p>

<p>Waymo, which tested and then launched a robotaxi service in a limited and growing area in the Phoenix suburbs, intends to bring a commercial service to California. The Mountain View, California-based company regularly tests its vehicles, which includes the electric Jaguar I-Pace, in San Francisco and the surrounding area. The company said it supports Newsom&#8217;s recent executive order, but stopped short of endorsing the current language in Min&#8217;s bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the first company to commercially deploy our fully autonomous technology to the public, we strongly support the goals outlined in Governor Newsom&#8217;s recent Executive Order N-79-20 which takes a holistic approach to transition California towards a 100% EV future,&#8221; a Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Waymo has business lines and partnerships that span ride-hailing, trucking and local delivery, and we want to ensure that California&#8217;s EV policy reflects the myriad issues and industries affected. It&#8217;s early in the legislative process, and we look forward to working with Sen. Min in his efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Industry sources familiar with the bill have noted that the current language, which is fairly brief, is just a placeholder and unlikely to make much headway this session. Those same sources have criticized the sponsors and author for neglecting to specify a plan for charging infrastructure or making distinctions between light and heavy-duty vehicles. Trucks carrying freight are expected to be among the first vehicles with widespread autonomous use. Most self-driving truck development occurs outside of California in regulatory-light states like Arizona and Texas. And while there are some efforts to develop electric and autonomous semi trucks, most testing today involves diesel-powered vehicles. That could prompt companies hoping to deploy in California to lean on the senator&#8217;s office to include an exemption for heavy-duty vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still looking to fill out details as we move through the legislative process, but UCS&#8217;s intention is that this bill stay focused on the electrification requirement,&#8221; responded Irvin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the world of early-stage startups, job titles are often a formality. In reality, each employee may handle a dozen responsibilities outside their job description. The choose-your-own-adventure type of work style is part of the magic of startups and often why generalists thrive here.</p>
<p>However, as a company progresses and the team grows, there comes a time when a founder needs to carve out dedicated roles. Of these positions, product management might be one of the most elusive — and key — roles to fill.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Product management might be one of the most elusive — and key — roles to fill.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We spoke to startup founders and operators to get their thoughts about how and when they hired their first product manager. Some of the things we talked about were:</p>
<ul>
<li> Which traits to look for.</li>
<li> Why it&#8217;s important to define the role before you look for your best fit.</li>
<li> Whether your new hire needs to have a technical background.</li>
<li> The best questions to ask in an interview.</li>
<li> How to time your first hire and avoid overhiring.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Don’t hire for the CEO of a product</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s start by working backward. Product managers often graduate into a CEO role or leave a company to become a founder. Like founders, talented product managers have innate leadership skills and are able to effectively and clearly communicate. Similarly, both roles require a person who is a visionary when it comes to the product and execution.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidblake?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">David Blake</a> was a product manager before he became a serial edtech founder who created <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/degreed-lands-new-cash-for-upskilling-in-a-down-market/">Degreed</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/learn-in-thinks-a-solution-to-layoffs-is-more-sabbaticals/">Learn In</a>, and most recently,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/the-first-rule-of-bookclub-no-boring-book-clubs/"> BookClub</a>. He says that experience helped him launch the first prototype of Degreed and attract first clients.</p>
<p>“The must-have skill is the ability to put the team&#8217;s best wisdom in check and inform the product decisions with users and potential clients to inform what you are building,” he said. The person “must also be able to take the team&#8217;s mission and develop and sell that narrative to users and potential clients. That is how you blaze a new trail, balance risk, while avoiding building a &#8216;faster horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The overlapping synergies between PMs and founders is part of the reason why the role is so confusing to define and hire for. <a href="https://www.kennorton.com/about/">Ken Norton,</a> former director of product at Figma who recently left to solo advise and coach product managers, says companies can start by defining what PMs are not: The CEO of the product.</p>
<p>“It’s about not handing off the product responsibilities to somebody,” he said. “You want the founder and the CEO to continue to be the evangelist and visionary.” Instead, the role is more about day to day “blocking and tackling.&#8221; Norton wrote a piece more than 15 years ago about <a href="https://www.kennorton.com/essays/productmanager.html">how to hire a product manager</a>, and it&#8217;s still an essential read for anyone interested in the field.</p>
<h2><strong>Define the role and set your expectations </strong></h2>
<p>Product managers help translate all the jugglers within a startup to each other; connecting the engineer with marketing, design with business development and sales with all the above. The role at its core is hard to define, but at the same time is the necessary plumbing for any startup that wants to be high-growth and ambitious.</p>
<p>While a successful product manager is a strong generalist, they have to have the ability to understand and humanize technical processes. The best candidates, then, have some sort of technical experience as an engineer or otherwise.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s medical device regulator has admitted it has concerns about VC-backed AI chatbot maker Babylon Health. It made the admission in a letter sent to a clinician who&#8217;s been raising the alarm about Babylon&#8217;s approach toward patient safety and corporate governance since 2017.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/technology-and-innovation/regulator-reveals-concerns-over-babylons-chatbot/7029598.article?utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=newsfeed">HSJ</a> reported on the MHRA&#8217;s letter to Dr David Watkins yesterday. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TechCrunch has reviewed the letter (see below), which is dated December 4, 2020. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We&#8217;ve also seen additional context about what was discussed in a meeting referenced in the letter, as well as reviewing other correspondence between Watkins and the regulator in which he details a number of wide-ranging concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In an interview he emphasized that the concerns the regulator shares are &#8220;far broader&#8221; than the (important but) single issue of chatbot safety.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The issues relate to the corporate governance of the company &#8212; how they approach safety concerns. How they approach people who raise safety concerns,&#8221; Watkins told TechCrunch. &#8220;That&#8217;s the concern. And some of the ethics around the mis-promoting of medical devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The overall story is they did promote something that was dangerously flawed. They made misleading claims with regards to how [the chatbot] should be used &#8212; its intended use &#8212; with [Babylon CEO] Ali Parsa promoting it as a ‘diagnostic’ system &#8212; which was never the case. The chatbot was never approved for ‘diagnosis&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion, in 2018 the MHRA should have taken a much firmer stance with Babylon and made it clear to the public that the claims that were being made were false &#8212; and that the technology was not approved for use in the way that Babylon were promoting it,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;That should have happened and it didn&#8217;t happen because the regulations at that time were not fit for purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In reality there is no regulatory ‘approval’ process for these technologies and the legislation doesn&#8217;t require a company to act ethically,&#8221; Watkins also told us. &#8220;We&#8217;re reliant on the healthtech sector behaving responsibly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The consultant oncologist began raising red flags about Babylon with UK healthcare regulators (CQC/MHRA) as early as February 2017 &#8212; initially over the &#8220;apparent absence of any robust clinical testing or validation&#8221;, as he puts it in correspondence to regulators. However with Babylon opting to deny problems and go on the attack against critics his concerns mounted.</p>
<p>An admission by the medical devices regulator that all Watkins&#8217; concerns are &#8220;valid&#8221; and are &#8220;ones that we share&#8221; blows Babylon&#8217;s deflective PR tactics out of the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Babylon cannot say that they have always adhered to the regulatory requirements &#8212; at times they have not adhered to the regulatory requirements. At different points throughout the development of their system,&#8221; Watkins also told us, adding: &#8220;Babylon never took the safety concerns as seriously as they should have. Hence this issue has dragged on over a more than three year period.&#8221;</p>
<p>During this time the company has been steaming ahead inking wide-ranging &#8216;digitization&#8217; deals with healthcare providers around the world &#8212; including a 10-year deal agreed with the UK city of Wolverhampton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/babylon-health-is-building-an-integrated-ai-based-health-app-to-serve-a-city-of-300k-in-england/">last year</a> to provide an integrated app that&#8217;s intended to have a reach of 300,000 people.</p>
<p>It also has a 10 year agreement with the government of Rwanda to support digitization of its health system, including via digitally enabled triage. Other markets it&#8217;s rolled into include the US, Canada and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p><span class="il">Babylon</span> says it now covers more than 20 million patients and has done 8 million consultations and &#8220;AI interactions&#8221; globally. But is it operating to the high standards people would expect of a medical device company?</p>

<h2>Safety, ethical and governance concerns</h2>
<p>In a written summary, dated October 22, of a video call which took place between Watkins and the UK medical devices regulator on September 24 last year, he summarizes what was discussed in the following way: &#8220;I talked through and expanded on each of the points outlined in the document, specifically; the misleading claims, the dangerous flaws and Babylon&#8217;s attempts to deny/suppress the safety issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his account of this meeting, Watkins goes on to report: &#8220;There appeared to be general agreement that Babylon’s corporate behaviour and governance fell below the standards expected of a medical device/healthcare provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was informed that Babylon Health would not be shown leniency (given their relationship with [UK health secretary] Matt Hancock),&#8221; he also notes in the summary &#8212; a reference to Hancock being a publicly enthusiastic user of Babylon&#8217;s &#8216;GP at hand&#8217; app (for which he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/30/matt-hancock-accused-of-breaching-code-over-gp-app-endorsement">accused in 2018 of breaking the ministerial code</a>).</p>
<p>In a separate document, which Watkins compiled and sent to the regulator last year, he details 14 areas of concern &#8212; covering issues including the safety of the Babylon chatbot&#8217;s triage; &#8220;misleading and conflicting&#8221; T&amp;Cs &#8212; which he says contradict promotional claims it has made to hype the product; as well as what he describes as a &#8220;multitude of ethical and governance concerns&#8221; &#8212; including its aggressive response to anyone who raises concerns about the safety and efficacy of its technology.</p>
<p>This has included a public attack campaign against Watkins himself, which we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/first-do-no-harm/">reported on last year</a>; as well as what he lists in the document as &#8220;legal threats to avoid scrutiny &amp; adverse media coverage&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here he notes that Babylon&#8217;s response to safety concerns he had raised back in 2018 &#8212; which had been reported on by the HSJ &#8212; was also to go on the attack, with the company claiming then that &#8220;vested interest&#8221; were spreading &#8220;false allegations&#8221; in an attempt to &#8220;see us fail&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The allegations were not false and it is clear that Babylon chose to mislead the HSJ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">readership, opting to place patients at risk of harm, in order to protect their own reputation,&#8221; writes Watkins in associated commentary to the regulator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He goes on to point out that, in May 2018, the MHRA had itself independently notified Babylon Health of two incidents related to the safety of its chatbot (one involving missed symptoms of a heart attack, another missed symptoms of DVT) &#8212; yet the company still went on to publicly rubbish the <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/technology-and-innovation/safety-regulators-reviewing-concerns-about-babylons-chatbot/7022612.article">HSJ&#8217;s report</a> the following month (which was entitled: &#8216;<em>Safety regulators investigating concerns about Babylon&#8217;s &#8216;chatbot&#8221;</em>).</span></p>
<p>Wider governance and operational concerns Watkins raises in the document include Babylon&#8217;s use of staff NDAs &#8212; which he argues leads to a culture inside the company where staff feel unable to speak out about any safety concerns they may have; and what he calls &#8220;inadequate medical device vigilance&#8221; (whereby he says the Babylon bot doesn’t routinely request feedback on the patient outcome post triage, arguing that: &#8220;The absence of any robust feedback system significant impairs the ability to identify adverse outcomes&#8221;).</p>
<p>Re: unvarnished staff opinions, it&#8217;s interesting to note that <a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/Babylon-Health-Reviews-E1338681_P3.htm?sort.sortType=OR&amp;sort.ascending=false&amp;filter.iso3Language=eng">Babylon&#8217;s Glassdoor rating</a> at the time of writing is just 2.9 stars &#8212; with only a minority of reviewers saying they would recommend the company to a friend and where Parsa&#8217;s approval rating as CEO is also only 45% on aggregate. (&#8220;The technology is outdated and flawed,&#8221; writes one Glassdoor reviewer who is listed as a current Babylon Health employee working as a clinical ops associate in Vancouver, Canada &#8212; where privacy regulators <a href="https://www.oipc.ab.ca/news-and-events/news-releases/2020/commissioner-investigating-babylon-by-telus-health-app.aspx">have an open investigation</a> into its app. Among the listed cons in the one-star review is the claim that: &#8220;The well-being of patients is not seen as a priority. A real joke to healthcare. Best to avoid.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Per Watkins&#8217; report of his online meeting with the MHRA, he says the regulator agreed NDAs are &#8220;problematic&#8221; and impact on the ability of employees to speak up on safety issues.</p>
<p>He also writes that it was acknowledged that Babylon employees may fear speaking up because of legal threats. His minutes further record that: &#8220;Comment was made that the MHRA are able to look into concerns that are raised anonymously.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the summary of his concerns about Babylon, Watkins also flags an event in 2018 which the company held in London to promote its chatbot &#8212; during which he writes that it made a number of &#8220;misleading claims&#8221;, such as that its AI generates health advice that is &#8220;on-par with top-rated practicing clinicians&#8221;.</p>
<p>The flashy claims led to a blitz of hyperbolic headlines about the bot&#8217;s capabilities &#8212; helping Babylon to generate hype at a time when it was likely to have been pitching investors to raise more funding.</p>
<p>The London-based startup was valued at $2BN+ in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/babylon-health-confirms-550m-raise-to-expand-its-ai-based-health-services-to-the-us-and-asia/">2019</a> when it raised a massive $550M Series C round, from investors including Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and a large (unnamed) U.S.-based health insurance company, as well as insurance giant Munich Re’s ERGO Fund &#8212; trumpeting the raise at the time as the largest-ever in Europe or U.S. for digital health delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;It should be noted that Babylon Health have never withdrawn or attempted to correct the misleading claims made at the AI Test Event [which generated press coverage it&#8217;s still using as a promotional tool on its website in certain jurisdictions],&#8221; Watkins writes to the regulator. &#8220;Hence, there remains an ongoing risk that the public will put undue faith in Babylon’s unvalidated medical device.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his summary he also includes several pieces of anonymous correspondence from a number of people claiming to work (or have worked) at Babylon &#8212; which make a number of additional claims. &#8220;There is huge pressure from investors to demonstrate a return,&#8221; writes one of these. &#8220;Anything that slows that down is seen [a]s avoidable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The allegations made against Babylon Health are not false and were raised in good faith in the interests of patient safety,&#8221; Watkins goes on to assert in his summary to the regulator. &#8220;Babylon’s ‘repeated’ attempts to actively discredit me as an individual raises serious questions regarding their corporate culture and trustworthiness as a healthcare provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its letter to Watkins (screengrabbed below), the MHRA tells him: &#8220;Your concerns are all valid and ones that we share&#8221;.</p>
<p>It goes on to thank him for personally and publicly raising issues &#8220;at considerable risk to yourself&#8221;.</p>

<p>Babylon has been contacted for a response to the MHRA&#8217;s validation of Watkins&#8217; concerns. At the time of writing it had not responded to our request for comment.</p>
<p>The startup told the HSJ that it meets all the local requirements of regulatory bodies for the countries it operates in, adding: &#8220;Babylon is committed to upholding the highest of standards when it comes to patient safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one aforementioned<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/first-do-no-harm/"> aggressive incident last year</a>, Babylon put out a press release attacking Watkins as a &#8216;troll&#8217; and seeking to discredit the work he was doing to highlight safety issues with the triage performed by its chatbot.</p>
<p>It also claimed its technology had been &#8220;NHS validated&#8221; as a &#8220;safe service 10 times&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear what validation process Babylon was referring to there &#8212; and Watkins also flags and queries that claim in his correspondence with the MHRA, writing: &#8220;As far as I am aware, the Babylon chatbot has not been validated &#8212; in which case, their press release is misleading.&#8221;</p>
<p>The MHRA&#8217;s letter, meanwhile, makes it clear that the current regulatory regime in the UK for software-based medical device products does not adequately cover software-powered &#8216;healthtech&#8217; devices, such as Babylon&#8217;s chatbot.</p>
<p>Per Watkins there is no approval process, currently. Such devices are merely registered with the MHRA &#8212; but there&#8217;s no legal requirement that the regulator assess them or even receive documentation related to their development. He says they exist independently &#8212; with the MHRA holding a register.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have raised a complex set of issues and there are several aspects that fall outside of our existing remit,&#8221; the regulator concedes in the letter. &#8220;This highlights some issues which we are exploring further, and which may be important as we develop a new regulatory framework for medical devices in the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>An update to pan-EU medical devices regulation &#8212; which will bring in new requirements for software-based medical devices, and had been originally intended to be implemented in the UK in May last year &#8212; will no longer take place, given the country has left the bloc.</p>
<p>The UK is instead in the process of formulating its own regulatory update for medical device rules. This means there&#8217;s still a gap around software-based &#8216;healthtech&#8217; &#8212; which isn&#8217;t expected to be fully plugged for several years. (Although Watkins notes there have been some tweaks to the regime, such as a partial lifting of confidentiality requirements last year.)</p>
<p>In a speech last year, health secretary Hancock <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-03-02/debates/FF798F53-ED6D-4AE5-B33A-780FBF45C151/MedicinesAndMedicalDevicesBill">told parliament</a> that with the government aimed to formulate a regulatory system for medical devices that is &#8220;nimble enough&#8221; to keep up with tech-fuelled developments such as health wearables and AI while &#8220;maintaining and enhancing patient safety&#8221;. It will include giving the MHRA &#8220;a new power to disclose to members of the public any safety concerns about a device&#8221;, he said then.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the existing (outdated) regulatory regime appears to be continuing to tie the regulator&#8217;s hands &#8212; at least vis-a-vis what they can say in public about safety concerns. It has taken Watkins making its letter to him public to do that.</p>
<p>In the letter the MHRA writes that &#8220;confidentiality unfortunately binds us from saying more on any specific investigation&#8221;, although it also tells him: &#8220;Please be assured that your concerns are being taken seriously and if there is action to be taken, then we will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the wording of the letter, I think it was clear that they wanted to provide me with a message that we do hear you, that we understand what you&#8217;re saying, we acknowledge the concerns which you&#8217;re raised, but we are limited by what we can do,&#8221; Watkins told us.</p>
<p>He also said he believes the regulator has engaged with Babylon over concerns he&#8217;s raised these past three years &#8212; noting the company has made a number of changes after he had raised specific queries (such as to its T&amp;Cs which had initially said it&#8217;s not a medial device but were subsequently withdrawn and changed to acknowledge it is; or claims it had made that the chatbot is &#8220;100% safe&#8221; which were withdrawn &#8212; after an intervention by the Advertising Standards Authority in that case).</p>
<p>The chatbot itself has also been tweaked to put less emphasis on the diagnosis as an outcome and more emphasis on the triage outcome, per Watkins.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve taken a piecemeal approach [to addressing safety issues with chatbot triage]. So I would flag an issue [publicly via Twitter] and they would only look at that very specific issue. Patients of that age, undertaking that exact triage assessment &#8212; &#8216;okay, we&#8217;ll fix that, we&#8217;ll fix that&#8217; &#8212; and they would put in place a [specific fix]. But sadly, they never spent time addressing the broader fundamental issues within the system. Hence, safety issues would repeatedly crop up,&#8221; he said, citing examples of multiple issues with cardiac triages that he also raised with the regulator.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;When I spoke to the people who work at Babylon they used to have to do these hard fixes&#8230; All they&#8217;d have to do is just kind of &#8216;dumb it down&#8217; a bit. So, for example, for anyone with chest pain it would immediately say go to A&amp;E. They would take away any thought process to it,&#8221; he added. (It also of course risks wasting healthcare resources &#8212; as he also points out in remarks to the regulators.)</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how they over time got around these issues. But it highlights the challenges and difficulties in developing these tools. It&#8217;s not easy. And if you try and do it quickly and don&#8217;t give it enough attention then you just end up with something which is useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watkins also suspects the MHRA has been involved in getting Babylon to remove certain pieces of hyperbolic promotional material related to the 2018 AI event from its website.</p>
<p>In one curious episode, also related to the 2018 event, Babylon&#8217;s CEO demoed an AI-powered interface that appeared to show real-time transcription of a patient&#8217;s words combined with an &#8217;emotion-scanning&#8217; AI &#8212; which he said scanned facial expressions in real-time to generate an assessment of how the person was feeling &#8212; with Parsa going on to tell the audience: &#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve built. None of this is for show. All of this will be either in the market or already in the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>However neither feature has actually been brought to market by Babylon as yet. Asked about this last month, the startup told TechCrunch: <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;The emotion detection functionality, seen in old versions of our clinical portal demo, was developed and built by <span class="il">Babylon</span>&#8216;s AI team. <span class="il">Babylon</span> conducts extensive user testing, which is why our technology is continually evolving to meet the needs of our patients and clinicians. After undergoing pre-market user-testing with our clinicians, we prioritised other AI-driven features in our clinical portal over the emotion recognition function, with a focus on improving the operational aspects of our service.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly found [the MHRA&#8217;s letter] very reassuring and I strongly suspect that the MHRA have been engaging with Babylon to address concerns which have been identified over the past three year period,&#8221; Watkins also told us today. &#8220;The MHRA don’t appear to have been ignoring the issues but Babylon simply deny any problems and can sit behind the confidentiality clauses.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement on the current regulatory situation for software-based medical devices in the UK, the MHRA told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>The MHRA ensures that manufacturers of medical devices comply with the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (as amended). Please refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-a-non-compliant-medical-device-enforcement-process/how-mhra-ensures-the-safety-and-quality-of-medical-devices">existing guidance</a>.</p>
<p>The Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 provides the foundation for a new improved regulatory framework that is currently being developed. It will consider all aspects of medical device regulation, including the risk classification rules that apply to Software as a Medical Device (SaMD).</p>
<p>The UK will continue to recognise CE marked devices until 1 July 2023. After this time, requirements for the UKCA Mark must be met. This will include the revised requirements of the new framework that is currently being developed.</p>
<p>The Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 allows the MHRA to undertake its regulatory activities with a greater level of transparency and share information where that is in the interests of patient safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>The regulator declined to be interviewed or response to questions about the concerns it says in the letter to Watkins that it shares about Babylon &#8212; telling us: &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The MHRA investigates all concerns but does not comment on individual cases.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Patient safety is paramount and we will always investigate where there are concerns about safety, including discussing those concerns with individuals that report them,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Watkins raised one more salient point on the issue of patient safety for &#8216;cutting edge&#8217; tech tools &#8212; asking where is the &#8220;real life clinical data&#8221;? So far, he says the studies patients have to go on are limited assessments &#8212; often made by the chatbot makers themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one quite telling thing about this sector is the fact that there&#8217;s very little real life data out there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These chatbots have been around for a good few years now&#8230; And there&#8217;s been enough time to get real life clinical data and yet it hasn&#8217;t appeared and you just wonder if, is that because in the real-life setting they are actually not quite as useful as we think they are?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Optimizely co-founder Dan Siroker said the idea for his new startup <a href="https://get.scribe.ai">Scribe</a> goes back to a couple of personal experiences — and although Scribe&#8217;s first product is focused on Zoom, those experiences weren&#8217;t Zoom-related at all.</p>
<p>Instead, Siroker recalled starting to go deaf and then having an &#8220;epiphany&#8221; the first time he put in a hearing aid, as he recovered a sense he thought he&#8217;d lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;That really was the spark that got me thinking about other opportunities to augment things your body naturally fails at,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Siroker added that memory was an obvious candidate, particularly since he also has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">aphantasia</a> — the inability to visualize mental images, which made it &#8220;hard to remember certain things.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Optimizely hires Jay Larson as its new CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/optimizely-new-ceo/embed/#?secret=0uXMNaKeEo" data-secret="0uXMNaKeEo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It may jog your own memory if I note that Siroker founded Optimizely with Pete Koomen in 2010, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/optimizely-new-ceo/">stepped down from the CEO role</a> in 2017, with the testing and personalization startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/episerver-acquires-optimizely/">acquired by Episerver last year</a>. (And now Episerver itself is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/episerver-rebrands-as-optimizely/">rebranding as Optimizely</a>.)</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the present day and Siroker is now CEO at Scribe, which is taking signups for its first product. That product integrates into Zoom meetings and transforms them into searchable, shareable transcripts.</p>
<p>Siroker demonstrated it for me during our Zoom call. Scribe appears in the meeting as an additional participant, recording video and audio while creating a real-time transcript. During or after the meeting, users can edit the transcript, watch or listen to the associated moment in the recording and highlight important points.</p>
<p>From a technological perspective, none of this feels like a huge breakthrough, but I was impressed by the seamlessness of the experience — just by adding an additional participant, I had a full recording and searchable transcript of our conversation that I could consult later, including while I was writing this story.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121789" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121789" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2121789" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Screenshot.jpg?w=680" alt="Scribe screenshot" width="680" height="422" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Screenshot.jpg 949w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=768,477 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=680,422 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121789" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Scribe</p></div></p>
<p>Although Scribe is recording the meeting, Siroker said he wants this to be more like a note-taking replacement than a tape recorder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say you and I were meeting and I came to that meeting with a pen and paper and I&#8217;m writing down what you&#8217;re saying,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s totally socially acceptable — in some ways, it&#8217;s flattering &#8230; If instead, I brought a tape recorder and plopped in front of you and hit record — you might actually have this experience — with some folks, that feels very different.&#8221;</p>
<p>The key, he argued, is that Scribe recordings and transcripts can be edited, and you can also turn individual components on and off at any time.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="f0TLDU3tXb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/best-practices-for-zoom-board-meetings-at-early-stage-startups/">Best practices for Zoom board meetings at early-stage startups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Best practices for Zoom board meetings at early-stage startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/best-practices-for-zoom-board-meetings-at-early-stage-startups/embed/#?secret=f0TLDU3tXb" data-secret="f0TLDU3tXb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This is not a permanent record,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a shared artifact that we all create as we have a meeting that — just like a Google Doc — you can go back and make changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s still possible that Scribe could record some embarrassing comments, and the recordings could eventually get meeting participants in trouble. (After all, leaked company meeting recordings have already prompted a number of news stories.) Siroker said he hopes that&#8217;s &#8220;not common,&#8221; but he also argued that it could create an increased sense of transparency and accountability if it happens occasionally.</p>
<p>Scribe has raised around $5 million in funding, across a round led by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and another led by First Round Capital.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121793" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121793" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2121793" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invite-Scribe-in-5-Seconds.jpg?w=680" alt="Scribe screenshot" width="680" height="373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invite-Scribe-in-5-Seconds.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invite-Scribe-in-5-Seconds.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invite-Scribe-in-5-Seconds.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invite-Scribe-in-5-Seconds.jpg?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invite-Scribe-in-5-Seconds.jpg?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invite-Scribe-in-5-Seconds.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121793" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Scribe</p></div></p>
<p>Siroker told me he sees Zoom as just the &#8220;beachhead&#8221; for Scribe&#8217;s ambitions. Next up, the company will be adding support for products like Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. Eventually, he hopes to build a new &#8220;hive mind&#8221; for organizations, where everyone is &#8220;smarter and better&#8221; because so many of their conversations and knowledge are now searchable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where we go after that really depends on where we think we can have the biggest positive impact on people&#8217;s lives,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s harder to make a case for personal conversations you have with a spouse but … I think if you strike the right balance between value and privacy and control, you could really get people to adopt this in a way that actually is a win-win.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if Scribe actually achieves its mission of helping us to record and recall information in a wide variety of contexts, could that have an impact on our natural ability to remember things?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes is the answer, and I think that&#8217;s okay,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;Your brain has limited energy &#8230; Remembering the things somebody said a few weeks ago is something a computer can do amazingly. Why waste your precious brain cycles doing that?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new auto-injecting pill might soon become a replacement for subcutaneous injection treatments.</p>
<p>The idea for this <a href="https://www.ranitherapeutics.com/technology/">so-called robotic pill</a> came out of a research project around eight years ago from <a href="https://www.incubelabs.com/">InCube Labs</a> — a life sciences lab operated by Rani Therapeutics Chairman and CEO Mir Imran, who has degrees in electrical and biomedical engineering from Rutgers University. A prominent figure in life sciences innovation, Imran has founded more than 20 medical device companies and helped develop the world’s first implantable cardiac defibrillator.</p>
<p>In working on the technology behind San Jose-based Rani Therapeutics, Imran and his team wanted to find a way to relieve some of the painful side effects of subcutaneous (or under-the-skin) injections, while also improving the treatment’s efficacy. “The technology itself started with a very simple thesis,” said Imran in an interview. “We thought, why can’t we create a pill that contains a biologic drug that you swallow, and once it gets to the intestine, it transforms itself and delivers a pain-free injection?”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rani Therapeutics’ approach is based on inherent properties of the gastrointestinal tract. An injecting mechanism in their pill is surrounded by a pH-sensitive coating that dissolves as the capsule moves from a patient’s stomach to the small intestine. This helps ensure that the pill starts injecting the medicine in the right place at the right time. Once there, the reactants mix and produce carbon dioxide, which in turn inflates a small balloon that helps create a pressure difference to help inject the drug-loaded needles into the intestinal wall. “So it’s a really well-timed cascade of events that results in the delivery of this needle,” said Imran.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Synthetic biology startups are giving investors an appetite&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/synthetic-biology-startups-ride-a-wave-of-investor-interest/embed/#?secret=CSxVecwndY" data-secret="CSxVecwndY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite its somewhat mechanical procedure, the pill itself contains no metal or springs, reducing the chance of an inflammatory response in the body. The needles and other components are instead made of injectable-grade polymers, that Imran said has been used in other medical devices as well. Delivering the injections to the upper part of the small intestine also carries little risk of infection, as the prevalence of stomach acid and bile from the liver prevent bacteria from readily growing there.</p>
<p>One of Imran’s priorities for the pill was to eliminate the painful side effects of subcutaneous injections. “It wouldn’t make sense to replace them with another painful injection,” he said. “But biology was on our side, because your intestines don’t have the kind of pain sensors your skin does.” What’s more, administering the injection into the highly vascularized wall of the small intestine actually allows the treatment to work more efficiently than when applied through subcutaneous injection, which typically deposits the treatment into fatty tissue.</p>

<p>Imran and his team have plans to use the pill for a variety of indications, including the growth hormone disorder acromegaly, diabetes and osteoporosis. In January 2020, their acromegaly treatment, Octreotide, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rani-therapeutics-announces-positive-phase-i-study-results-of-oral-octreotide-using-ranipill-300992818.html?tc=eml_cleartime">demonstrated both safety and sustained bioavailability</a> in primary clinical trials. They hope to pursue future clinical trials for other indications, but chose to prioritize acromegaly initially because of its well-established treatment drug but &#8220;very painful injection,&#8221; Imran said.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Rani Therapeutics <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/rani-therapeutics-nets-69m-to-transform-injections-into-easy-to-swallow-robotic-pill">raised $69 million in new funding</a> to help further develop and test their platform. “This will finance us for the next several years,” said Imran. “Our approach to the business is to make the technology very robust and manufacturable.”</p>

		<a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alradford">Alan Radford</a> is regional CTO of <a href="https://www.oneidentity.com/">One Identity</a> and has a passion for helping organizations solve unique challenges in the identity and access management space. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) is making a major impact across every industry. But many don’t know how common the technology is and may not realize that they are interacting with it regularly. RPA is a growing megatrend — by 2022, Gartner predicts that 90% of organizations globally will have adopted RPA and its received over $1.8 billion in investments in the past two years alone.</p>
<p>Due to the shift to remote work, companies across every industry have implemented some form of RPA to simplify their operations to deal with an influx of requests. For example, when major airlines were bombarded with cancellation requests at the onset of the pandemic, RPA became essential to their customer service strategy.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Throughout 2021, security teams will begin to realize the unconsidered security challenges of robotic process automation.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>According to Forrester, one major airline had over 120,000 cancellations during the first few weeks of the pandemic. By utilizing RPA to handle the influx of cancellations, the airline was able to simplify its refund process and assist customers in a timely matter.</p>
<p>Delivering this type of streamlined cancellation process with such high demand would have been extremely challenging, if not impossible, without RPA technology.</p>
<p>The multitude of other RPA use cases that have popped up since COVID-19 have made it evident that RPA isn’t going away anytime soon. In fact, interest in the usage of RPA is at an unprecedented high. Gartner inquiries related to RPA increased over 1,000% during 2020 as companies continue to invest.</p>
<p>However, there’s one big issue that’s commonly overlooked when it comes to RPA — security. Like we’ve seen with other innovations, the security aspect of RPA isn’t implemented in the early stages of development — leaving organizations vulnerable to cybercriminals.</p>
<p>If the security vulnerabilities of RPA aren’t addressed quickly, there will be a string of significant RPA breaches in 2021. However, by realizing that these new “digital coworkers” have identities of their own, companies can secure RPA before they make the headlines as the latest major breach.</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding RPA’s digital identity</strong></h2>
<p>With RPA, digital workers are created to take over repetitive manual tasks that have been traditionally performed by humans. Their interaction directly with business applications mimics the way humans use credentials and privilege — ultimately giving the robot an identity of its own. An identity that is created and operates much faster than any human identity but doesn’t eat, sleep, take holidays, go on strike or even get paid.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">&#x200d;Eco, which has built out a digital global cryptocurrency platform, announced Friday that it has raised $26 million in a funding round led by a16z Crypto.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Founded in 2018, the SF-based startup’s platform is designed to be used as a payment tool around the world for daily-use transactions. The company emphasizes that it’s “not a bank, checking account, or credit card.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re building something better than all of those combined,” it said in a <a href="https://www.eco.com/introducing-eco">blog post</a>. The company’s mission has also been described as an effort to use cryptocurrency as a way “to marry savings and spending,” according to this CoinList <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinlist-andy-bromberg-eco">article</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Eco users can earn up to 5% annually on their deposits and get 5% cash back when transacting with merchants such as Amazon, Uber and others. Next up: The company says it will give its users the ability to pay bills, pay friends and more “all from the same, single wallet.” That same wallet, it says, rewards people every time they spend or save.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After a “successful” alpha test with millions of dollars deposited, the company’s Eco App is now available to the public.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gemini is launching a credit card with bitcoin rewards&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/gemini-is-launching-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/embed/#?secret=oen3RpJwWR" data-secret="oen3RpJwWR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">A slew of other VC firms participated in Eco’s latest financing, including Founders Fund, Activant Capital, Slow Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Tribe Capital, Valor Capital Group and more than one hundred other funds and angels. Expa and Pantera Capital co-led the company’s $8.5 million funding round.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CoinList co-founder Andy Bromberg stepped down from his role last fall to head up Eco. The startup was originally called Beam before rebranding to Eco “thanks to involvement by founding advisor, Garrett Camp, who held the Eco brand,” according to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinlist-andy-bromberg-eco">Coindesk</a>. Camp is an Uber co-founder and Expa is his venture fund.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For a16z Crypto, leading the round is in line with its mission.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/03/05/eco-crypto-fintech/">blog post</a> co-written by <a href="https://a16z.com/author/katie-haun/">Katie Haun</a> and <a href="https://a16z.com/author/arianna-simpson/">Arianna Simpson</a>, the firm outlined why it’s pumped about Eco and its plans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“One of the challenges in any new industry — crypto being no exception — is building things that are not just cool for the sake of cool, but that manage to reach and delight a broad set of users,” they wrote. “Technology is at its best when it’s improving the lives of people in tangible, concrete ways&#8230;At a16z Crypto, we are constantly on the lookout for paths to get cryptocurrency into the hands of the next billion people. How do we think that will happen? By helping them achieve what they already want to do: spend, save, and make money — and by focusing users on tangible benefits, not on the underlying technology.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Eco is not the only crypto platform offering rewards to users. <a href="https://www.lolli.com/">Lolli</a> gives users free bitcoin or cash when they shop at over 1,000 top stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Albertsons Companies, the grocery giant that owns Safeway and Jewel-Osco, has launched a pilot program that will test grocery delivery using remote-controlled delivery robots developed by Silicon Valley startup Tortoise.</p>
<p>The pilot will start at two Safeway locations in Northern California, although Tortoise co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko said if successful, he expects the pilot to continue to scale to other stores in the state and possibly throughout the West Coast<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Safeway-branded delivery carts equipped with Tortoise&#8217;s sensors and software will be able to deliver goods to customers up to three miles from the store location. Remote-control operators located thousands of miles away will guide the delivery cart to its destination. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The delivery carts, which can </span>hold up to 120 pounds of groceries in four lockable containers, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">will initially</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> have a human escort. The aim is the remove the extra guide once the pilot is established. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Once the delivery cart arrives, the customer receives a text to come outside and pick up their groceries. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121617" style="width: 1070px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121617" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121617 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png" alt="Safeway Tortoise" width="1060" height="676" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png 1060w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1060px) 100vw, 1060px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2121617" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tortoise/Albertsons</p></div></p>
<p>The pilot is the latest example of large retailers adopting technology in a bid to get goods to customers faster. Amazon, Kroger and Walmart are just a few that are experimenting with delivery robots and using autonomous vehicles to shuttle goods to customers or within its distribution network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our team is obsessed with trying new and disruptive technologies that can bring more convenience for our customers,&#8221; Chris Rupp, EVP and chief customer and digital officer said in a statement. &#8220;We are willing to quickly test, learn and implement winning innovations that ensure we are offering the easiest and most convenient shopping experience in the entire industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal is also a validation of Tortoise&#8217;s move into delivery carts, a business pursuit that it kicked off less than a year ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea didn&#8217;t hit us until April,&#8221; Shevelenko said in a recent interview, who added that the first delivery cart was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/remote-controlled-delivery-carts-are-now-working-for-the-local-los-angeles-grocer/">launched in Los Angeles</a> in late October.</p>

<p>Tortoise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/ex-uber-exec-launches-startup-to-autonomously-reposition-electric-scooters-and-bikes/">got its start</a> by equipping electric scooters with cameras, electronics and firmware that allow teleoperators in distant locales to drive electric scooters and bikes to a rider or deliver it back to its proper parking spot. Last spring, as the COVID-19 pandemic raised demand for delivery services, Tortoise adapted its technology to a cart that could shuttle groceries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think about [Amazon] Prime, after that launched everyone expected two-day delivery, and seven days felt like a lifetime.&#8221; Now, two days feels like a lifetime as expectations shift to same-day delivery, he added.</p>
<p>Tortoise initially focused on neighborhood stores and specialty brand shops, through a partnership with an online grocery platform. Shevelenko&#8217;s strategy is to land contracts with big retailers while continuing to partner with online commerce platforms, which would allow it to reach smaller, independent stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech stocks are getting hammered today, with previously high-flying shares of software companies taking even more damage.</p>
<p>For a sector that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/what-the-hell-saas-valuations/">has enjoyed a year in the sun</a>, recent trading sessions have punctured a period of market adoration. It is too soon to say that the market is repricing tech stocks, but the selloff has reached the point of materiality and is therefore something we need to note.</p>
<p>As we write, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is off another 1.2% today after previous declines. The now-infamous ARK Innovation ETF is off 6.5% and the list of individual declines worth noting in the tech sector is very long indeed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The change in sentiment is clear in recent results. Here&#8217;s the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nasdaq Composite 52-week high: 14,175.12</li>
<li>Nasdaq Composite today: 12,561.13</li>
<li><strong>Percent change: -11.4%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And the damage intensifies if we consider just SaaS and cloud stocks. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bvp.com/bvp-nasdaq-emerging-cloud-index">the Bessemer cloud index</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bessemer cloud index 52-week high: 2,884.23</li>
<li>Bessemer cloud index today: 2,185.62</li>
<li><strong>Percent change: -24.2%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In more prosaic terms, the Nasdaq is in a technical <em>correction</em>, while SaaS stocks have reached <em>bear-market </em>territory. That&#8217;s quite a turnabout from recent all-time highs for both.</p>
<h2>Not just software</h2>
<p>Lost on the TechCrunch editing floor from late yesterday is a post we wrote noting the sharp declines in the value of insurtech stocks ahead of the impending public debut of Hippo, another neo-insurance company. The SPAC-led Hippo flotation will not touch down in a warm market. Instead, its contemporaries look like this today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lemonade 52-week high: $188.30</li>
<li>Lemonade current price: $84.72</li>
<li><strong>Change: -55.0%</strong></li>
<li>Root Insurance 52-week high: $29.48</li>
<li>Root Insurance current price: $12.38</li>
<li><strong>Change: -58.0%</strong></li>
<li>MetroMile 52-week high: $20.39</li>
<li>MetroMile current price: $10.04</li>
<li><strong>Change: -50.8%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The damage is widespread. Hell, recent IPO success-story Snowflake announced yesterday that it grew from revenues of $88 million in its year-ago quarter to $190 million in its most recent. And its stock is <em>off</em> more than 7% today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll leave it to you whether the changing public valuations are just a blip or a more staid change in the winds. But it does feel different out there.</p>
<p>For startups, this is all somewhat poor news. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/understanding-how-investors-value-growth-in-2021/">Valuations for public comps were strong in 2020</a>. To lose that halo in 2021 could crimp late-stage valuations, perhaps even reaching back to Series A and B rounds to limit some upside for growing upstarts. But such an impact will lag the public markets, so don&#8217;t expect things to change quite yet.</p>
<p>Still, every private investor has their eye on the exit when it comes to their deals. And if that exit is suddenly shrinking, so too might their interest in paying for quite so great a markup on their next deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pangea.app/">Pangea</a>, a marketplace startup that wants to connect college freelancers and companies in need of digital help, is seeing its growth rate accelerate as it races toward the impending Y Combinator demo day.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s traditional around this time that startups in the accelerator reach out to say hello. Provided that they are willing to chat growth metrics, we&#8217;re willing to listen.</p>
<p>Pangea, based in Providence, Rhode Island, is one such company. TechCrunch previously covered the company when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/pangea-app-raises-400k-seed-round-to-help-connect-student-workers-with-businesses/">announced a $400,000 pre-seed round last April</a>. Now most of the way <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/22861">through the YC accelerator</a>, the company dished regarding its recent growth and the fact that it added more capital to its accounts late last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2121591" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121591" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121591 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="236" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg 3621w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=300,236 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=768,604 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=680,535 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=1536,1208 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=2048,1611 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pangea-Team-YC.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121591" class="wp-caption-text">The Pangea team, from their shared house/office. Via the company.</p></div></p>
<p>On the growth side of the coin, Pangea CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/the_pangean">Adam Alpert</a> told TechCrunch the company has grown its gross merchandise volume (GMV) sequentially by 35% in each of the last two months. That&#8217;s a steep pace of GMV expansion. And the growth is adding up to real numbers, with Pangea facilitating $50,000 in transactions between college freelancers and businesses in the last four weeks.</p>
<p>Alpert said that its year-ago number was around $3,000 or $4,000.</p>
<p>And the company has managed to expand its market take rate to around 25%, tinkering with how it charges for its service. The result is a model that might resonate with anyone familiar with Fiverr, and may help the company more rapidly expand its net revenue.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s recent growth comes after it secured another $350,000 in November 2020 at a higher cap to its previously known pre-seed round. And, of course, it raised $125,000 from Y Combinator, funds that landed in its accounts this January.</p>

<p>Pangea is now active in 600 campuses, Alpert said. And it has found where its service is most in-demand, namely among emerging brands and smaller tech startups. Those firms often need the types of services that college kids are good at &#8212; social media, design, etc. &#8212; making them a good fit.</p>
<p>The company was somewhat coy on upcoming product news but was clear that it&#8217;s looking for investing partners as it works toward Series A scale. Let&#8217;s see how Pangea does in a few weeks.</p>

<p>The Battery report has a lot of data points that we&#8217;ll also work through in this week&#8217;s newsletter, but this morning, let&#8217;s narrow ourselves to thinking about rising aggregate software multiples, the breakdown of multiples expansion through the lens of relative growth rates, and cap it off with a nibble on the importance, or lack thereof, of cash flow margins for the valuation of high-growth software companies.</p>

<p>I chatted through pieces of the report with its authors, Battery&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/brandongleklen">Brandon Gleklen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neerajvc">Neeraj Agrawal</a>. So, we&#8217;ll lean on their perspective a little as we go to help us move quickly. This is our Friday treat. Or at least mine. Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>Rising multiples</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with an affirmation. Yes, software valuations have risen to record-high multiples in recent years. Here&#8217;s the Battery chart that makes the change clear:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. It was yet another crazy week, but we did our best to get through as much of it as we could. Here&#8217;s the rundown, in case you are reading along with us!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">Square is buying Tidal</a> in a deal that some are skeptical of, but one about which we found quite a lot to like.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/how-capital-as-a-service-can-help-you-get-your-first-check-in-2021/?tpcc=ECTW2020">How capital-as-a-service can get you your first check in 2021,</a> and a nod to Indie.VC, a pioneer in alternative financing for startups that announced it is shutting down net new investments this year.</li>
<li>Oscar Health <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/oscar-health-prices-ipo-at-39-and-secures-a-9-5b-valuation/">priced its IPO above its raised range</a>, which was good for it in terms of fundraising. However, since its debut the company has lost pricing altitude. Its declines mimic those of other public neo-insurance providers in what could be a new trend.</li>
<li>And sticking to the insurtech beat, Hippo is going public via a SPAC. Because everyone else is?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/compass-files-for-ipo/">Compass filed its S-1</a>, which triggered a debate on how it&#8217;s different than Opendoor.</li>
<li>Coupang&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/coupang-may-raise-up-to-3-6-billion-in-its-ipo-at-a-potential-valuation-of-51-billion/">is also coming</a>, replete with huge growth, an improving profitability picture and a massive valuation. This is one to watch.</li>
<li>There was also a whole global news circuit around grocery delivery startups, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">Instacart raising at a $39 billion valuation</a>.</li>
<li>And we wrapped with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/surreal-profile/">the Surreal seed round</a> that we found to be more than a little spicy. As it turns out, commercialized deepfakes are not merely on the way; they are here.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The man who arguably ushered in the current SPAC rush with the merger of Virgin Galactic with his Social Capital Hedosophia holding company has divested the remainder of his personal holdings in the space tourism company. Chamath Palihapitiya, who serves as the chairman of Virgin Galactic&#8217;s board, still holds 6.2% ownership in the company in partnership with investor Ian Osborne, but his solo holdings are now at zero.</p>
<p>Palihapitiya provided the following statement to TechCrunch via Virgin Galactic:</p>
<blockquote><p>I sold 6M shares for $200M which I am planning to redirect into a large investment I am making towards fighting climate change. The details of this investment will be made public in the next few months. I remain as dedicated as ever to Virgin Galactic’s team, mission and prospects.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Palihapitiya sold 3.8 million shares in December 2020, noting that he was selling that equity &#8220;to help manage [his] liquidity&#8221; in order to provide funding for &#8220;several new projects starting in 2021.&#8221; At the time, Palihapitiya said he &#8220;remained committed and excited fore the future of SPCE [Virgin Galactic&#8217;s stock ticker on the NYSE].&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please note that I filed a Form 4 for the sale of 3.8M shares of SPCE. I sold these shares to help manage my liquidity as I fund several new projects starting in 2021. I remain committed and excited for the future of SPCE. Just wanted to be transparent.<a href="https://t.co/OsUaVgVwKF">https://t.co/OsUaVgVwKF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1339425375063953409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The sale this week comprised 6.2 million shares, netting Palihapitiya roughly $213 million in the process.</p>
<p>Virgin Galactic has had some setbacks in its testing program that pushed the projected date of its first paying commercial tourists flights out into 2022, from an earlier target of sometime this year. The company installed Disney Parks leader Michael Colglazier as its new CEO last July, replacing George Whitesides, who moved into a chief space officer role, before it was <a href="https://spacenews.com/whitesides-steps-down-from-virgin-galactic/">revealed Thursday that he&#8217;s departing the company</a>. Whitesides&#8217; decision is said to be due to a desire to pursue public service opportunities.</p>
<p>Space as a sector has been a hotbed of SPAC activity of late, with mergers from a number of companies including Astra, Spire, Rocket Lab, BlackSky and Momentus announced over the course of the past year. Virgin Galactic, as one of the earliest, will be closely watched by anyone looking for a yardstick by which to measure the tactic. The company&#8217;s share value is down just over 5% pre-market, and has been on a steady decline since reaching an all-time peak around mid-February.</p>

<p>Headquartered in San Francisco and Tokyo, <a href="https://scrum.vc/">Scrum Ventures</a> is known for its accelerator programs focused on sports, food and smart-city tech. Today it announced the launch of a new incubator program that will help startups form business partnerships with Japanese corporations.</p>
<p>Called Scrum Studio, it will be spun out as an independent entity from Scrum Ventures, and headed by Masami Takahashi, who was previously strategy officer and general manager for WeWork Japan. Before that, he led Uber’s operations in Japan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Takahashi told TechCrunch that Scrum Studio is currently focused on the startups in its current accelerator programs (Sports Tech Tokyo, SmartCityX and Food Tech Studio), but plans to launch new programs in the future that also center on specific verticals. Through Scrum Studio, startups will be able to establish subsidiaries in Japan, or form joint ventures with Japanese companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://startupgenome.com/article/rankings-top-40">Startup Genome</a>, Beijing, London, Silicon Valley, Stockholm and Tel Aviv are some of the world&#8217;s best startup ecosystems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data and research organisation uses factors like performance, capital, market reach, connectedness, talent and knowledge to produce its rankings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup ecosystems from emerging markets excluding China and India didn&#8217;t make the organisation&#8217;s top 40 list last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a known fact that these regions lag well behind in all six factors, and decades might pass before they catch up to the standards of the aforementioned ecosystems.</span></p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.pariti.io/">Pariti</a>, a Kenyan B2B management startup founded by<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/yacob-berhane-38981541"> Yacob Berhane</a> and <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/wayele">Wossen Ayele</a>, wants to close the gap on three of the six factors &#8212; access to capital, knowledge and talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These issues, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that of access to capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is heightened</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, only 25% of funding goes to early-stage startups in Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="https://docs.preqin.com/reports/Preqin-Venture-Capital-In-Emerging-Markets-May-2018.pdf">compared to</a> more than 50% in Latin America,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MENA and South Asia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to build a solution that will help startups be successful that otherwise would not have been able to get the resources they needed,&#8221; CEO Berhane told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This problem is especially acute in Africa because it’s particularly nascent, but this platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is designed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for founders across emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anywhere that doesn’t have a mature, healthy startup ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how is the team at Pariti setting out to solve these problems? Ayele tells me that in one sense, Pariti is like an unbundled accelerator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a typical accelerator, founders will need to go through an intense program where they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are loaded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with information on all the things a startup will likely need to know at some point in their growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas with Pariti, founders get the needed information or resources that are immediately relevant to helping them get to the next stage of the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>A three-way marketplace</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a founder joins Pariti, they run their company through an assessment tool. There, they share pitch materials and information about their business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti then assesses each company across more than 70 information points ranging from the team and market to product and economics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Pariti benchmarks each company against its peers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies in the same industry, product stage, revenue and fundraising are some of the comparisons made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founder gets a detailed assessment with feedback on their pitch materials, the underlying metrics that they can use to develop their business and their ability to raise capital down the line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This approach gives us an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> granular view of their businesses, its strengths, weaknesses and allows us to triage the right resources to the founder based on their particular needs,&#8221; Ayele said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn&#8217;t end there. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti also connects the founders for one-on-one sessions with members of its global expert community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their backgrounds, according to Ayele, run the gamut from finance and marketing to product and technology across a range of sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti also provides vetted professionals for hire from its community if a founder needs more hands-on support building a product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayele says founders can continue to go through this process </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> times, getting assessed, implementing feedback and connecting with resources and talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On another end, Pariti allows investors to sign up on its platform, thereby collating data on their preferences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So once a startup wants to raise capital, the platform matches them with investors based on their profile and preferences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’ve built an algorithm-based matching platform where we curate relevant deals to VC investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also simplify the investor reach-out process for founders, which is a huge pain </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">point &#8212; especially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this ecosystem,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Ayele added. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121502" style="width: 1450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121502" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2121502 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="1048" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?resize=768,559 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?resize=680,495 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Investor-Platform.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121502" class="wp-caption-text">Pariti&#8217;s investor platform</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Pariti helps founders connect with affordable talent, access capital and develop their businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professionals can find interesting opportunities to mentor startups and get paid gig opportunities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also get more exposure to the early-stage ecosystem while tracking their progress, verifying their skills and increasing earning potential. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nvestors can run </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lean operations with access to proprietary deal flow, automated deal filtering and on-demand experts to support due diligence, research and portfolio support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the COO, the company has seen a tremendous amount of value built through the platform so far. A testament to this is an experience shared by Kiiru Muhoya, founder of Kenyan fintech startup Fingo Africa with TechCrunch, on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how the platform helped him raise a $250,000 pre-seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that after going through Pariti&#8217;s assessment ahead of a planned fundraiser, he realized that the market he was targeting was too small</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, he needed to learn more about what VCs were looking for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muhoya decided to switch to being at the other end of things. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the expert platform on Pariti, he began to review companies and provided feedback to other founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This led him to take some months off to pivot his business based on Pariti&#8217;s first feedback and what he had learned from the expert platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He took his startup through another assessment on the platform and thus closed the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has made significant strides since launching in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has over 500 companies across 42 countries, 100 freelance experts and 60 investors using its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berhane also adds that five funds currently use Pariti&#8217;s operating system for their deal management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we’re building the rails for how ventures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and scaled in emerging markets. We have partners in place across emerging markets, including Latin America and India. We also have a strong interest in the United States, where we see a real need for our platform,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Berhane said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It charges a subscription model for investors, but Berhane wouldn&#8217;t disclose the numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He says that Pariti will begin to charge a subscription fee for founders as well. Another revenue stream comes when</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investors or founders pay a certain transaction fee when using Pariti&#8217;s freelance experts for projects. The same happens when there&#8217;s any fundraise executed from the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about fundraising, the company recently secured an undisclosed pre-seed capital from angels and VCs like 500 Startups, Kepple Africa and Huddle VC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it hasn&#8217;t been smooth sailing for Pariti, as one issue that has stood out in dealing with founders and investors is trust</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berhane says founders have shared some horror stories about engaging with investors, while investors have shared trust concerns about founders reporting false numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pariti tries to address this by providing NDAs for both parties where the company will not share founders&#8217; data </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with investors until they want it to be shared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  And investors won’t get deals that Pariti hasn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thoroughly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vetted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both founders are of East African descent &#8212; Berhane from Eritrea and Ayele from Ethiopia &#8212; and crossed paths a couple of times but took different routes to be where they are now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Image Credits: Khadija M Farah &amp; Rebecca Ume Crook</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayele started his career at a consulting shop with offices across East Africa before moving back to the U.S. for law school</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, he got his first exposure to the early-stage startup world and worked with an emerging markets-focused VC fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I could see how technology and innovation could play a role in helping communities &#8212; whether it’s through financial inclusion, access to essential goods and services, connecting people at the base of the pyramid to markets,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon graduation and completion of his legal training, Ayele headed back to Nairobi to get involved with its growing African startup ecosystem, where he and Berhane founded the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The annual meetings of the Chinese parliament and its advisory body are underway in Beijing this week. Top executives from some of China&#8217;s largest tech firms are among the thousands of delegates who attend and put forward their opinions. Here is a look at what the tech bosses are proposing for China&#8217;s digital economy.</p>
<h3>Pony Ma</h3>
<p>More regulatory scrutiny is needed for the country&#8217;s budding internet economy, Tencent&#8217;s founder and CEO Pony Ma says in one of his proposals, according to a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UhD7GBQiU_FsBYZ-bA9sAg">report</a> from the state-backed People’s Posts and Telecommunications News. As a delegate of the National People&#8217;s Congress, Ma has submitted more than 50 proposals during the parliament meetings over nine consecutive years, said the report.</p>
<p>Specifically, Ma calls for strict governance on peer-to-peer finance, bike sharing, long-term apartment rental and online grocery group-buying, fledgling areas that have also seen businesses go bust amid cash-hemorrhaging competition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ma&#8217;s comment comes at a time when regulators are tightening their grips on the country&#8217;s tech giants. In recent months, the government has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">launched probes into Alibaba</a> and other tech firms over anti-competitive practices and proposed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/chinas-internet-regulator-takes-aim-at-forced-data-collection/">a sweeping data law</a> that will limit how platforms collect user information.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fUE1jt2SsW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">China&#8217;s e-commerce titan Alibaba hit with antitrust probe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s e-commerce titan Alibaba hit with antitrust probe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/embed/#?secret=fUE1jt2SsW" data-secret="fUE1jt2SsW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h3>Lei Jun</h3>
<p>In China&#8217;s grand plan to move up the manufacturing value chain, Xiaomi, which makes smartphones and a slew of other hardware devices, has been keen to help factories upgrade.</p>
<p>Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, a delegate of the NPC, recognizes China is late to smart manufacturing, lacks home-grown innovation and is over-reliant on foreign technologies, he says in his <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/xC1AvwdjzyEbFGaOryitCA">proposal</a>. Research and development efforts should be directed to key components such as cutting-edge sensors and precision reducers for factory robots, he says.</p>
<p>China also lacks the talent for advancing factory innovation, Lei points out, thus government policies should support corporations in attracting foreign talent and cultivating collaboration between industries and academia.</p>
<h3>Robin Li</h3>
<p>As part of its artificial intelligence pivot, Baidu, China&#8217;s biggest search engine service, has invested heavily in smart-driving tech. Regulation is a major hurdle for autonomous driving firms like Baidu that need large volumes of data to train algorithms, and the rate at which testing permits are issued varies greatly across regions.</p>
<p>Robin Li, CEO of Baidu and a member of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference, <a href="https://weibo.com/2525235360/K4se88o2o?refer_flag=1001030103_&amp;type=comment#_rnd1614923758760">urges</a> regulators to be more innovative and pave the way for legal and at-scale commercialization of autonomous driving. A mechanism should be created for various government agencies, industry players and academia to collectively promote the commercial deployment of autonomous driving.</p>
<p>In addition, Li calls for more senior-friendly technologies, greater public access to government data, and better online protection for underage users in China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sicepat.com/">SiCepat</a>, an end-to-end logistics startup in Indonesia, announced today it has raised a $170 million Series B funding round. Founded in 2014 to provide last-mile deliveries for small merchants, the company has since expanded to serve large e-commerce platforms, too. Its services now also cover warehousing and fulfillment, middle-mile logistics and online distribution.</p>
<p>Investors in SiCepat&#8217;s Series B include Falcon House Partners, Kejora Capital, DEG (the German Development Finance Institution), Telkom Indonesia’s investment arm MDI Ventures, Indies Capital, Temasek Holdings subsidiary Pavilion Capital, Trihill Capital, and Daiwa Securities. The company’s last funding announcement was a <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/indonesian-logistics-startup-raised-southeast-asias-largest-series-rounds-50m">$50 million Series A in April 2019</a>.</p>
<p>In a press statement, The Kim Hai, founder and chief executive officer of SiCepat&#8217;s parent company Onstar Express, said the funding will be used to &#8220;further fortify SiCepat&#8217;s position as the leading end-to-end logistics service provider in the Indonesian market and potentially to explore expansion to other markets in Southeast Asia.&#8221; SiCepat claims to be profitable already and says that it was able to fulfill more than 1.4 million packages per day in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The logistics industry in Indonesia is <a href="http://www.gbgindonesia.com/en/services/article/2013/indonesia_s_logistics_sector.php">highly fragmented</a>, which means higher costs for businesses. At the same time, demand for deliveries is increasing thanks to the growth of e-commerce, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>SiCepat is one of several Indonesian startups that have raised funding recently to make the supply chain and logistics infrastructure more efficient. For example, earlier this week, supply chain SaaS provider Advotics announced a $2.75 million round. Other notable startups in the space include Kargo, founded by a former Uber Asia executive, and Waresix.</p>

<p>SiCepat focuses in particular on e-commerce and social commerce, or people who sell goods through their social media networks. In a statement, Kejora Capital managing partner Sebastian Togelang said the Indonesian e-commerce market is expected to grow at five-year compounded annual growth rate of 21%, reaching $82 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe SiCepat is ideally positioned to serve customers from e-commerce giants to uprising social commerce players which contribute an estimated 25% to the total digital commerce economy,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>Insurance agents spend hours handling paperwork and grabbing client information over the phone. A new seed-stage startup, <a href="https://www.insurgrid.com/">InsurGrid</a>, has developed a software solution to help ease the process, and make it easier for agents to serve existing clients &#8212; and secure new ones.</p>
<p>InsurGrid gives agents a personalized platform to collect information from clients, such as date of birth, driver’s license information and policy declaration. This platform helps agents avoid sitting on long calls or managing back-to-back emails, and instead gives them one spot to understand how all their different clients function. It is starting with property and casualty management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup integrates with 85 insurance carriers, serving as the software layer instead of the provider. Using the InsurGrid platform, insurers can ask clients to upload information and within seconds be registered as a policyholder. This essentially turns into a living Rolodex that insurers can use to access information on the account, and offer quotes on a faster rate.</p>

<p>There’s a monetary benefit in providing better service. Eden Insurance, a customer of InsurGrid, said that people who submit information through the platform converted at an 82% higher rate than those who don’t. Jeremy Eden, the agency owner of Eden Insurance, said they were able to show consumers that its plan was $300 cheaper than its existing rate.</p>
<p>At the heart of InsurGrid is a bet from the founding team that legacy insurance agents aren’t going anywhere. Co-founder/CEO Chase Beach pointed out that the majority of the $684 billion of annual property and casualty insurance premiums in the United States is distributed by approximately 800,000 agents working in 16,000 brokerages. So far, InsurGrid works with more than 150 of those agencies.</p>
<p>When asked if InsurGrid ever had plans to offer its own insurance, similar to insurtech giants Hippo, Lemonade and Root, Beach said that it is solely working on innovating around the sales process for now. He said that these big companies, which have either recently gone public or are planning to, still rely on agents to be successful.</p>
<p>“Instead of us replacing the insurance agent, what if we gave them that same level of technology of a Hippo or large carrier,” Beach said. “And provide them with the digital experiences so they can compete in 2021.”</p>
<p>As time goes on, he sees insurance agents taking the same role that financial advisors or real estate agents take: “very much involved in the process because they are that expert.”</p>
<p>Other startups that have popped up in this space include Gabi, Trellis and Canopy Connect. The differentiator, the team sees, is that Beach comes from a 144-year-old insurance legacy, giving him key insights on how to sell to agents in a successful and effective way. It is starting with sales, but expect InsurGrid to expand to other parts of the insurance process as well.</p>
<p>To help them compete with new and old startups, InsurGrid recently raised $1.3 million in pre-seed financing to help it fulfill its goal to be the “underdog for the underdogs,” Beach said. Investors include Engineering Capital, Hustle Fund, Vess Capital, Sahil Lavingia and Trevor Kienzle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.dijanow.com/">Dija</a>, the London-based grocery delivery startup, is officially launching today and confirming that it raised £20 million in seed funding in December &#8212; a round that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/dija/">we first reported</a> was partially closed the previous month.</p>
<p>Backing the company is Blossom Capital, Creandum and Index Ventures, with Dija seemingly able to raise pre-launch. In fact, there are already rumours swirling around London&#8217;s venture capital community that the upstart may be out raising again already &#8212; a figure up to £100 million was mooted by one source &#8212; as the race to become the early European leader in the burgeoning &#8220;dark&#8221; grocery store space heats up.<br />

<p>Over the last few months, a host of European startups have launched with the promise of delivering grocery and other convenience store items within 10-15 minutes of ordering. They do this by building out their own hyper-local, delivery-only fulfilment centres &#8212; so-called &#8220;dark stores&#8221; &#8212; and recruiting their own delivery personnel. This full-stack or vertical approach and the visibility it provides is then supposed to produce enough supply chain and logistics efficiency to make the unit economics work, although that part is far from proven.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this week, Berlin-based Flink announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">raised $52 million in seed financing</a> in a mixture of equity and debt. The company didn&#8217;t break out the equity-debt split, though one source told me the equity component was roughly half and half.</p>
<p>Others in the space include Berlin’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, London’s Jiffy and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, and France’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/cajoo-promises-grocery-deliveries-in-15-minutes/">Cajoo</a>, all of which also claim to focus on fresh food and groceries. There’s also the likes of <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, which is still in stealth and more focused on a potentially higher-margin convenience store offering similar to U.S. unicorn goPuff. Related: goPuff itself is also looking to expand into Europe and is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">in talks to acquire or invest in the U.K.’s Fancy</a>, which some have dubbed a mini goPuff.</p>

<p>However, let&#8217;s get back to Dija. Founded by Alberto Menolascina and Yusuf Saban, who both spent a number of years at Deliveroo in senior positions, the company has opened up shop in central London and promises to let you order groceries and other convenience products within 10 minutes. It has hubs in South Kensington, Fulham and Hackney, and says it plans to open 20 further hubs, covering central London and Zone 2, by the summer. Each hub carries around 2,000 products, claiming to be sold at &#8220;recommended retail prices&#8221;. A flat delivery fee of £1.99 is charged per order.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only competitors that we are focused on are the large supermarket chains who dominate a global $12 trillion industry,&#8221; Dija&#8217;s Menolascina tells me when I ask about competitors. &#8220;What really sets us apart from them, besides our speed and technology, is our team, who all have a background in growing and disrupting this industry, including myself and Yusuf, who built and scaled Deliveroo from the ground up&#8221;.</p>
<p>Menolascina was previously director of Corporate Strategy and Development at the takeout delivery behemoth and held several positions before that. He also co-founded Everli (formerly Supermercato24), the Instacart-styled grocery delivery company in Italy, and also worked at Just Eat. Saban is the former chief of staff to CEO at Deliveroo and also worked at investment bank Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>During Dija&#8217;s soft-launch, Menolascina says that typical customers have been doing their weekly food shop using the app, and also fulfilling other needs, such as last-minute emergencies or late night cravings. &#8220;The pain points Dija is helping to solve are universal and we built Dija to be accessible to everyone,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It’s why we offer products at retail prices, available in 10 minutes &#8212; combining value and convenience. Already, Dija is becoming a key service for parents who are pressed for time working from home and homeschooling, as one example&#8221;.</p>
<p>Despite the millions of dollars being pumped into the space, a number of VCs I&#8217;ve spoken to privately are skeptical that fresh groceries with near instant delivery can be made to work. The thinking is that fresh food perishes, margins are lower and basket sizes won&#8217;t be large enough to cover the costs of delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be the case for other companies, but almost everyone at Dija comes from this industry and knows exactly what they are doing, from buying and merchandising to data and marketing,&#8221; Menolascina says, pushing back. &#8220;It’s also worth pointing out that we are a full-stack model, so we’re not sharing our margin with other parties. In terms of the average basket size, it varies depending on the customer&#8217;s need. On one hand, we have customers who do their entire grocery shop through Dija, while on the other hand, our customers depend on us for emergency purchases e.g. nappies, batteries etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>On pricing, he says that, like any retail business, Dija buys products at wholesale prices and sells them at recommended retail prices. &#8220;Going forward, we have a clear roadmap on how we generate additional revenue, including strategic partnerships, supply chain optimisation and technology enhancements,&#8221; adds Menolascina.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, TechCrunch has learned that prior to launching its own app, Dija ran a number of experiments on takeout marketplace Deliveroo, including selling various convenience store items, such as potato chips and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. If you&#8217;ve ever ordered toiletry products from &#8220;Baby &amp; Me Pharmacy&#8221; or purchased chocolate sweets from &#8220;Valentine&#8217;s Vows,&#8221; you have likely and unknowingly shopped at Dija. Those brands, and a number of others, all delivered from the same address in South Kensington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going direct to consumer without properly testing pick &amp; pack is a big risk,&#8221; Menolascina told me in a WhatsApp message a few weeks ago, confirming the Deliveroo tests. &#8220;We created disposable virtual brands purely to learn what to sell and how to replenish, pick &amp; pack, and deliver&#8221;.</p>
