										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loyalty, deals and rewards services are a rarity in most African markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unit economics and other factors such as currency instability make such businesses hard to pull off in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, <a href="https://thankucash.com/">ThankUCash</a>, a platform launched in 2018 by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/company/connectedanalytics">Connected Analytics</a>, has managed to thrive, proving that not all is gloom in the deals, coupon and rewards business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And to that end, the startup, which announced an undisclosed seven-figure seed last year, has finally closed the round at $5.3 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VC firms 500 Global and Unicorn Growth Capital co-led the Lagos-based company’s seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It saw participation from U.S.-based accelerator Expert Dojo, Predictive VC, SaaS Growth Ventures, Betatron Venture Group, Accelerex Holdings. Individual investors like Andrew Dell, former CEO of HSBC and Craig Fenton of Google UK also took part.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255422" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use the investment to expand within its home market Nigeria &#8212; where it operates in Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja &#8212; and outside to Ghana and Kenya. It also wants to improve its product offerings and add more staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, store-like businesses in Nigeria such as supermarkets and restaurants have operated offline, relying on bookkeeping and head knowledge to record their customers’ activities in their shops. This made it difficult to offer cash back and loyalty points to customers</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online platforms like ThankUCash present these merchants with an opportunity to delve into rewards and help them retain loyalty and increase revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/simeonononobi">Simeon Ononobi</a> started ThankUCash with Suraj Supekar, Madonna Ononobi and Harshal Gandole, who act as a chief technical officer, chief operating officer and senior vice president of engineering, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multi-merchant rewards platform (which means customers can hop on from one merchant to another to earn loyalty points in another) allows customers to earn rewards anytime they shop with thousands of merchants listed on its app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business raised a $320,000 pre-seed after grabbing the <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/02/12/thankucash-accepted-into-500-startups/">attention of accelerators</a> such as 500 Startups, Google Launchpad and other local investors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/">Microtraction</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/ventures-platform-announces-first-close-of-its-40m-pan-african-fund/">Ventures Platform</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until this point, ThankUCash said it has recorded over 600,000 users and onboarded over 1,000 stores on its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, it claims to have processed over $80 million in transaction volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having matured as a business, Ononobi and his team want to take on a more complicated task: building infrastructure for companies that want to offer akin services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are creating solutions that help SMEs succeed while increasing consumer buying power and opportunities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to build an infrastructure for rewards, loyalty, deals, buy now, pay later, cashback,” he said to TechCrunch on a call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cashback was our low hanging fruit and an entry point. We’re still going to go into deals, couponing, gift cards, buy now, pay later, anything that will help the business grow, but at the same time, allowing the consumer increase in opportunities of buying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ononobi, a serial entrepreneur who previously built a payments company and also apps for Nigerian banks and the government, reckons that ThankUCash will do to rewards the same thing Flutterwave and Paystack did to payments in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies such as banks have launched cashback programs via debit cards to users in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But most of them have been generally inefficient, from setup down to collections and redeeming of points, and Ononobi argues that their inefficiencies boil down to no technical support. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThankUCash sees a gold mine to provide plugins banks and fintechs can tap into to offer cashback and rewards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255432" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255432" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2255432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-co-founders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-co-founders.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-co-founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-co-founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-co-founders.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-co-founders.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-co-founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255432" class="wp-caption-text">ThankUCash co-founders</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bit about buy now, pay later is fuzzy now since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/will-carbon-and-shahry-usher-in-a-wave-of-buy-now-pay-later-services-in-africa/">only a handful of prominent BNPL services</a> in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company seems to be positioning itself for the imminent proliferation of such services buoyed by similar happenings globally where buy now, pay later services have seen an uptake as a result of pandemic-induced consumer behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The technology is such that we have our machines in stores. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So as customers request loans, we generate a code for it, customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The code can only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested, such that at the end of the day the customer is buying straight from the merchants,” explained the founder, who also mentioned that his startup might venture into offering buy now, pay later services itself in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThankUCash’s consumer-facing platform will remain operational. But to set the infrastructure play in motion, it has signed a partnership with payments company Interswitch to onboard its merchants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which is also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the process of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making integrations with payments gateways, said a couple of bank partnerships are in its pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of how ThankUCash makes money, merchants pay the company a fee on every </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made in their stores. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, ThankUCash gets a 1.5% commission for every customer it brings into the store to redeem a 5% cashback item. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lagos-based company also takes commissions for deals and plans to charge a “heavy onboarding fee” for businesses that want to use its APIs for its services, including buy now, pay later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThankUCash has perfected one offering: the cashback product where merchants can get more walk-in customers. It’s improving the deals category, allowing merchants to sell products fast </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(by hiring <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/11/22/ex-dealdey-managers-reunite-to-launch-thankucash-deals/">ex-managers of DealDey</a>, a Nigerian defunct deals company). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while currently building out its buy now pay later infrastructure (which gives businesses a chance to sell products regardless of whether customers have money or not), ThankUCash plans to add a fourth offering soon: a remittance product where merchants can sell </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the diaspora.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chief executive doesn’t give details about this product. Meanwhile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its investors, who have doubled down while privy to information like this, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are enthused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about “the continued evolution of the company”, a remark made by Amit Bhatti, the principal at co-lead investor 500 Global.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since going through 500 Global’s accelerator in 2019, we’ve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been impressed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Simeon and the ThankUCash team’s progress in implementing a rewards system that works for Nigerian consumers, regardless of cash or credit or online or offline payment,” said the principal. “It’s a win-win for businesses and banks, too, as TUC gives them the tools and data they need to grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 45-man team has hired Aaron Tindiseega to lead its expansion into Kenya and the eastern Africa region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ugandan professional has experience working for banks and tech companies like Uber, Standard Chartered Bank and Stanbic IBTC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For its expansion into Ghana, Kiki Anku, who has worked at Apple and a couple of startups, will spearhead the task.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.ankorstore.com">Ankorstore</a> has raised a $283 million Series C funding round (€250 million). Founded in November 2019, it took Ankorstore around two years to reach a post-money valuation of $2 billion (€1.75 billion). The company operates a wholesale marketplace for independent retailers across Europe.</p>
<p>Ankorstore lets independent brands sell their products to independent retailers. Those retailers can then sell those products to their own customers. It’s a B2B2C play with a focus on offline sales at the end of the chain.</p>
<p>You can find a bit of everything on Ankorstore, from household supplies to maple syrup, candles, headbands, bath salts and stationery items. Some verticals have been working quite well in particular, such as non-perishable groceries, beauty products and items for your home.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254596" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And it’s been working extremely well given the company’s trajectory. There are currently 200,000 retailers using the marketplace and sourcing items from 15,000 brands. In May 2021, when Ankorstore <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/ankorstore-raises-another-102-million-for-its-wholesale-marketplace/">raised its Series B</a>, the company told me it was working with 50,000 shops and 5,000 brands.</p>
<p>This leads us to today’s funding round. Bond and Tiger Global led the Series C. Eurazeo and Coatue also participated in the round. Some existing investors put more money on the table, such as Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, GFC, Alven and Aglae Ventures.</p>
<p>There aren’t a lot of companies competing in the space. The best known wholesale marketplace is probably <a href="https://www.faire.com">Faire</a>, a U.S.-based company that has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/indigo-fair">over $1 billion</a> — it has recently started its <a href="https://blog.faire.com/thestudio/faire-has-expanded-in-europe-to-15-countries/">European expansion</a>. <a href="https://www.creoate.com">Creoate</a> and <a href="https://www.orderchamp.com">Orderchamp</a> also operate wholesale marketplaces in Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>A marketplace without inventory</h2>
<p>Ankorstore has teams in five countries — France, the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. It sells products in 23 European markets. Retailers can pay up to 60 days after ordering something and there are no hidden fees for them. Essentially, Ankorstore helps retailers focus on curation, service while the startup takes care of procurement.</p>
<p>As for brands listing their items on Ankorstore, they give a 10% cut on each transaction following a higher 20% cut on the first order through Ankorstore.</p>
<p>Some brands still have direct deals with massive retailers, such as department stores. And Ankorstore doesn’t prevent brands from hiring sales people, going to fairs, etc. The marketplace is just another sales channel and another opportunity to find customers.</p>
<p>And this is the beauty of the business model of wholesale marketplaces. Ankorstore doesn’t have any warehouse and doesn’t own any inventory. The company only facilitates transactions between brands and retailers without any capital investment.</p>
<p>“We think we’re closer to LinkedIn in the way we operate — it’s a network of professionals and we help them connect with each other,” co-founder and co-CEO Nicolas Cohen told me.</p>
<p>And like all social networks, there are some strong network effects as the platform gets bigger. In particular, Ankorstore expects to expand to new categories, such as perishable food.</p>
<p>The startup already has a deal with UPS to help brands with shipping. But the company hasn’t done much when it comes to warehousing solutions for small brands. That’s another opportunity down the road.</p>
<p>With 400 employees and a lot of money in its bank account, Ankorstore could act as the unifying layer of this highly fragmented industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFv9NTMEHNM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Here we go with the last show of 2021, recorded in mid-December. It was Frank Radice’s last show from New York before he returned to London. It was nice to bid the year goodbye, but we were careful not to say good riddance like we did in 2020. It was nice to feel good about the Zoom-connected friendships we nurtured, and nice to appreciate the flow of working from anywhere and yet still being productive.</p>
<p>For me, the heartbeat of tech and its impact on so many things we struggle with — politics, streaming, and the media business — was and remains palpable. It may be that crypto will find its moment, but I wouldn’t gamble on it. The midterms loom, and social networks are turning topsy-TicTok and live audio, but I wouldn’t bet on the kind of numbers that will turn Wall Street on quite yet if at all. Newsletters are looking more and more like publishers, and publishers are going startup to head it off at the pass, but it will take talent not venture money to make it stick.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255448" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Not since Bill Gates and the Google twins ruled the world have we seen such a shift in the stars that define the nighttime skies. Dorsey, who invented Twitter as a side project, and Andreessen, who sped up thinking from 1X to at least 2X, are skating ahead of the curve now, more aligned than the media wants them to be. Television is gone, replaced by a hybrid of computer, mobile, and small movies that will survive the machine movie behemoths of the fifties. The Beatles are now the old guard, struggling with the transition from children to parents to divorce and rebirth. The more footage we resuscitate, the more we realize what an incredible courageous process they opened to the doors of our perception. Only they were too big to fail and did anyway, and even then let us see how far collaboration can go. As James Taylor echoed:</p>
<p>Just shower the people you love with love<br />
Show them the way that you feel<br />
Things are gonna work out fine<br />
If you only will<br />
Do as I say</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What if the auto industry&#8217;s best solution to the chip shortage was not simply making more chips? Suppose we instead got a handle on what might be called &#8220;feature bloat&#8221; — the tendency, fueled by sales competition, to slather new cars with as much technology as possible?</p>
<p>Surveys show that consumers want — and expect — that their next car will be laden with whiz-bang features, demand that is a driver for the current bloat. CES 2022, which wrapped this week, provides a glimpse of what the future car might hold. Bosch said to expect double-digit annual growth in automotive software until 2030; Panasonic showed off an augmented reality head-up display with eye tracking, plus the ELS Studio 3D audio system with 1,000 watts and 25 speakers. BMW unveiled future technology that will allow owners to change the exterior color of their cars and display digital art inside them, not to mention a rear 31-inch Theatre Screen with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/amazon-fire-tv-is-coming-to-more-cars-in-2022/">built-in Amazon Fire TV</a>.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just a tiny sampling of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ces-2022-best-weirdest-car-tech/">car tech shown at CES 2022.</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252070" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But if that tech is unreliable — as some of it has proven — then it&#8217;s not a win for consumers. Meanwhile, market reality has resulted in a collision course for buyers on the ground: higher prices and spotty availability of some of the features they say they most want.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a chip shortage; we have software bloat,&#8221; said Mike Juran, CEO and co-founder of Altia, which provides graphical user interface design and tools to many automakers. &#8220;There is way too much unnecessary software out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take the Chevrolet Volt. The plug-in hybrid had more than 10 million lines of code when it was introduced for the 2011 model year;  today&#8217;s mid- to high-level vehicles have something like 100 million lines, said Michael Hill, vice president of engineering at Altia.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s at the level you might have seen in a jet fighter 10 or 15 years ago,&#8221; Hill told TechCrunch. &#8220;And there is no bug-free software.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bad news for consumers: the feature bloat is unavoidable and getting worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s cars are being burdened with features consumers aren&#8217;t necessarily asking for or demanding,&#8221; Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>According to Fisher, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/media-room/press-releases/2021/11/consumer-reports-new-annual-auto-reliability-data-reveals-safest-bets-and-riskiest-choices-among-new-vehicles/">CR&#8217;s 2021 Auto Reliability Report</a> found that high-end electric SUVs are among the least-reliable vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not because their powertrains are problematic,&#8221; Fisher said. &#8220;Instead, automakers saw an opening with the early EV adopters to package the cars with all the technology they could come up with. They&#8217;re trying to differentiate the product&#8211;and justify the high cost. And that results in cars that aren&#8217;t very reliable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buggy software caused by inefficiency and coding problems are being driven by a shift — or more accurately, an acceleration — in the vehicle development cycle, according to Jason Williamson, vice president of marketing at Altia.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are used to seeing new phones every year, and automakers are trying to keep up with consumer electronics,&#8221; Williamson said. &#8220;They&#8217;re pushing to develop completely new cars in two years or less. And that means using building blocks that are maybe intended for laptops and not necessarily custom-built for automotive applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only expensive EVs that are enticing consumers with tech; it&#8217;s happening in many mid- and upscale product lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more feature bloat than software bloat,&#8221; said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for e-mobility at Guidehouse Insights. &#8220;The software is only there to make all the features work, and do we really need 30-way power adjustable seats with five massage-pattern options? Or sequential taillights, multi-zone automatic climate control and audio systems with concert hall and studio settings? The insatiable desire to one-up the competition is what&#8217;s driving this.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The crux for automakers</h2>
<p>Automakers that take the all-tech-is-good-tech option avoids the trickier, yet ultimately smarter approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hardest thing is to figure out what the feature set should be and stick to it,&#8221; said Mike Bell, senior vice president of digital at Lucid Group. &#8220;It can be easier to say, &#8216;We&#8217;re not sure what we&#8217;re doing, so we&#8217;re just going to throw in the whole kitchen sink.&#8217; The smart approach is to decide what customers actually want to do, then figure out how to give them the best experience. There shouldn&#8217;t be seven ways to do something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bell spent nearly 17 years at Apple, and recruited part of his Lucid tech team from there. He said one source of problems is that, contrary to tech company norms, automakers contract much of their software work out to suppliers. &#8220;You can&#8217;t farm it out and expect to have a good experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At Lucid, instead of buying from the tier whatevers, we do our own software and our own integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Automakers are beginning to acknowledge the new tech dominance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Launching a car now is not just about the hardware, but about the software, too&#8221; according to Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath.  He added in an interview that the ability to do over-the-air updates of that software &#8220;makes a big difference in consumer satisfaction. We can quickly respond to issues that come up.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Great expectations</h2>
<p>A major factor here is consumer expectations. It&#8217;s true that auto buyers don&#8217;t need certain features, but they do appear to want them. A November <a href="https://www.copilotsearch.com/">study from CoPilot,</a> a data-driven car-buying app, suggests that automakers are simply responding to public demand. It found that 65.7% of current lease holders expect better feature functionality in their next car or truck, and slightly more than 56% think they&#8217;ll pay about the same or less than they do for their current vehicle.</p>
<p>Similarly, a September <a href="https://www.carmax.com/articles/most-used-and-popular-car-tech-features">CarMax survey</a> of more than 1,000 car owners found that almost 50% &#8220;said they wish their current car had more tech features.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buyers in their 20s and 30s, a highly desirable demographic for automakers, were the most likely to say that tech features were &#8220;extremely important&#8221; to them as a purchase consideration. Overall, 15.9% considered the tech package extremely important; 36.7% saw it as very important; and 31.8% were in the &#8220;somewhat important&#8221; camp. Only 3.9% said it was &#8220;not at all&#8221; important.</p>
<p>Given the chip shortage, tech expectations are not likely to be met.</p>
<p>Pat Ryan, CEO and founder of CoPilot, said in an interview that consumers are likely on a collision course in three areas. &#8220;First, it may take three to six months just to get a car, and people aren&#8217;t used to that,&#8221; Ryan said. &#8220;The second issue is that shoppers may find that their new car actually has fewer features than the one they&#8217;re turning in.</p>
<p>Premium sound, wireless charging, even heated seats may not be available because of the chip shortage. And people used to paying maybe 95% of the sticker price may find themselves hit with stickerplus.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the desire for high-tech cars is not likely to go away. Jessica Caldwell, executive director, Insights, at Edmunds, told TechCrunch that automakers are touting their cars and trucks as multi-purpose offices and living spaces on wheels, and buyers are appreciative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers are enjoying the growing number of features and amenities, and most importantly are willing to pay for these highly contented vehicles,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The chip shortage has made it challenging to produce models with more options and features, but the consumer interest is still there. And as long as there&#8217;s a consumer appetite, automakers will find a way to feed it for the sake of their own profits and market share.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">From turkeys to gasoline, clothes to dollar stores, nearly every avenue of human activity has been hit by the specter of inflation. Across the globe, rising inflation rates are disrupting purchasing plans and spending.</p>
<p>In the face of this inflationary inferno, consumers and institutions holding devaluing fiat currency have sought out alternatives to hedge against. Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are the current weapons of choice, driving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to embrace crypto as an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/gemini-executive-very-bullish-on-pure-play-bitcoin-etf-in-early-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investable asset class</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has witnessed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/dogecoin-is-not-good-for-the-crypto-market-ripple-ceo-says.html?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Node%20Nov%2023&amp;utm_term=The%20Node%5C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong year-to-date returns</a>, outshining traditional hedges by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/bitcoin-vs-gold-leading-gold-authorities-on-inflation-hedge-battle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rallying</a> over 130% compared to gold’s meager 4%. In addition, increased <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/bitcoin-btc-rally-partly-driven-by-more-institutional-investors-pwc-says.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">institutional adoption</a>, sustained appetite for digital assets based on <a href="https://medium.com/coinshares/volume-57-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-28ae929f9c31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly inflows</a> and growing exposure in the media strengthened bitcoin’s case among weary investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255073" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If these are the moves being made by big money, they must be smart moves. However, while the prospect of hedging against bitcoin may seem enticing to retail investors, certain lingering question marks remain over its viability in mitigating financial risk for individuals.</p>
<h2>Miscalculated expectations</h2>
<p>The ongoing discussion of bitcoin as an inflation hedge needs to be prefaced with the fact that the currency is often susceptible to market jitters and gyrations: Bitcoin’s value plummeted over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/bitcoin-crypto-crashed-hard/">80%</a> during December 2017, by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/bitcoin-loses-half-of-its-value-in-two-day-plunge.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> in March 2020 and by another <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-price-2021-gains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53%</a> in May 2021.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s ability to improve user returns and reduce volatility over the long term has yet to be proven. Traditional hedges like gold have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/bitcoin-vs-gold-leading-gold-authorities-on-inflation-hedge-battle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated efficacy</a> in preserving purchasing power during periods of sustained high inflation — take the U.S.<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/1970s-great-inflation.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> during the 1970s</a> as an example — something bitcoin has yet to be tested on. This increased risk, in turn, makes returns subject to the drastic short-term swings that sometimes affect the currency.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			 It’s far too early to be making judgments on bitcoin being an effective hedge.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Many make the argument for bitcoin based on the fact that it’s designed for a limited supply, which supposedly protects it from devaluation compared to traditional fiat currencies. While this makes sense in theory, bitcoin’s price has been shown to be vulnerable to external influences. Bitcoin “whales” are known for their ability to manipulate prices by selling or buying in large quantities, meaning that bitcoin can be dictated by speculative forces, not solely the money-supply rule.</p>
<p>Another key consideration is regulation: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still at the mercy of regulators and wildly varying laws across jurisdictions. Anti-competitive laws and shortsighted regulations could significantly hamper the adoption of the underlying technology, potentially depreciating the asset’s price further. All this is to say one thing: It’s far too early to be making judgments on bitcoin being an effective hedge.</p>
<h2>Catering to the rich</h2>
<p>Against the background of this debate, another salient trend has been driving its momentum. As bitcoin’s popularity grows, it continues to drive adoption and institutionalization of the currency among consumers, including several wealthy individuals and corporations.</p>
<p>A recent survey found that <a href="https://ifamagazine.com/article/wisdom-tree-nearly-half-of-advised-uk-investors-look-to-independently-invest-in-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72% of U.K. financial advisers</a> have briefed their clients about investing in crypto, with nearly half of the advisers saying they believed crypto could be used to diversify portfolios as an uncorrelated asset.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There has also been a great deal of bitcoin advocacy from prolific individuals, known for being technologically progressive, namely billionaire Wall Street investor <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/paul-tudor-jones-says-crypto-is-his-preferred-inflation-hedge-over-gold-right-now.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Tudor,</a> Twitter CEO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/09/17/billionaire-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-reveals-why-bitcoin-is-the-best-internet-currency/?sh=3efcf9a6439e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Dorsey</a>, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-trade-of-the-century-predict-30x-gain-2020-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Winklevoss twins</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/novogratz-sees-bitcoin-at-100-000-with-every-company-adopting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Novogratz</a>. Even powerful companies such as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/bitcoin-goldman-sachs-ramps-up-trading-in-partnership-with-mike-novogratz-galaxy-digital.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="https://decrypt.co/86820/morgan-stanley-grayscale-bitcoin-shares-heavy-discount" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morgan Stanley</a> have expressed their interest in bitcoin as a viable asset.</p>
<p>If this momentum continues, bitcoin’s infamous volatility will gradually dissipate as more and more wealthy people and institutions hold the currency. Ironically, this accrual of value on the network would lead to the concentration of wealth — the antithesis of what bitcoin was created for, subject to the influence of the elite and exclusive <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1212/average-net-worth-of-the-1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1%</a>.</p>
<p>In line with classical schools of financial thought, this would actually expose retail investors to greater risk, as institutional buying and selling would resemble whale-like market manipulations.</p>
<h2>Defying the core ethos</h2>
<p>Bitcoin’s growing popularity will no doubt lead to more people owning it, and one can argue that the people with the most money will be the ones who are going to (as usual) end up owning most of it.</p>
<p>This noticeable shift of influence toward ultra-high-net-worth individuals and firms among bitcoin and other crypto circles goes against the very ethos that the Bitcoin white paper was based upon when it described a <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peer-to-peer electronic cash system</a>.</p>
<p>Among the <a href="https://blog.coinfund.io/what-we-look-for-the-9-core-value-propositions-of-crypto-networks-88b04d09d873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundamental rationales</a> for cryptocurrencies is their need to be permissionless and <a href="https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/exploring-bitcoins-core-values-and-why-we-defend-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resistant to censorship</a> and control by any given institution.</p>
<p>Now, as the 1% seeks a greater slice of the crypto pie, they boost the prices of these assets in the short term in a way that traditional and less influential retail investors are unable to.</p>
<p>While this move would undoubtedly make a few wealthier, there is an argument to be made that this might leave the market at the mercy of the 1%, contradicting Bitcoin’s intended vision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> out this week. App Annie says global spending across iOS and Google Play is up to $135 billion in 2021, and that figure will likely be higher when its annual report, including third-party app stores in China, is released next year. Consumers also downloaded 10 billion more apps this year than in 2020, reaching nearly 140 billion in new installs, it found.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that was up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254994" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3>Instagram to bring back the chronological feed</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2188260" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188260" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188260" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg 1611w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188260" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/instagram-chronological-feed/">said it will begin testing a new feature</a> that will allow users to select between three different feeds: the current algorithmically generated timeline as well as two new options, Favorites and Following, which are sorted chronologically. This is similar to the Recent &amp; Favorites section that Facebook today offers &#8212; though that version is buried in the app&#8217;s More menu, making it difficult to access. It&#8217;s unclear how easy it will be to access Instagram&#8217;s new feed options &#8212; especially given the app&#8217;s growing clutter and strategic priorities. The latter even saw Instagram shifting its critical &#8220;post&#8221; button to an out-of-reach spot to give the prime real estate in the app&#8217;s navigation to Instagram&#8217;s Reels instead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feed changes were announced following a Senate hearing where Instagram head Adam Mosseri testified for the first time. The hearing had focused on the app&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">teen safety track record</a> but often branched into other areas, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-says-teen-accounts-created-on-the-web-dont-default-to-private/">like user privacy</a>, and to what extent users were being &#8220;manipulated by algorithms,&#8221; as one Senator put it. Mosseri had then responded by saying the company was developing a feature that would allow consumers to choose to view a chronological feed. In other words, it&#8217;s likely this &#8220;test&#8221; will soon evolve into a public-facing feature for all users, in order to deflect further pressure from Congress over the matter.</p>
<p>Although users have clamored for an option or full-on return to a chronological feed for some time, Instagram ignored those demands until now &#8212; when it&#8217;s a topic of legislative inquiry. That fact indicates the need for increased tech regulations as it proves companies won&#8217;t listen to user demands unless pressured to do so.</p>
<h3>South Korea blocks new &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; (P2E) games</h3>
<p>The South Korean government&#8217;s Game Management Committee in the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism (or GMC for short) has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/korean-government-tells-apple-and-google-stores-to-take-down-p2e-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked the major app stores to block any games</a> that require an in-app purchase before users play. The games, which have become popular in the crypto industry, often require that players first purchase game pieces as NFT. Players can then compete for in-game rewards and prizes, giving them the name &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; (or P2E). The GMC said it asked the app stores to remove the existing P2E games on the market and block the release of new ones.</p>
<p>The changes follow other difficulties for these types of games in South Korea, which have been battling in the courts to get age ratings required to be listed in the domestic app stores. The government limits in-game rewards to 10,000 Korean won (~$8.40), but some of the games&#8217; cashouts exceed that figure but were being listed anyway &#8212; which would technically be illegal.</p>
<p>The government views this genre of gaming as a money-making scheme and is now taking a harsher stance to get them removed from the app stores and out of kids&#8217; hands, in particular. In addition to penalizing games themselves, the new restrictions may impact other titles associated with <a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games</a> in this genre, like those tied to games like Axie Infinity and Splinterlands.</p>

Later this year, Chromebook owners will also be able to instantly set up their devices using an Android handset to port over their data and logins. Smartwatches running Wear OS 3 will also be able to unlock Android phones and Chromebooks, the way Apple Watch works today. Plus, Windows PCs and Android <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/google-brings-android-and-some-windows-pcs-closer-together/">will also work more closely</a>, Google says.</li>
<li><strong>Google also at CES introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/google-home-youtube-integrate-with-volvo-cars/">new integration with Volvo</a> </strong>which will allow owners to do things like turn their car on and off, control the temperature, and get car information using voice commands on Google Assistant-enabled home and Android mobile devices.</li>

Amazon is still No. 1 in the U.S., however.</li>

This is maybe even more impressive than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen/">that Disney filter</a>?</li>

<h2>Fintech/Crypto</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Messaging app Signal&#8217;s cryptocurrency feature seemed to have quietly launched to worldwide users</strong> in mid-November, but was only picked up on this past week. The feature, which was previously being tested in the U.K., integrates with a privacy-focused cryptocurrency called MobileCoin. Signal users can now send MobileCoin to others in the app worldwide. MobileCoin founder Josh Goldbard <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-cryptocurrency-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed the rollout to Wired</a>, noting Signal&#8217;s adoption helped the cryptocurrency jump to thousands of daily transactions compared with just dozens before the global release.</li>
<li><strong>Spare change investing app <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/acorns-moves-onto-robinhood-s-turf-with-direct-stock-investing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acorns is inching into Robinhood territory</a></strong> with its plan to build a feature that allows users to customize their own stock portfolios instead of just using Acorns&#8217; own ETFs.</li>
<li><strong>China&#8217;s WeChat will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/chinas-digital-currency-comes-to-tencents-wechat-in-expansion-push.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin supporting the digital yuan</a> (e-CNY),</strong> the country’s sovereign digital currency that&#8217;s been in the works since 2014. The move would bring the currency to WeChat Pay&#8217;s over 800 million MAUs.</li>
<li><strong>Apptopia revealed the <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/10-most-downloaded-finance-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top finance apps for 2021</a>, including to 10 most downloaded crypto apps</strong> &#8212; a list that was led by Binance, Crypto.com, and Coinbase.</li>

<h3>Social</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twitter released a handful of new features this week,</strong> including its own take on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/twitter-tweet-takes-video-replies/">TikTok&#8217;s video reactions </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/twitter-spaces-continues-testing-podcast-like-features/">updated Spaces features</a>, including the ability for hosts to see how many listeners joined live and how many replayed the Space after the fact.</li>

Hosts will be able to record and run their events directly on LinkedIn, host live conversations, moderate rooms and more.</li>
<li><strong>Snap is suing the USPTO for rejecting its application to trademark the word &#8220;spectacles&#8221;</strong> for its digital AR glasses. The application was rejected because spectacles is a generic term, and Snap&#8217;s version &#8220;has not acquired distinctiveness,&#8221; according to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870120/snap-suing-trademark-word-spectacles-smart-glasses-snapchat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report from The Verge</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Instagram was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/instagram-is-testing-private-likes-on-stories-with-select-users/">spotted testing</a> a new Stories feature that would allow users to &#8220;like&#8221; each other&#8217;s stories, but privately.</strong> Only the person who had posted the Story would be able to see the total number of likes and that there were not any plans to make the like count public.</li>
<li><strong>Tumblr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/">has been getting in trouble with Apple&#8217;s App Review</a> over the mature content in its app,</strong> leading it to new crackdowns that have confused Tumblr users. The company had been struggling to remove content featuring pornography, sex and other adult material from its iOS app, amid constant App Store rejections. It seems Tumblr&#8217;s own system requiring blogs to be labeled as &#8220;adult&#8221; wasn&#8217;t getting the job done to keep this sort of content out of the hands of iOS users. Complicating matters is how Apple&#8217;s review system works. Apple randomly assigns an app review to whoever is available at the time instead of allowing a company to work with an Apple employee on a more direct basis to solve a specific problem. That leads to inconsistent responses based on how each reviewer interprets Apple&#8217;s rules or their overall thoroughous. For Tumblr, it&#8217;s meant a lot of jumping through hoops to try to get its app cleaned up enough to be allowed back in the App Store.</li>

<h4>Dating</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tinder was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/tinder-is-developing-a-feature-called-swipe-party-that-invites-friends-to-join-your-swiping-sessions/">spotted developing a feature called Swipe Party</a> that lets users invite friends to their swiping session.</strong> Users send friends a link to establish a guest account, and then those friends can watch their friend using audio and video while they vet their dating prospects.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Messaging</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>China&#8217;s WeChat (to be fair, a super app not just a social messenger) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/tencent-s-wechat-app-keeps-growing-despite-beijing-crackdown?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said DAUs of its mini-programs grew</a> about 12.5% to 450 million in 2021</strong> and its native search function added 200 million MAUs over the past year. The growth took place among government crackdowns on local tech companies.</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp is preparing to introduce profile photo notifications</strong> in a future update, according to <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-introducing-profile-photos-in-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WABetaInfo</a>. The feature is being rolled out to beta users on iOS (iOS 15+).</li>

<p>Consumers worldwide downloaded <a href="https://www.oculus.com/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta’s Oculus app</a>, the mobile companion for Oculus VR devices including the Quest 2, roughly 2 million times globally since Christmas Day, according to new data from third-party app intelligence firms Apptopia and Sensor Tower. Already, there had been some indication that the Quest 2 was a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/27/metas-oculus-virtual-reality-headsets-were-a-popular-holiday-gift.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular holiday gift</a> after the Oculus app <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/12/27/win-meta-oculus-app-tops-app-store-rankings-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot to the top of the Apple App Store</a> for the first time ever on Christmas Day and became the most popular free app on Google Play in the U.S., as well.</p>
<p>During the week of Christmas in the U.S. (December 23-29), adoption of the Oculus app jumped up by 517% week-over-week to reach 1.5 million installs, <a href="https://sensortower.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensor Tower’s</a> data indicates.</p>
<p>In the week that followed, the firm saw those installs drop 77% to 345,000 from December 30 through January 5, but this figure is still higher than the week before Christmas 2021 by 42%. And it’s likely that these more recent downloads still include those who recently received a new Oculus device for the holidays, but hadn’t gotten around to setting it up yet.</p>
<p>While the U.S. accounted for the majority of the post-Christmas installs, app intelligence firms estimate that, in total, the app has seen around 2 million global installs from Christmas Day through the present across the App Store and Google Play combined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>In April 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/nextview-ventures-is-launching-a-remote-accelerator-for-startups/">NextView VC launched its debut accelerator</a> in the thick of the pandemic, while historical incubators like Y Combinator and 500 Startups were similarly rethinking their independent strategies. Key tweaks like making batches fully remote and scrapping the cohort model gave us a peek at how some of the most active pre-seed and seed investors were rethinking their jobs.</p>
<p>Fast-forward perhaps too many months, NextView partner Melody Koh tells me the accelerator <a href="https://nextview.vc/accelerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is launching its third cohort </a>with some key tweaks, again signaling some interesting changes for the seed-stage startup scene.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254685" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The first big change is that NextView is growing its check size from $200,000 for an 8% ownership stake to $400,000 for a 10% ownership stake. Big check sizes in this economy are anything but surprising, but Koh’s perspective is that the cash will “arm companies with just a little bit more ammunition that can really set them up.” Beyond market pressure, the firm realized they were the only funding sources for a lot of cohort startups — which meant they had to make larger initial investments to truly get these companies to follow on funding.</p>
<p>“It just provides a little bit more flexibility and the ability for teams to really experiment and execute and kind of get to the next stage of the milestones that this market now is looking for,” she added. So far, more than 50% of the NextView accelerator alumni identify as underrepresented founders and come from cities including Miami, Seattle, Boston, Birmingham, San Diego and New York.</p>
<p>Considering its distributed format, the firm has had to update its mentorship. This time around, it is pairing each of its six to eight batch startups with a primary partner for weekly meetings and a secondary for monthly meetings. The former will give the company a more on-going resource while they’re in the weeds and is a result of feedback NextView has seen from previous cohorts. The more involved partnership model could bring startup founders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/18/more-than-another-check-founders-need-activation-energy/">more activation energy</a> when they need it most.</p>
<p>And finally, the firm is doubling down on its no demo day rule. Part of the argument here is that the idea of an annual, flashy event may no longer be necessary for founders to land coveted attention.</p>
<p>“We don&#8217;t feel like the artificial kind of deadlines, and the demo day date format is the best use of your time,” Koh said. “The way we engage with every company is … ‘OK each of you has a different set of milestones that make sense for you,&#8217; so we don&#8217;t really focus on demo day as the right way to expend their energy or our energy.”</p>
<p>NextView isn’t alone in rethinking demo days and its broader investing strategy. Firms like Contrary Capital and startups like Launch House are similarly looking for smarter ways to land deals and propel startups.</p>
<p>Even in a world where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/capital-is-a-commodity/">capital is a commodity</a>, investors are preparing — perhaps even more so — to find innovative ways to make their cash even more worth it to founders. “Value add” chatter can be cringey at times, but to me it just signals that an emerging class of investors are figuring out what they’re best at (beyond spotting ambitious founders). That’s fun to see, and even something as small as a tweak on accelerator format can give us something to think about.</p>

As our own Mary Ann Azevedo reports, this Mexican fintech is opting for a non-traditional strategy when it comes to acquiring customers: going offline. The new, early-stage company is targeting 50 million underbanked individuals with face-to-face advertising: think street sales and debit card kiosks strategically placed in vaccination centers.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know</strong>: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/meet-bankaya-a-mexican-fintech-that-is-going-offline-for-customer-acquisition/">Just one year after launch</a>, Bankaya co-founders CEO Mauricio Cordero, Ramón Chedraui and Diego Vargas claim they landed 450,000 customers.

<p>Over the holidays, news broke that Black Girls Code co-founder and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/kimberly-bryant-suspended-black-girls-code/">CEO Kimberly Bryant was “suspended indefinitely” from the nonprofit organization</a> she launched nearly a decade ago. I spoke to the nonprofit board that decided to place her on leave, former employees who allege rising tensions between Bryant and the organization, and of course, Bryant herself to get the full story.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>There’s too much nuance in this story to sum it all up in a perfect blurb, so I’d really recommend those interested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/kimberly-bryant-suspended-black-girls-code/">to read the entire story.</a> As of now, the board claims it has formed a special committee to review complaints against Bryant from former and current employees and put Bryant on paid administrative leave last week “to ensure a full and fair review process.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even to outsiders, the inner workings of startup accelerators has become familiar: pumped up on camaraderie and energy drinks, scrappy founders do product demos onstage before a room full of buzzy journalists and investors.</p>
<p>Fast-forward two years into a pandemic and, even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/founders-hacker-hype-homes-remote-work/">a stint with the return of hacker homes,</a> much has changed about the way launch pads for startups look, feel and show value today. The earliest investors are rethinking signaling risk, dilution and, most surprisingly, the worth of a traditional demo day.</p>
<h2>Pro rata</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a juicy topic: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/how-pro-rata-works-in-venture-capital-deals/">pro rata</a>.</p>
<p>Signaling risk happens when a VC chooses to not do pro rata, or follow-on investing, in an existing portfolio company. The idea is that investors who know you best — the ones who bet on you earlier than others — are choosing not to invest in you in your next phase of growth, which must mean that the deal isn’t that great. Negative perception can trickle down to other investors who, despite what their Twitter bios will tell you, are pretty risk-averse folks.</p>
<p>Accelerators have an interesting role to play here. If an accelerator like Y Combinator ever gets to host 1,000 startups per batch, an automatic pro-rata investment in each startup would be both capital-intensive and perhaps unintentionally dilute its own signal. Like clockwork, in 2020, the accelerator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/changing-policy-y-combinator-cuts-its-pro-rata-stake-and-makes-investments-case-by-case/">changed its policy on automatic pro-rata investments</a> and chose to invest on a case-by-case basis, just like 500 Startups.</p>
<p>“We have significantly exceeded the funds we raised for pro ratas, and the investors who support YC do not have the appetite to fund the pro rata program at the same scale,” the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/changing-policy-y-combinator-cuts-its-pro-rata-stake-and-makes-investments-case-by-case/">accelerator wrote in a post then.</a> “In addition, processing hundreds of follow-on rounds per year has created significant operational complexities for YC that we did not anticipate.</p>
<p>“Said simply, investing in every round for every YC company requires more capital than we want to raise and manage. We always tell startups to stay small and manage their budgets carefully. In this instance, we failed to follow our own advice.”</p>

<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p>AirTags are a very useful product from Apple that pretty much function exactly as advertised.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s the problem.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a fair bit of controversy lately around how Apple rolled these out and how even though these are great devices to keep track of your keys, they can also easily be abused to stalk someone. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-brooks-nader-tracked-privacy-175938300.html">This isn&#8217;t a purely theoretical issue either, it&#8217;s already happening. </a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not a particularly unique scenario where technology can be used for good and bad purposes &#8212; just think about the decades-long conversation around encryption &#8212; that said I have a feeling that this is a scenario where Apple is going to lose and it&#8217;s going to be more embarrassing than any misstep in recent memory.</p>
<p>Apple has arranged so much of their wearable product marketing over the last few years on how their devices function in edge use cases. The Apple Watch&#8217;s last several generations have focused on health tracking features that could help identify rare conditions or help users in a life-threatening situation. TV commercials have documented the individual stories of users who have found the Apple Watch to be a life-saving tool. With AirTags, there&#8217;s potential for some of that same good, but there&#8217;s also much more downside. In the next year, we&#8217;re undoubtedly going to see examples of AirTags being used in nefarious ways that bundled together serve as the antithesis of one of these Apple Watch commercials. It may end up being a product defined by its gross shortcomings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166511" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166511" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2166511" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-3.jpg?w=600" alt="" width="600" height="180" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-3.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-3.jpg?resize=150,45 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-3.jpg?resize=300,90 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-3.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166511" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Built for Mars screengrab</p></div></p>
<p>Apple has made its own post-launch efforts to tighten up how AirTags that don&#8217;t belong to a certain user can be detected, but these notifications have proven buggy and have often waited far too long to alert users. Add in the fact that Apple has seemed to treat Android integration as an afterthought, not a necessary partnership in order to ship a device like this, and Apple&#8217;s incompetence looks a bit more severe.</p>
<p>I highly doubt that Apple is going to be able to design their way out of this problem. Regardless of what they ship on iOS to backtrack issues, Android&#8217;s fractured ecosystem means that safeguards won&#8217;t reach an awful lot of people who could be targeted.</p>
<p>For a nascent product category with such PR liability potential, it&#8217;s hard to see how Apple justifies continuing to sell AirTags. It&#8217;s a unique error from Apple in that the company delivered exactly what they initially promised but failed to consider the full scope of that initial promise&#8217;s direct consequences.</p>

<h2>other things</h2>
<p><em>Here are a few stories this week I think you should take a closer look at:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/elizabeth-holmes-verdict-guilty-theranos-fraud/"><b>Elizabeth Holmes convicted on 4 of 11 counts</b></a><br />
At long last, the trial of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes reached a resolution. Now, we wait for sentencing as well as further guidance on whether Holmes will be retried for several of the counts that the jury could not reach a verdict on. &#8220;Holmes was found guilty of conspiring to defraud investors, as well as defrauding investors from the DeVos family, hedge fund manager Brian Grossman and former estate and trust attorney Dan Mosely. She was not found guilty of charges related to defrauding patients,&#8221; my colleague Amanda reported.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/us-regulator-rules-that-google-infringed-on-sonos-speaker-patents/"><b>Google infringed on Sonos tech, trade court rules </b></a><br />
Google&#8217;s smart speakers infringed on key patents held by Sonos, a US regulator ruled this week, and the company will no longer be allowed to import the infringing products which are manufactured in China. Google has already begun rolling out design changes which it hopes will interrupt its ability to sell its smart speaker devices. Sonos has seen its early lead in the smart speaker war dissipate as tech giants have thrown their weight around, but the smaller hardware company isn&#8217;t shrinking away.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/lets-talk-ces-gadgets/">A smaller, quieter CES</a><br />
</b>The Omicron wave stopped the TechCrunch team from making our way to Las Vegas to check out the latest gadgets at the Consumer Electronics Show, but we were at the show in spirit and watching along with countless livestreams. While it was certainly a more low-key year, there were still plenty of wild gadgets this year. Here are some of the best ones we saw.</p>
<hr />

<h2>added things</h2>
<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch+</a> subscription service this week:</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/heres-how-startups-can-prevent-tech-debt-from-piling-up/">How startups can prevent tech debt from piling up</a></strong><br />
&#8220;&#8230;Favoring a short-term plan to get a faster go-to-market option is not always bad, provided the business has a backup plan to deliver well-designed code that would simplify future iterations and innovations. But for startups, reworking is difficult as deadlines and resource crunch prevent developers from producing clean and perfect code. Startups prioritize short-term plans and focus more on adding functionalities to achieve milestones, sign up marquee customers or raise funding. This roadmap shuffling and disregard for the long-term view trigger tech debt&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/5-growth-marketing-predictions-for-2022/"><b>5 growth marketing predictions for 2022</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s been a crazy year in growth marketing, what with the meteoric rise of TikTok, radical iOS privacy shifts and <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q3-2021-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=vc_market_update&amp;utm_medium=nl-na&amp;utm_source=daily_pitch&amp;utm_content=q3_2021_pitchbook-nvca_venture_monitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a staggering $240 billion poured into U.S. startups</a> as of September 30. All of this new money has meant heavier investments in growth marketing throughout 2021. The heavier investments have occurred during uncertain times, with startups scrambling to find ways to measure iOS conversions and unlock TikTok as a new channel&#8230;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/3-things-startup-founders-need-to-know-about-ma/"><b>3 things founders need to know about M&amp;A</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;M&amp;A is particularly beneficial for startups that struggle to scale operationally because they essentially buy cash flow, revenue and other companies’ traffic, meaning startups grab a bigger share of their markets. They’re also a good way for startups to find, consolidate and experiment with their value proposition. The problem though, is that most founders don’t know how to get started with M&amp;A and resign themselves to the shadows of bigger players. But mergers are accessible and advantageous to businesses of all sizes&#8230;&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Welcome back to the working world, friends, I hope that you survived the return to the desk in good stead and are both warm and healthy. The current boom in COVID cases is a huge bummer, but perhaps this is the last year we’ll have to drag ourselves back to productivity under the specter of lockdowns, mass death and a lack of hugs. I hope so.</p>
<p>Regardless, today we have a lot of fun stuff that should keep your mind off the state of the world for a few minutes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255207" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Kicking off today, let’s talk about Liquid Death. The excellently named company <em>kills</em> thirst with <em>water</em>, hence its name. That’s really the company in a nutshell. Liquid Death sells water in a can, a business around which it has tailored an anti-plastic stance and a general heavy metal vibe. It’s neat.</p>
<p>But Liquid Death <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/liquid-death-lands-75-million-more-in-funding-including-to-roll-out-flavored-water/">also raised $75 million this week</a>, which has me wondering why everything is so expensive to build these days. Why does a water company need to raise a whole pre-seed fund in a single investment? What does it need the money for? Research? It’s selling water!</p>
<p>There was a general perspective a few years ago that it was cheaper than ever to build a startup. With off-the-shelf software, cloud computing and modern fintech back ends, putting together the building blocks of modern business was becoming faster and less expensive. Apart from the high costs of hiring software developers, it seemed that startups would be able to do more with less.</p>
<p>And yet. Startups are raising more money than ever. The Exchange is diving into venture capital data next week, but it’s clear that the venture and startup classes are still moving funds around with great relish. So much so that Liquid Death has raised over $130 million to date, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/liquid-death-mountain-water" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<p>Square the circle of lower startup costs, and mega-rounds for me if you can. Are we seeing marketing spend raised through equity capital sources? If so, that makes me worry a bit!</p>
<p>(Note that Liquid Death could be a kickass business with great margins and lovely economics; I don’t know its numbers. But why does it need $75 million if it’s in such good shape? What are we missing here?)</p>
<h2>Level raised money</h2>
<p>From deep in the notes docs, a brief note on <a href="https://www.levelgoals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Level</a>. Level is a company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/level-closes-1-5m-to-provide-financial-services-to-gig-workers/">I covered back in February of 2021</a>. The company had just closed a $1.5 million round for work we described as bringing “credit to workers who might not be able to tap it from traditional sources, using their current income from freelance work to back the advance.”</p>
<p>It was a neat model, as lending based on assets over cash flow is a bit silly in a world where lots of folks work but don’t live asset-heavy lifestyles. (That’s a polite way of dissing NIMBY boomers, of course).</p>
<p>Anyway, Level raised another round as 2021 closed, this time a $7 million Series A. Anthos Capital led the funding, with NextView Ventures and other prior inventors also kicking in cash. The capital came after the company grew its size by “10x,” per its own data.</p>
<p>What I find most notable in the Level news item is not that the company raised more money — more that its goal set is super big. Per <a href="https://www.levelgoals.com/blog/level-raises-7m-seed-to-build-the-financial-operating-system-for-microbusinesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company</a>, it wants to build a “financial OS for microbusinesses.”</p>
<p>I dig that because tiny businesses are not the sorts of companies that get lots of attention from traditional financial institutions. Fintech should be, in my view, a method of applying tech to break down walls and bring more value to more folks. Level seems to be working along those lines, while also building a venture-ready business. Neat!</p>
<h2>PsyMed raises a biotech fund</h2>
<p>On the heels of news that a16z has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/andreessen-horowitz-raises-9b-in-new-capital-for-venture-growth-bio-funds/">put together $9 billion in new funds</a> for venture, growth and biotech investing it’s easy to forget that there are smaller funds in the market as well. And some that are quite new, in fact.</p>
<p>On the biotech front <a href="https://psymed.ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PsyMed Ventures</a> is busy raising a $25 million fund, the first close of which ($8 million) is in the bank. I chatted with the group Friday to dig in a bit more to their model.</p>
<p>First, basics. PsyMed has three investing partners: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dina-burkitbayeva-93950b65/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dina Burkitbayeva</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kubeans?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Kubin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/matisere?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matias Serebrinsky</a>. As you can work out from its first fund size target, it will be investing on the earlier side of things in the psychedelic medical space, along with a few related areas. The group isn’t new to working together, having previously formed an investing group using AngelList tech to invest around $15 million to date.</p>
<p>A few thoughts about PsyMed. First, I am hype that we’re expanding the boundaries of what we’re testing for medical use. Prudishness in my home country has held back this sort of work, to our detriment. Second, the biotech investing space is interesting to me as the companies founded go public a lot earlier than what we tend to see in, say, the enterprise software market. So, you get to see more about companies, more quickly and more frequently.</p>
<p>For venture investors in biotech companies, this can also mean earlier liquidity possibilities than what is often seen in today’s unicorn era.</p>
<p>Talking with Burkitbayeva, Kubin and Serebrinsky gave me the impression that we’re nearing a confluence point in terms of regulatory, scientific and medical progress that could unlock a lot of neat new treatments for some sticky human matters. Things like PTSD, treatment-resistant depression and my personal favorite, substance-use disorder.</p>
<p>All this is to say that I’ll be keeping out an eye for where the group puts its new fund to work and how quickly they can boost early-stage pharma startups into the public markets. Here’s to reading more biotech S-1s this year and next, I suppose!</p>
<h2>The weekend</h2>
<p>And that’s what I have for now — don’t forget that <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a> is back to its regular thrice-weekly cadence next week, so I’ll chat with you on your podcasting app of choice in short order! Hugs!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elizabeth Holmes&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/elizabeth-holmes-verdict-guilty-theranos-fraud/">fraud trial</a> has been the talk of the town (both in Silicon Valley and, you know, on Twitter). The four-month trial was so popular that the journalists who covered it had to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/28/reader-center/holmes-trial-coverage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wake up at 3 A.M.</a> to make sure they could get a seat in the courtroom and do their jobs. Too many curious onlookers and fans of John Carreyrou&#8217;s tell-all &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/16/in-bad-blood-a-pedestrian-tale-of-heuristics-and-lies/">Bad Blood</a>&#8221; wanted to witness tech history for themselves.</p>
<p>One of those curious onlookers was <a href="https://daniellebaskin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Danielle Baskin</a>, a San Francisco-based artist who often pokes fun at tech culture through elaborate pranks (like <a href="https://bluecheckhomes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Check Homes</a>) that sometimes turn into actual companies (like <a href="https://brandedfruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded Fruit</a>). She arrived at the courthouse in San Jose with a suitcase in tow, selling bootleg Holmes merch: blonde wigs, red lipstick, black turtlenecks and blood energy drinks.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the long cold morning outside the San Jose courthouse, I vended Elizabeth Holmes costumes out of a suitcase for anyone in the trial line. <a href="https://t.co/ITaneixBu0">pic.twitter.com/ITaneixBu0</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253876" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Danielle Baskin (@djbaskin) <a href="https://twitter.com/djbaskin/status/1463213116943060997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It was a joke, mocking the absurdity of the fact that someone on trial for fraud has &#8220;stans&#8221; who call themselves &#8220;<a href="https://www.insider.com/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-court-fans-holmies-girl-boss-fraud-2021-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holmies</a>.&#8221; But as Baskin watched Holmes&#8217; third day of testimony, she shared a key insight about how Theranos got so out of control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming out of the Holmes trial, I think one of my biggest pieces of advice to startup founders is to have friends,&#8221; Baskin <a href="https://twitter.com/djbaskin/status/1463653213911932929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> after court adjourned. &#8220;You need people in your life you enjoy hanging out with that say things like &#8216;lol what are you talking about&#8217; or &#8216;that&#8217;s a bad idea&#8217; when you say weird shit.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Smoke and mirrors</h2>
<p>In his opening statement of the case, federal prosecutor Robert Leach described how Holmes constructed a company with a $10 billion valuation based on technology that was dangerously faulty, at best. He said that one of Holmes&#8217; techniques was to rely on &#8220;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/08/elizabeth-holmes-was-well-aware-of-theranos-problems-but-went-to-great-lengths-to-deceive-investors-prosecution-says/?sh=6509b3aa294d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">false and misleading</a>&#8221; media coverage of Theranos to secure funding from investors. Holmes was on the cover of Fortune, Forbes and Inc. Magazine, and she was celebrated as one of TIME&#8217;s 100 Most Influential People in 2015, lauded as a &#8220;tech visionary.&#8221; It made sense that people believed her vision when so many powerful people and institutions said she was the next Steve Jobs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When I was introduced to Elizabeth by [former Secretary of State] George Shultz, her plan sounded like an undergraduate’s dream. I told her she had only two prospects: total failure or vast success. There would be no middle ground,&#8221; Henry Kissinger <a href="https://time.com/collection-post/3822734/elizabeth-holmes-2015-time-100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in the TIME 100 blurb about Holmes. &#8220;Elizabeth accepted only one option: making a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kissinger went on to call Holmes a &#8220;formidable advocate&#8221; who was &#8220;on the verge of achieving her vision.&#8221; But already, a level of uncertainty bubbled around Theranos. &#8220;Others will judge the technical aspects of Theranos, but the social implications are vast,&#8221; Kissinger wrote in the final line of the blurb.</p>
<p>Holmes was surrounded by hype &#8212; investors like George Shultz treated her like another grandchild. So when his grandson Tyler Shultz, who worked at Theranos, told him that he suspected Holmes was lying about the efficacy of Theranos&#8217; technology, the senior Shultz didn&#8217;t believe him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth is a very, very charismatic person,&#8221; Tyler Shultz said to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/tyler-shultz-reacts-to-elizabeth-holmes-verdict/#x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News</a> this week. &#8220;When she speaks to you, she makes you feel like you are the most important person in her world in that moment. She almost has this reality distortion field around her that people can just get sucked into.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Isolation and abuse</h2>
<p>Tyler Shultz became the first whistleblower for Theranos, but at great personal and financial cost &#8212; in his audio-memoir &#8220;Thicker than Water,&#8221; he discussed being threatened by high-profile lawyers like David Boies and being followed by <a href="https://twitter.com/johncarreyrou/status/1435410977915170818?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private investigators</a>. But Shultz told a brief, yet poignant anecdote in his memoir about attending family dinners with his grandfather, who always invited Holmes and even hosted her thirtieth birthday party.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a weird situation where my parents kept telling [Holmes] to invite her parents, and they just kind of assumed that she did, and then my grandparents were talking to Elizabeth&#8217;s parents on the phone, and Elizabeth&#8217;s parents were completely unaware she was having a thirtieth birthday party, so it didn&#8217;t seem she was very close with her parents at all,&#8221; Shultz recalled. Throughout the trial, Holmes was usually seen clutching her mom&#8217;s hand &#8212; but per Shultz&#8217;s memory, they weren&#8217;t all that close at the time of her crimes.</p>
<p>Shultz goes on to describe the attendees of her birthday party: He says that he and Holmes&#8217; brother were the only people under 30, and the next youngest person was Theranos COO Sunny Balwani, who was almost 50 &#8212; he met Holmes when she was 18 and he was 37. They dated in secret for more than 10 years, unbeknownst to most Theranos employees and investors. Holmes moved in with Balwani in 2005, soon after she dropped out of Stanford.</p>
<p>&#8220;He impacted everything about who I was and I don’t fully understand that,&#8221; Holmes testified.</p>
<p>Holmes tearfully explained in court that Balwani sexually and emotionally abused her throughout their relationship. She said that he controlled what she ate, when she slept and how she behaved.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me that I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing in business, that my convictions were wrong, that he was astonished by my mediocrity, and that if I followed my instincts I was going to fail,&#8221; Holmes said on the stand.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Elizabeth Holmes&#39;s daily schedule</p>
<p>Circa 2005–2009 <a href="https://t.co/hhWUBHhpbe">pic.twitter.com/hhWUBHhpbe</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Internal Tech Emails (@TechEmails) <a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1465802215927558154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Her defense submitted as evidence two documents that showed how Holmes was being controlled by Balwani: one was a schedule of her <a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%207731/Trial%20Exh.%207731%20Notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daily routine</a>, while another set <a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%207734/Trial%20Exh.%207734%20Notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions</a> for how she behaved. These guidelines would help her &#8220;become a new Elizabeth,&#8221; Holmes said Balwani told her. One &#8220;non-negotiable&#8221; in her instructions declared that she would never meet with anyone &#8212; especially direct reports &#8212; for longer than five minutes unless she had written down a clear agenda for the meeting. According to the documents, her lifestyle was monastic: waking up at 4 A.M., praying, mediating, exercising, only eating certain foods and never doing anything for recreation.</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217; schedule became a bit of a meme, with some journalists even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2021/elizabeth-holmes-schedule-tried-myself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying out her schedule</a> for clicks &#8212; but the reality is much darker than that. It may be difficult to take Holmes&#8217; account of abuse seriously, since she&#8217;s famously a liar and was just convicted of criminal fraud &#8212; but these documents, if legitimate, show a woman whose every action was being controlled by an older partner and business associate.</p>
<p>“He said I needed to spend all of my time on the business, and that I should only be spending time with people who could help the business to be successful, that I needed to be working seven days a week, and I needed to be only doing things that could contribute to making the company successful,&#8221; Holmes testified.</p>
<p>In this context, Shultz&#8217;s account of Holmes thirtieth birthday party makes more sense. She was so committed to building Theranos that she didn&#8217;t seem to have any friends or hobbies, nor did she communicate enough with her parents to invite them to her birthday party.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sunny would get very upset if I was with my family, because he said it was a distraction to the business,&#8221; Holmes said in trial. Her defense referenced a <a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205387F/Trial%20Exh.%205387F%20Text%20Messages.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text</a> from Balwani from Thanksgiving weekend in 2013, which said: &#8220;When ur family is here, I feel lonely bcz u spend a total of 10 seconds with me a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe if Holmes had friends to confide in, someone would have told her that she was going too far by stretching the truth with investors, or that it wasn&#8217;t a good idea to deliver unreliable blood test results to patients, even if her boyfriend-slash-COO said to do so. But by design, there was no one for the single-minded entrepreneur to talk to.</p>
<h2>Founders need community</h2>
<p>This is not to exonerate Holmes of her crimes. It can be true that she was abused by a controlling, manipulative, older partner, yet it can simultaneously be true that she committed fraud. Plus, even though she was not convicted of defrauding patients, her lies caused significant distress to Theranos customers who were given alarmingly false blood test results.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about what the tech industry learned from Theranos, but we gloss over something so simple: Startup founders need to have a life outside of their job.</p>
<p>We valorize founders like Elizabeth Holmes who are so dedicated to their vision that they will make huge sacrifices, abandoning their social lives to build their companies. But this isolating form of hustle culture doesn&#8217;t usually breed success &#8212; it breeds burnout at best, and millions of dollars of criminal fraud at worst.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a startup founder, you&#8217;re probably not the next Elizabeth Holmes. But if you just do normal things like, I don&#8217;t know, see a gosh darn movie with some friends (COVID permitting), maybe you&#8217;ll spare yourself from making some short-sighted mistakes.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Mergers and acquisitions are notoriously tricky to navigate from a leadership and culture perspective. They require a thoughtful approach to working with a new CEO and joining teams as one workforce — a journey familiar to us and recently acquired Auth0.</p>
<p>Okta and Auth0 have their share of differences — we’re enterprise-focused, to start, while Auth0 is more developer-first — but shaping the future of identity has always been a shared goal. Since the acquisition closed earlier this year, the CEO of Auth0, Eugenio Pace, and I have come a long way in uncovering the best ways to embrace our differences, unite our teams and learn the ins and outs of each other’s leadership styles.</p>
<p>Our journey so far offers lessons for other CEOs navigating partnerships with a new co-CEO or other C-suite leaders post-acquisition. Here are my top takeaways from working together during the past year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254698" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Do the prep work upfront</h2>
<p>It’s worthwhile to put pen to paper on your company’s vision ahead of an acquisition — it helps you solidify your goals in writing that you can then easily share. Before our acquisition, I wrote a long paper mapping out my five-year vision for Okta. While articulating Okta’s vision is a big part of my role as CEO, I had never laid it out in this type of written format (which turned out longer than I intended — 15 pages!).</p>
<p>The exercise allowed me to reflect on Okta’s growth over the past 12-plus years and what’s to come.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Our employees probably think we sound like broken records on these integration priorities, but aligning on values has helped promote clarity and consistency across our teams during a time of change.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Eugenio found it helpful in understanding my viewpoint as we started the process of learning how we’d best collaborate and bring our two companies together. He’d actually drafted a similar document outlining his view of success if we were to join forces. These vision documents have helped us align our goals and illustrate how we intend to scale and capitalize on our massive market opportunity.</p>
<h2>Identify common ground in how you lead</h2>
<p>With any new C-suite hire or partner, it helps to build a relationship by finding common ground and shared values. Eugenio and I knew we both placed equal importance on implementing the same “north star” guidelines for the integration: sustainable growth, putting our customers first, continued innovation, protection of our brands and empowerment of our teams.</p>
<p>Our employees probably think we sound like broken records on these integration priorities, but aligning on values has helped promote clarity and consistency across our teams during a time of change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Along with our mirrored core culture values, Eugenio and I share similarities in our leadership styles and personalities that complement each other. We’re introverts, and we even have the same Myers-Briggs score (INTP), translating into a natural leadership chemistry. We both take accountable, dependable leadership seriously and understand each other’s work styles. Eugenio has a deep product and technology background, so we’re able to get really technical when discussing and making decisions about the future of our joint companies. Our shared background also enables us to effectively share and receive feedback with each other.</p>
<p>Ultimately, understanding your new partner’s unique style and how you’re similar (and different) can help you work together more efficiently, make faster decisions and build quick momentum.</p>
<h2>Tap the strengths of both teams</h2>
<p>Acquisitions signal that a significant threshold of success has been crossed for companies on either side of the deal. To acquire or be acquired, companies must be doing <em>something</em> right and it’s essential to identify the strengths within both organizations that have reaped such rewards. Combining the elements of each team that fosters an overall synergy while also protecting the unique areas is key when joining forces.</p>
<p>For example, Auth0’s collaborative culture has already helped Okta reignite its startup spirit. It’s no easy task maintaining the same scrappy energy from the early days when we were pursuing our first 10 customers (we’re now over 14,000), but Auth0 has introduced a new perspective on innovation while still allowing room to retain our respective brands and individual strengths. Auth0 is a brand beloved by developers, and its remote-first nature has also helped us navigate a dynamic work environment this year. Leveraging the strengths of the acquired company helps push your growth forward in new areas.</p>
<h2>When in doubt, over-communicate</h2>
<p>In the early stages of an acquisition, success depends on intentional and frequent communication with your new partner and team. Keep meetings and check-ins frequent, both with new leaders and with your broader employee base.</p>
<p>This year, we’ve regularly held full company and integrated all-hands meetings, and we’ve made these meetings intentional and transparent. We format the agendas around decisions we’ve made, things that won’t change and what’s undecided as a way to keep employees in the know while staying honest about what we’re still figuring out. In any acquisition, discussions on office spaces, merged benefits and team integration timelines will inevitably arise, and giving employees an open line to ask questions and share concerns goes a long way in creating clarity and building trust.</p>
<p>Acquisitions can test your team’s strength and threaten existing close-knit cultures, so it takes purposeful communication to keep everyone on the same page and working toward the same goal.</p>
<p>It’s worth the energy spent to make the partnership successful; Eugenio and I have worked together for less than a year, and we’ve already benefited greatly from each other’s perspectives and background as we move forward in this next chapter.</p>

<strong>Testimonial: </strong>&#8220;Ridhi and team 91Ninjas bring in good domain knowledge, high-quality thinking, and focused execution. We chose them for their expertise, disciplined approach, and excellent work ethics. Thanks to team 91NInjas, our inbound marketing engine has picked up good momentum. After coming onboard, they rapidly kick-started work on multiple fronts. In particular, we witnessed good traction on the social media and content front. We saw a good surge in organic traffic on blogs and our search appearance on domain-specific keywords has improved a lot.&#8221;</p>

<strong>Testimonial: </strong>&#8220;I came across some social posts done by 91Ninjas for other startups and was impressed by their work. They had a very different approach to social and it appealed to me. They are a team of good thinkers and know how to tell brand stories and engage users. They hear you out, understand the business goal and then work backward to craft a custom strategy that can help you achieve your goals. Their logical approach, seamless execution, and getting work done attitude makes them stand out from others. For startups, they are a good choice given the way they work (just like your internal team) and the value they bring in.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 7, 2021! It’s Friday and the snow is falling like the dickens in my neck of the woods. But it was no snow day in the tech world. Not at <em>all</em>. In fact, one venture firm raised 10 figures of capital today. Can you guess who?</p>
<p>Before we jump in, today’s TechCrunch staff highlight is <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grace Mendenhall</a>, a member of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Equity team</a> who is also a documentary film editor. And she’s frankly just the best. Now, the news! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255222" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/andreessen-horowitz-raises-9b-in-new-capital-for-venture-growth-bio-funds/"><strong>a16z reloads with $9B in new capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The venture capital money arms race continued this week with news that Andreessen Horowitz has put together $9 billion to invest in venture deals, growth deals and biotech more specifically. As TechCrunch notes, the resulting dollar figure is a boost on the group’s last trio of similar funds. There is, it appears, an infinite capital appetite in today’s startup market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/roblox-transition-china-luobulesi-tencent/"><strong>Roblox pulls Chinese app:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Five months after launching with Tencent in China, Roblox’s LuoBuLeSi was taken down. What happened? It may be that Roblox has some work to do on the data side of its service, something that it hinted at in a statement. Regardless, the move is yet another example of how hard it is for non-Chinese companies to build and sell digital products in the country.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/india-hits-google-with-antitrust-investigation-over-alleged-abuse-in-news-aggregation/"><strong>India to investigate Google:</strong></a> In the wake of industry complaints from news groups, India’s Competition Commission “said Friday that Google dominates certain online services and its initial view is that Google has broken the local antitrust laws,” TechCrunch reports. Given how big and lucrative the Indian market is, this is not good news for Mountain View.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we jump into all the startup news of the day, TechCrunch has a little treat for you. We got veteran venture capitalist Matt Murphy on the phone as 2021 came to a close <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/how-todays-startup-market-isnt-like-1999-and-what-you-need-to-raise-a-hot-series-a/">to chat about prior tech booms, prior tech busts and what he sees as the strengths and weaknesses</a> of today’s venture game. It’s a great weekend read.</p>
<p>And now, the news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/pendulum-raises-5-9m-to-help-organizations-track-harmful-narratives/"><strong>Pendulum raises $5.9M for narrative tracking:</strong></a> This is a fun one, as the company’s target market is utterly new to me. Per our reporting, Pendulum “helps companies, governments and other organizations track harmful narratives on social media platforms and elsewhere on the web.” I guess you and I currently do this by reading lots of tweets, but seeing a company build software for it makes good sense.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/peter-reinhardt-leaves-twilio-to-run-his-carbon-mitigation-startup/"><strong>Peter Reinhardt leaves Twilio:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Remember when Twilio bought Segment for $3.2 billion? It also bought Segment’s CEO, Peter Reinhardt, as part of the deal. Now, however, the exec is leaving to “be full-time CEO at Charm Industrial, a carbon mitigation startup he co-founded in 2018,” Ron Miller reports. I can’t quite connect <em>charm</em> and <em>carbon</em>, but we’ll keep an eye out for what the startup does next.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/avataar-raises-45-million-to-improve-consumer-shopping-experience-with-life-sized-3d-product-evaluation/"><strong>Avataar raises $45M for “life-sized 3D product evaluation&#8221;:</strong></a> No, this is not &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; like the movie. It’s Avataar, a U.S.- and India-based startup that helps consumers “visualize products in real-life size and feel in their living room” using their phones. Given that we all want to buy more stuff online, but it’s not always easy to picture a new footstool in situ, I like what the company is up to. Unsurprisingly, Avataar is working with e-commerce brands in categories like furniture.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/nigerian-ethical-credit-recovery-fintech-bfree-secures-1-7m-expands-to-asia-europe-south-america-and-across-africa/"><strong>Bfree wants to update the irksome business of credit collections:</strong></a> If you have ever gotten a call from a person who thinks that you owe them or someone that they represent money, you may have harkened back to how much more fun it was to get a root canal. Bfree, a “Nigerian credit management fintech,” as TechCrunch puts it, is working to build something that it considers to be more ethical debt collection. The company just raised $1.7 million and is busy recruiting in 16 markets, we report.</li>
<li><strong>From the CES Beat: </strong>TechCrunch’s coverage of the great consumer electronics confab continued today, with posts up on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/startups-at-ces-showed-that-age-tech-can-help-everyone/">the promises of elder tech</a> and, well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/at-ces-2022-metaverses-metaversed-the-metaverse/">all things metaverse, good and bad</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need <em>even more </em>startup news and notes and analysis this weekend, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/can-you-build-centralized-islands-in-a-decentralized-ocean/">the Equity team has you covered</a>.</p>

<p>This is a fantastic time to launch a startup, but if you&#8217;re trying to grow one — well, winter is coming.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already noted the impacts of new data regulations and consumers&#8217; growing desire for more privacy, but here&#8217;s another log to toss on the bad news fire: As a percentage of company revenue, marketing budgets plummeted from 11% in 2020 to 6.4% last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the lowest proportion allocated to marketing in the history of Gartner’s Annual CMO Spend Survey,&#8221; the research company reported.</p>
<p>Rebecca Lynn, co-founder and general partner at Canvas Ventures, has had dozens of conversations with early-stage founders in recent months.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/after-talking-to-marketing-leaders-for-a-year-heres-my-advice-for-ceos/">In a TechCrunch+ guest post,</a> she covers the &#8220;downward pressure on the efficiency of marketing dollars&#8221; and shares several strategies that are producing results — as well as some &#8220;crazy&#8221; ideas &#8220;that seemed ridiculous at the time.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/apple-fitness-introduces-new-collections-feature-and-time-to-run-series/">Apple keeps working on its fitness product:</a> </strong>TechCrunch has news up today regarding Apple’s fitness product, the somewhat lamely named Fitness+. What’s new? Collections, which we write are ”curated series of workouts and meditations” that are targeted at a particular goal. Also new is what’s called “Time to Run,” an “audio running experience,” as we put it. Why doesn’t Apple just buy Peloton? I don’t know.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/twitter-spaces-continues-testing-podcast-like-features/"><strong>When does a Twitter Space become a podcast?</strong></a><strong> </strong>We’re going to find out. Twitter is working on recording its live-audio product, called Spaces. And the social network is saying that it will include replay analytics. Which is super cool? Twitter’s product team is seemingly bringing its really solid 2021 product cadence into the new year.</li>
<li>And finally, from CES, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/smarter-powerful-electric-scooters-bikes-ces-2022/"><strong>roundup of electric mobility two-wheelers</strong></a> for everyone out there who lives in a city that hasn’t given up its soul to provide more parking for lazy folks.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Long gone are the days when CES actually stood for “Consumer Electronics Show” &#8212; the CTA has seen to that in its various small print. I recommend you check out our recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/the-best-tech-of-ces-2012/">best of CES 2012</a> story for a look back on the days when things like smartphones took center stage at the event. Mobile World Congress has taken some of the wind out of CES’s sails, along with an increased push for companies to debut flagships at their own events.</p>
<p>This year we got, what, Samsung budget-flagship and a preview of the latest OnePlus device from a parallel event? Certainly things weren’t helped along by the fact that LG and HTC &#8212; which were both involved in the show in some form &#8212; are either mostly or entirely out of the smartphone game. And Huawei, which had a major presence at the show a few years back, won’t be participating in CES any time soon.</p>
<p>Much of that vacuum has been filled by transportation. Over the past decade, CES has transformed into a major automotive show, as carmakers look to prove to the world that they’re on the bleeding edge of tech, from autonomy to in-car systems to sending robots to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/at-ces-2022-metaverses-metaversed-the-metaverse/">Martian metaverse</a>. Certainly the show kept <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ces-2022-best-weirdest-car-tech/">Kirsten and Rebecca very busy this week</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255297" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces/">CES</a> continues to be a major event on the consumer hardware side of things, as well, even if there aren’t as many phones as there once were. It’s still a major showcase for PCs, connected health, smart home gadgets, accessories and even robotics. It’s also a fascinating look into how the industry is evolving. Take fitness &#8212; the sheer volume of wearables has reduced, though companies are experimenting with newer form factors like rings. Meanwhile, there’s been a surge in companies looking to take on the likes of Peloton and Mirror.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2255312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20210614_Support_FIT_0087_RGB-small.webp?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Garmin</p></div></p>
<p>At what was a pretty subdued showing for wearables, Garmin managed to grab some headlines with its hybrid Sport smartwatch. Hybrid smartwatches have been an admittedly mixed bag over the years, but Garmin has proven to be a surprisingly strong brand in the wearables category. And the <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/ces/stylish-vivomove-sport-hybrid-smartwatch-by-garmin-is-a-timeless-blend-of-fashion-and-function/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivomove Sport</a> is a pretty great looking watch, with a clean design that will appeal to those put off by flashier smartwatches.</p>
<p>Trackers had a bit of moment, in the wake of the popularity of products like Tile and Apple AirTags.

<p>But Chipolo gets the nod here with the introduction of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/chipolo-takes-on-tile-with-a-new-lost-wallet-tracker-that-works-with-apples-find-my/">CARD</a>. The device, which also supports Find My, is slightly larger than a credit card and designed to live in a wallet, so you get an alert whenever you leave the product behind. I currently own one AirTag, which I use for my keys. As someone who has misplaced his wallet more than once in my adult life, I’d say this is a fairly compelling use case that would make me consider shelling out for another.</p>

<p>Devin dropped the AXE11000 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router at the end of his whole <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/look-upon-my-ces-2022-work-from-home-setup-and-despair/">what my work from home set up would look like if I was independently wealthy roundup</a> (paraphrasing here). This thing is pretty wild &#8212; especially as far as the world of routers go. The system features motorized antenna that adjust to get a stronger signal. No word on price there, but you’re likely going to pay for that luxury on top of TP-Link’s already high base price. But can you really put a price tag on faster Wi-Fi?</p>

<p>Shout-out to what’s likely to be a far more reasonably price remote accessory. If nothing else, Anker knows how to keep costs down; $220 will get you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/anker-debuts-a-2k-webcam-with-built-in-lighting-speakers-and-more-for-220/">the Video Bar,</a> which is a kind of all-in-one webcam solution. You get a 2K camera with AI-based picture framing, coupled with a built-in lightbar and speakers. It’s not going to replace more advanced studio setups (or, for that matter, the Opal), but it’s a solid plug and play solution for those looking to up their home video game on the (relatively) cheap.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, I wrote a lot of words about CES’s evolution as a robotics show. One of the biggest sticking points there is the general lack of viable home robotics, beyond the Roomba and an army of fellow robotic vacuums. I was happy to get a better look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/labrador-set-to-deliver-a-robotic-helping-hand-to-homes-in-2023/">Labrador’s system this week</a>, however, because it addresses a very real need &#8212; specifically those with limited mobility looking to remain independent. The system is effectively a mobile helping hand for the home.</p>

<p>It’s not CES without fun new form factors, and the <a href="https://press.asus.com/PressReleases/p/ASUS-Presents-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED</a> takes the cake by a mile this year, adopting the foldable phone form factor into a full laptop. What’s most stunning about the thing is that the company actually plans to release the thing. I suspect I’m not alone in assuming this thing was just a concept the first time I saw a render, but Asus is planning to release the system in Q2 of this year. So we’ll see soon enough how close the commercial product looks to these shots.</p>

<p>Samsung skipped its usual sensory bombardment this year. There weren’t any robots, just bespoke washing machines and budget phones, but it did manage to sneak in a fun projector, of all things. Despite their relatively limited appeal, companies keep trying to make projectors happen, and at the very least, <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-launches-the-freestyle-a-portable-screen-for-entertainment-wherever-you-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> is small, well-built and looks good. It’s also $900, which means it&#8217;s likely destined to stay in its niche.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It has somehow, inexplicably, impossibly been almost 10 years since the original Oculus Rift hit Kickstarter.</p>
<p>A decade of development later, VR headsets have gotten better and better — but it&#8217;s safe to say, at this point, that VR&#8217;s adoption will be … gradual. If we&#8217;re all destined to end up with headsets (be they VR, AR or some mix of the two) strapped to our faces, it&#8217;ll be less about one-big-thing* and more the result of a thousand tiny steps. A Beat Saber here; a Supernatural there. Incrementally better/lighter/faster headsets. Maybe folks get used to using headsets for training purposes at work. Maybe everyone suddenly agrees on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/at-ces-2022-metaverses-metaversed-the-metaverse/">what a metaverse is</a>.</p>
<p>This bit-by-bit advancement held true this year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces/">CES</a>. There was plenty of VR/AR news, none of it earth shattering — but each another step in the progression.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255273" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><em>(* the one potential meteor strike, of course, being if Apple does what it loves to do and swoops in late, drops its version and turns the category on its head. That&#8217;s been the rumor<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/apple-said-to-be-working-a-high-priced-standalone-vr-headset-as-debut-mixed-reality-product/"> for a while now.</a>)</em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s recap the biggest VR/AR bits from the show.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve known for a while now that Sony has been working on a next-gen headset for the PlayStation 5, following up on the PS VR headset it released in 2016. But beyond a kind of light &#8220;We&#8217;re working on it!&#8221; announcement back in early 2021 and some details about the controllers a few months later, they hadn&#8217;t shared many specifics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They&#8217;re still keeping some cards close, but they shared a few more details on what&#8217;s now officially known <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/sony-psvr2-ps5-first-details-ces/">as the PS VR2</a>. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;ll have a resolution of 2000&#215;2040 per eye.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll have a wider field of view than the first-gen headset, at 110 degrees versus 96.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll have a refresh rate of 90/120 Hz.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll be able to track the motion of your eyes, potentially allowing you to do stuff like highlight interface elements just by looking at them.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll support foveated rendering, which is a fancy way of saying it can use processing power more efficiently by prioritizing the rendering of whatever&#8217;s in the center of your vision.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re building new controllers for it (pictured below) with finger detection and the PS5&#8217;s mind-bending adaptive triggers.</li>
</ul>

<p>What&#8217;ll the headset look like? Unknown! When will it actually ship? TBD! But with the PS VR being one of the few headsets to even kind of rival the <s>Oculus</s> Meta Quest in terms of ease of use, it&#8217;s nice to see Sony continuing to build here.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2255294" style="width: 681px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255294" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255294 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg" alt="" width="671" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg 671w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255294" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HTC Vive</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best way to handle input in VR? Most of the popular headsets have settled on some sort of controller in each hand. What if you just make your <em>hand</em> the controller, instead?</p>
<p>Hand tracking isn&#8217;t a brand new idea, of course. Companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/once-poised-to-kill-the-mouse-and-keyboard-leap-motion-plays-its-final-hand/">have come and gone</a> with hand tracking as their primary focus.</p>
<p>But HTC&#8217;s approach here is a bit different. Instead of relying entirely on cameras, they&#8217;re hoping you&#8217;ll strap sensor-packed bands to each wrist to help the system track what the cameras can&#8217;t see — like when one hand is obscuring the other, or you&#8217;ve got your arm back behind you for a golf swing. The company also demonstrated the sensors working while attached to other objects, like ping pong paddles and a NERF gun.</p>
<p>The company says the sensors should start shipping later this year for $129. One catch? For now, at least, it&#8217;ll only work with HTC&#8217;s Vive Focus 3 headset.</p>
<h2>Shiftall MeganeX</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255293" style="width: 1052px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255293" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255293 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg" alt="" width="1042" height="633" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg 1042w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=768,467 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=680,413 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1042px) 100vw, 1042px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255293" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shiftall</p></div></p>
<p>VR headsets have gotten a whole lot sleeker over the years, but they&#8217;re still pretty beefy. How much smaller can they really get, though?</p>
<p>Panasonic subsidiary Shiftall has been working on an &#8220;ultra-lightweight, ultra-high-resolution&#8221; headset called the Meganex. With speakers built into the frames and a 1.3&#8243; (2560&#215;2560) display for each eye, they end up looking more like a massive pair of steampunk sunglasses than a headset. While designed to be lightweight and foldable, don&#8217;t expect to move around <em>too</em> much in these ones — you&#8217;ll need to attach them to computer via USB-C to do the heavy graphical lifting.</p>
<p>Shiftall says these should ship this year for &#8220;less than $900.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Microsoft partners with Qualcomm for AR chips</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255291" style="width: 1219px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255291" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255291 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg" alt="" width="1209" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg 1209w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=300,124 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=768,318 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=680,281 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1209px) 100vw, 1209px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255291" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft already uses Qualcomm chips for their HoloLens headsets, but the companies made things a bit more official this week. At Qualcomm&#8217;s keynote it was announced that the two will work together to develop chips built specifically for use in AR headsets, with said chips supporting each of their augmented reality development platforms (Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces.)</p>
<h2>Nvidia Omniverse</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2253077" style="width: 1839px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253077" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2253077 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg" alt="" width="1829" height="1030" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg 1829w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1829px) 100vw, 1829px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253077" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvida</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not flashy hardware, but it&#8217;s potentially important on the software side of things: Nvidia this week opened up Omniverse, its collection of tools for helping 3D content creators work together in real time.</p>
<p>Writes Frederic Lardinois in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/nvidia-expands-its-omniverse/">his post on the news</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omniverse</a> is Nvidia’s platform for allowing creators, designers and engineers to collaboratively build virtual worlds. It’s the company’s platform that brings together design tools and assets from first- and third-party applications into a single hardware and software ecosystem. Until now, Omniverse and the various Nvidia tools that support it were in beta, but at CES today, the company took off the beta label and made Omniverse generally available to creators.</p></blockquote>
<h2>TCL&#8217;s AR Glasses</h2>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5m-1PfFA9c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>This one seems mostly like a concept for now, so … well, don&#8217;t fall in love just yet. But TV/phone/air conditioner maker TCL is dabbling in the AR glasses space, pitching something akin to Google Glass in a package that looks much more like a standard pair of specs. &#8220;Holographic optical waveguide technology&#8221; pushes visuals onto the lens and into your field of view, and their concept video above promises touch-based controls built into the frames.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Baseball is like a laboratory for advanced statistical analysis, and businesses could learn a lot from watching how the sport deals with expanding datasets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In December 2014 I wrote a post titled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/28/finding-the-elusive-big-wisdom-in-big-data/">Finding the elusive big wisdom in big data</a>. We have made big advances since then in storing, processing and generally handling large volumes of data in a digital context, but humans still have trouble when it comes to reliably finding relevant nuggets that can improve business outcomes. I&#8217;m revisiting the idea to see how far we&#8217;ve come and how far we still have to go.</p>
<p>Baseball is one of the best examples of how data can impact a business. The book and movie <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393324815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Moneyball&#8221;</a> showed how Oakland Athletics&#8217; GM Billy Beane changed the sport by introducing advanced statistical analysis instead of simply relying on reports from human scouts. Today, baseball is ruled by analysts as much as experienced baseball professionals — but could there be too much data?</p>
<p>Alex Spier writing in the Boston Globe&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/25/sports/examining-how-teams-treated-luxury-tax-threshold-baseballs-recently-expired-collective-bargaining-agreement/">Sunday Baseball Notes column</a> recently pointed out that Boston Red Sox Manager Alex Cora will have 11 coaches on staff this year for 26 players. Compare that with Terry Francona in 2011, who had six for 25, and you can see the number has nearly doubled.</p>
<p>Spier attributes this in part to the growing amount of data that teams are collecting, which requires more people to observe, interpret, and implement a plan to leverage. As Spier wrote, &#8220;The result? Several teams now feature three hitting coaches, and staffs keep growing in an effort to distill the mountains of information into a digestible form for the 26 players on a roster.&#8221;</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Baseball is like a laboratory for advanced statistical analysis, and businesses could learn a lot from watching how the sport deals with expanding datasets.</p>
<p>Companies shovel data into data lakes, tinker with machine learning models, and use this information to make decisions, but they still face fundamental decisions every day that involve their ever-growing mountain of information. Sure, machines and software can help sort it out — indeed, they are getting better at it — but anyone who has dealt with poorly targeted advertising or email marketing knows there&#8217;s much work to be done.</p>

<p>Deepak Jeevankumer, managing director at Dell Technologies Capital, says the difference in play now compared to 2014 is that companies now are focused on getting insights to the people who need it faster. &#8220;Big Data has become less relevant than &#8216;fast data.&#8217; E-commerce shoppers, streaming media consumers, gamers, stock/crypto traders and enterprise marketeers are demanding fast insights and fast knowledge,&#8221; Jeevankumer told me.</p>
<p>He believes data needs to be analyzed at its source while streaming, and in real-time after a query is created, and that startups that create solutions that allow companies (and baseball teams) to do this will be more successful in the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IBM could be looking to sell the Watson Health division for a mere $1 billion, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/ibm-tries-to-sell-watson-health-again-82f691a4-ab81-4b2b-a5bb-13a7556c8ef1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Axios report</a>. The question is why is IBM running away from the healthcare vertical just as it seems to be heating up, and for such a low price?</p>
<p>Just last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/">Oracle spent $28 billion</a> to buy digital health records company Cerner. Last spring, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">Microsoft spent close to $20 billion</a> to buy Nuance, which is used heavily in the medical industry, boasting 10,000 healthcare customers. That&#8217;s huge money, suggesting that enterprise companies are looking to embrace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-joins-microsoft-in-spending-big-to-dominate-healthcare-vertical/">the healthcare vertical</a> and willing to spend big bucks to do it.</p>
<p>IBM <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2909534/ibm-launches-watson-health-global-analytics-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched Watson Health in April 2015</a> to much fanfare. It was supposed to take Watson, IBM&#8217;s artificial intelligence platform, and put it to work on healthcare problems. The argument went something like this. Even the best doctor can&#8217;t read all of the literature out there, but a computer can do it quickly, and could come up with suggested courses of action to augment the doctor&#8217;s expertise and produce better outcomes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255245" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It then did what IBM does when it focuses on something. It opened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/10/ibm-watson-health-unit-begins-to-take-shape/">up a fancy headquarters</a> in Cambridge in September that year. It also began announcing partnerships. It checked all the boxes, partnering with the likes of CVS, Apple and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
<p>Then it started buying companies. The first acquisitions were medical data companies, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/13/ibm-acquires-health-tech-startups-explorys-and-phytel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phytel and Explorys</a>. That was part of a pattern. Next came <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/06/ibm-buying-merge-healthcare-for-1b-to-bring-medical-image-analysis-to-watson-health/">$1 billion for Merge Healthcare</a>, a company that would provide medical imaging data. Later it would make its most expensive purchase, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/18/ibm-acquiring-truven-health-analytics-for-2-6-billion-and-adding-it-to-watson-health/">Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion</a>. In total it spent $4 billion, according to reports, which seems kind of modest now compared to what Oracle and Microsoft just spent, but it was a lot of money in 2015 and 2016 when it was gearing up.</p>
<p>All of this was about taking a data-centric approach to feed Watson Health&#8217;s machine learning models. For whatever reason, it didn&#8217;t really work as planned, but it was a big part of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/ginni-rometty-leaves-complex-legacy-as-she-steps-away-as-ibm-ceo/"> former CEO Ginni Rometty&#8217;s</a> plan to modernize the company by focusing on areas like cloud and AI.</p>
<p>Rometti was optimistic when she spoke to the <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/dont-try-to-protect-the-past" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Business Review in 2017</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our moon shot is bringing world-class health care to every corner of the world. Some of that is already happening. Watson is being trained by the best cancer centers in the world and then being rolled out across hundreds of hospitals in China and India. Some of those areas have just one oncologist for maybe 1,600 patients. People in those regions have had no chance of getting world-class health care. Now they can, with Watson as an oncology adviser assisting doctors with decision making. And this is just the start.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Rometti <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/arvind-krishna-will-replace-ginni-rometty-as-ibm-ceo-in-april/">left in 2019</a>, and her replacement, Arvind Krishna, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">has different priorities</a>. He <a href="https://www.axios.com/ibm-tries-to-sell-watson-health-again-82f691a4-ab81-4b2b-a5bb-13a7556c8ef1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Axios</a> that broad healthcare vision might have been too optimistic. That could explain why IBM is looking to get out, Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research tells me.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM is really focussing on its hybrid cloud strategy. In the process it is trying to get rid of all assets that divert attention and capital, as well as carrying the risk of reputational damage. Watson Health certainly qualifies for all three, so it comes as no surprise that IBM may divest the unit,&#8221; Mueller said.</p>
<p>While IBM will likely continue to pursue healthcare business in other ways across the company, even if it ends up dumping Watson Health, it would have to be considered a failed strategy after pouring so much money into it and getting so little back. Of course, it still qualifies as a rumor, even if it wouldn&#8217;t be a huge surprise to see it come to pass.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The US International Trade Commission has <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/system/files/secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1191_notice01062022sgl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">agreed</a> with Sonos&#8217; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-sonos-sues-google.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">claims</a> that Google had infringed on its speaker and cast patents. It issued its initial decision back in August, and this finalizes its ruling, which prohibits Google from importing products found to have violated Sonos&#8217; intellectual properties. Since Google manufactures its products in China, that means it won&#8217;t be able to gets them shipped to the US when the import ban takes effect in 60 days.</p>
<p>Sonos sued Google in 2020 over five patents, which include one that details a technology allowing wireless speakers to sync with one another. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/technology/google-sonos-patents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a> notes, the products affected include Google&#8217;s Home smart speakers, Pixel phones and computers, as well as Chromecast devices. While Google is facing an import ban, a spokesperson said that the tech giant doesn&#8217;t expect the ruling to interrupt its ability to import and sell devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we disagree with today&#8217;s decision, we appreciate that the International Trade Commission has approved our modified designs,&#8221; the spokesperson told <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-violated-sonos-patents" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Protocol</em></a>. &#8220;We will seek further review and continue to defend ourselves against Sonos&#8217; frivolous claims about our partnership and intellectual property.&#8221; The commission didn&#8217;t challenge those alternative designs in its final decision, which means Google can implement them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255254" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In fact, the Nest team has recently <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Upcoming-Speaker-Group-changes/ba-p/77811" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">announced</a> some changes to speaker groups, which it says is &#8220;due to a recent legal ruling.&#8221; The most notable change is that, going forward, users will no longer be able to adjust the volume of all speakers in a group all at once. They&#8217;d have to adjust each speaker individually instead.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus admitted that there&#8217;s a possibility that &#8220;Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed.&#8221; However, he said the tech giant&#8217;s products will still &#8220;infringe many dozens of Sonos patents&#8221; — that is, unless Google pays Sonos royalties for its technologies.</p>
<p>His whole statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We appreciate that the ITC has definitively validated the five Sonos patents at issue in this case and ruled unequivocally that Google infringes all five. That is an across the board win that is surpassingly rare in patent cases and underscores the strength of Sonos’s extensive patent portfolio and the hollowness of Google’s denials of copying. These Sonos patents cover Sonos&#8217; groundbreaking invention of extremely popular home audio features, including the set up for controlling home audio systems, the synchronization of multiple speakers, the independent volume control of different speakers, and the stereo pairing of speakers.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>There is a possibility that Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed. But while Google may sacrifice consumer experience in an attempt to circumvent this importation ban, its products will still infringe many dozens of Sonos patents, its wrongdoing will persist, and the damages owed Sonos will continue to accrue. Alternatively, Google can —as other companies have already done — pay a fair royalty for the technologies it has misappropriated.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">formerly Facebook</a>, is tinkering around with how it tells users about their privacy options. The company has switched up where this information lives and how it&#8217;s explained a number of times over the years and now appears to be centralizing some privacy FAQs and controls in one place across its family of apps.</p>
<p>The new privacy center, called <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/01/introducing-privacy-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Center</a>, is a test available to some U.S.-based Facebook desktop users for now but will roll out to &#8220;more people and apps in the coming months.&#8221; If you&#8217;re in the limited test, you can find the new privacy information center in the Privacy section of the Settings menu. As it stands, privacy settings are divided among Facebook&#8217;s Privacy Shortcuts and Privacy Checkup menus, which are far from ideal but still an improvement over how the platform used to handle these controls.</p>
<p>The new privacy center will break things down into five categories: Security, Sharing, Collection, Use and Ads. Meta is still pushing the idea of &#8220;privacy education&#8221; with the changes, a kind of shorthand way of saying that if you don&#8217;t go to the trouble of sorting through all of this stuff then it&#8217;s on you when the company puts your personal data to good use.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255244" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook has historically offered users byzantine, difficult to navigate privacy controls, often with the most important settings buried in menus. That&#8217;s improved some, but regardless of what it says these days, Meta still has a vested interest in keeping its users sharing as much data as possible. That position is made abundantly clear by the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/apple-privacy-changes-anti-competitive-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conspicuous objections to Apple&#8217;s iOS ad tracking changes</a>, which limited the ability of apps to follow user behavior — a clear win for consumer privacy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not realistic to assume that most people would systemically trudge through this information, but it&#8217;s probably worth knowing where it all lives, just in case.</p>
