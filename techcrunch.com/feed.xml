										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Can reading glasses actually be cool? A new eyewear company called <a href="https://www.cheeterzclub.com/">Cheeterz Club</a> thinks so. The startup is working to change the perception of reading glasses from being just cheap, disposable items you pick up from a rotating display rack at your local drug store to being something you&#8217;d actually be proud to wear. To do so, the company is designing its glasses with quality lenses and frames in range of styles, while still keeping the pricing affordable.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; whose name is a reference to the slang term for glasses, &#8220;cheaters,&#8221; &#8212; was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferleefarrelly/">Jennifer Farrelly</a>, whose background includes work in advertising and sales at companies like Uber and Virool.</p>
<p>She said the idea to make a better set of readers came to her because she found herself frustrated by the current options on the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all started a few years ago. My friends were posting on social media these really depressing comments and posts like: &#8216;I&#8217;m old and turning into my parents, this is awful.&#8217; And I [thought to myself] why does it have to be like that? I feel just as young today as I did ten years ago,&#8221; Farrelly explains. &#8220;Why are my friends and I feeling forced to feel old because of something that happens overnight?,&#8221; she says, of what felt like the sudden onset of middle age and the hardships it brings.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse, Farrelly says, is that when you finally make your way to the drugstore to pick out some reading glasses, all you&#8217;ll find are bad, plastic pairs that both look and feel cheap.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s even more demoralizing,&#8221; she adds.</p>

<p>So Farrelly teamed up with a former Warby Parker and Pair Eyewear Head of Product, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-zaro-4b88b05/">Lee Zaro</a>, to design a new line of more fashion-forward eyewear.</p>
<p>Zaro, who&#8217;s based in the L.A. area, immediately saw the opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drugstore reading glasses are typically poor in quality, and can feel like they are designed with our parents in mind, leaving a huge unmet need for sophisticated eyewear options,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When Jennifer approached me to help design her first line of eyewear, I knew it was a brilliant idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>To differentiate itself from lower-end readers, Cheeterz Club glasses are made with 100% acetate and feature spring hinges and stainless steel. The lenses, meanwhile, offer more clarity than is often found in reading glasses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196492" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196492" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196492" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kingsley-Noir-Frame-Blue-Fashion-Tint.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kingsley-Noir-Frame-Blue-Fashion-Tint.jpg 4898w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kingsley-Noir-Frame-Blue-Fashion-Tint.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kingsley-Noir-Frame-Blue-Fashion-Tint.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kingsley-Noir-Frame-Blue-Fashion-Tint.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kingsley-Noir-Frame-Blue-Fashion-Tint.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kingsley-Noir-Frame-Blue-Fashion-Tint.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kingsley-Noir-Frame-Blue-Fashion-Tint.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kingsley-Noir-Frame-Blue-Fashion-Tint.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196492" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cheeterz Club</p></div></p>
<p>Typically, ophthalmic plastic lens materials have an <a href="https://www.allentownoptical.com/abbe-value-interpretation/">Abbe value</a> &#8212; a measure of the degree at which light is dispersed or separated &#8212; between 30 and 58. The higher number offers better optical performance. Crown glass can have an Abbe value as high as 59, but polycarbonate readers (like <a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses/women">those</a> from Warby Parker, Farrelly notes) would have an Abbe value of 30. Cheeterz Club lenses, which are CR-39 lenses, are at at 58. This is a difference you can tell when trying the glasses on alongside your drugstore readers.</p>
<p>Cheeterz&#8217; lenses also offer 100% UVA/UVB protection, and are oil and water repellent. They can optionally be bought in one of eight fashion tints, from pink to blue, or in two sun shades. Consumers can also opt to add Blue Light coating to help with screen-induced eye fatigue or they can choose Progressive lenses, which combine distance vision with a reading lens.</p>
<p>Tints are an extra $10, Blue Light protection is $25, and Progressive lenses are $40.99 &#8212; lower than market rates.</p>
<p>At launch, Cheeterz Club offers 14 different styles ranging from traditional to the more modern, starting at $28.99.</p>
<p>Farrelly says finding the right price was key, because unlike regular glasses, consumers often buy multiple pairs of readers to leave around the house or car, pack in purses and bags, and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I break something that costs me a couple $100, I&#8217;d be really upset about it,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But at a drugstore price of under $30, I can have them in all sorts of colors and different tints.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Farrelly, making the startup a success goes beyond brining higher-quality reading glasses to market. It&#8217;s also about serving a demographic that often gets overlooked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Founders in their forties do not get representation, and it&#8217;s unfortunate. And there are also people in their forties and fifties that have disposable income and are looking for cute things. They&#8217;re spending so much money on facial creams and Botox,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but then you&#8217;re forced to put this really ugly pair of glasses on your face that make you feel bad about yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Cheeterz Club today is selling direct to the consumer, the company is talking to eye doctors, boutiques and others who may eventually resell for them, as more of a B2B model. It&#8217;s also testing selling on Amazon with one pair of Blue Light glasses.</p>
<p>Cheeterz Club plans to start discussing fundraising with seed investors later this fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A cybersecurity company says a popular smart home security system has a pair of vulnerabilities that can be exploited to disarm the system altogether.</p>
<p>Rapid7 found the vulnerabilities in the Fortress S03, a home security system that relies on Wi-Fi to connect cameras, motion sensors, and sirens to the internet, allowing owners to remotely monitor their home anywhere with a mobile app. The security system also uses a radio-controlled key fob to let homeowners arm or disarm their house from outside their front door.</p>
<p>But the cybersecurity company said the vulnerabilities include an unauthenticated API and an unencrypted radio signal that can be easily intercepted.</p>
<p>Rapid7 <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/08/31/cve-2021-3927-67-fortress-s03-wifi-home-security-system-vulnerabilities/">revealed details</a> of the two vulnerabilities on Tuesday after not hearing from Fortress in three months, the standard window of time that security researchers give to companies to fix bugs before details are made public. Rapid7 said its only acknowledgment of its email was when Fortress closed its support ticket a week later without commenting.</p>
<p>Fortress owner Michael Hofeditz opened but did not respond to several emails sent by TechCrunch with an email open tracker. An email from Bottone Riling, a Massachusetts law firm representing Fortress, called the claims &#8220;false, purposely misleading and defamatory,&#8221; but did not provide specifics that it claims are false, or if Fortress has mitigated the vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Rapid7 said that Fortress&#8217; unauthenticated API can be remotely queried over the internet without the server checking if the request is legitimate. The researchers said by knowing a homeowner&#8217;s email address, the server would return the device&#8217;s unique IMEI, which in turn could be used to remotely disarm the system.</p>
<p>The other flaw takes advantage of the unencrypted radio signals sent between the security system and the homeowner&#8217;s key fob. That allowed Rapid7 to capture and replay the signals for &#8220;arm&#8221; and &#8220;disarm&#8221; because the radio waves weren&#8217;t scrambled properly.</p>
<p>Vishwakarma said homeowners could add a <a href="https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308648">plus-tagged</a> email address with a long, unique string of letters and numbers in place of a password as a stand-in for a password. But there was little for homeowners to do for the radio signal bug until Fortress addresses it.</p>
<p>Fortress has not said if it has fixed or plans to fix the vulnerabilities. It&#8217;s not clear if Fortress is able to fix the vulnerabilities without replacing the hardware. It&#8217;s not known if Fortress builds the device itself or buys the hardware from another manufacturer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.makeheroes.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroes</a>, one of the new wave of startups aiming to build big e-commerce businesses by buying up smaller third-party merchants on Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, has raised another big round of funding to double down on that strategy. The London startup has picked up $200 million, money that it will mainly be using to snap up more merchants. Existing brands in its portfolio cover categories like baby, pets, sports, personal health and home and garden categories &#8212; some of them, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/PremiumCare/page/CF3D13DB-DE1D-457F-86BD-EF5986D5D991?ref_=ast_bln"><span class="s1">PremiumCare</span></a> dog chews, the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Onco-Baby-Car-Mirror-Premium/dp/B01FCMV5RM/"><span class="s1">Onco </span></a>baby car mirror, gardening tool brand <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/page/0764177E-B460-461A-B000-C896EBB85411/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;store_ref=SB_A0464928EPHUJ1W9RJD&amp;pd_rd_plhdr=t&amp;aaxitk=c01483ea12dbbccd69c08bf355e6dc96&amp;hsa_cr_id=5310671600502&amp;lp_asins=B01EWSK0AU,B01CMFGCXO,B00ZY4XA9K&amp;lp_query=davaon&amp;lp_slot=auto-sparkle-hsa-tetris&amp;ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_lsi4d_logo&amp;pd_rd_w=wxK1s&amp;pf_rd_p=8f637300-b537-4bcc-bb94-5f850cdda3da&amp;pd_rd_wg=HcpfO&amp;pf_rd_r=CEXC1MN0CWMNV0JFEH1A&amp;pd_rd_r=a9b941a1-c997-4aca-a8a4-695caf6fce3d"><span class="s1">Davaon</span></a> and wooden foot massager roller <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TheraFlow-Massager-Relieve-Plantar-Fasciitis/dp/B00SMJIYNG/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=theraflow&amp;qid=1630405705&amp;sr=8-5"><span class="s1">Theraflow</span></a>, category best-sellers &#8212; and the plan is to continue building up all of these verticals.</p>
<p>Crayhill Capital Management, a fund based out of New York, is providing the funding, and Riccardo Bruni &#8212; who co-founded the company with twin brother Alessio and third brother Giancarlo &#8212; said that the bulk of it will be going towards making acquisitions, and is therefore coming in the form of debt.</p>
<p>Raising debt rather than equity at this point is pretty standard for companies like Heroes. Heroes itself is pretty young: it launched less than a year ago, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2020</a>, with $65 million in funding, a round comprised of both equity and debt. Other investors in the startup include 360 Capital, Fuel Ventures and Upper 90.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Heroes is playing in what is rapidly becoming a very crowded field. Not only are there are tens of thousands of businesses leveraging Amazon&#8217;s extensive fulfillment network to sell goods on the e-commerce giant&#8217;s Marketplace; but some days it seems we are also rapidly approaching a state of nearly as many startups launching to consolidate these third-party sellers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Many a roll-up play follows a similar playbook, which goes like this: Amazon provides the Marketplace to sell goods to consumers, and the infrastructure to fulfill those orders, by way of <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulfillment By Amazon</a> and its Prime service. Meanwhile, the roll-up business &#8212; in this case Heroes &#8212; buys up a number of the stronger companies leveraging FBA and the Marketplace. Then, by consolidating them into a single tech platform that they have built, Heroes creates better economies of scale around better and more efficient supply chains, sharper machine learning and marketing and data analytics technology, and new growth strategies. </span></p>
<p>What is notable about Heroes, though &#8212; apart from the fact that it&#8217;s the first roll-up player to come out of the UK, and continues to be one of the bigger players in Europe &#8212; is that it doesn&#8217;t believe that the technology plays as important a role as having a solid relationship with the companies it&#8217;s targeting, key given that now the top Marketplace sellers are likely being feted by a number of companies as acquisition targets.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The tech is very important,&#8221; said Alessio in an interview. &#8220;It helps us build robust processes that tie all the systems together across multiple brands and marketplaces. But what we have is very different from a SaaS business. We are not building an app, and tech is not the core of what we do. From the acquisitions side, we believe that human interactions ultimately win. We don’t think tech can replace a strong acquisition process.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Heroes&#8217; three founder-brothers (two of them, Riccardo and Alessio, pictured above) have worked across a number of investment, finance and operational roles (the CVs include Merrill Lynch, EQT Ventures, Perella Weinberg Partners, Lazada, Nomura and Liberty Global) and they say there have been strong signs so far of its strategy working: of the brands that it has acquired since launching in November, they claim business (sales) has grown five-fold.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Collectively, the roll-up startups are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to fuel these efforts. Other recent hopefuls that have announced funding this year include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/suma-brands-raises-150m-to-acquire-more-third-party-brands-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suma Brands</a> ($150 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elevate-brands-banks-250m-to-roll-up-third-party-merchants-selling-on-amazons-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate Brands</a> ($250 million); <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a> ($775 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factory14</a> ($200 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a> (currently probably the biggest of them all in terms of reach and money raised and ambitions), <a href="https://heyday.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Razor Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>, Latin America’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainforest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una Brands</a> out of Asia. </span></p>
<p>The picture that is emerging across many of these operations is that many of these companies, Heroes included, do not try to make their particular approaches particularly more distinctive than those of their competitors, simply because &#8212; with nearly 10 million third-party sellers today on Amazon globally &#8212; the opportunity is likely big enough for all of them, and more, not least because of current market dynamics.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no secret that we were inspired by Thrasio and others,&#8221; Riccardo said. &#8220;Combined with Covid-19, there has been a massive acceleration of e-commerce across the continent.&#8221; It was that, plus the realization that the three brothers had the right e-commerce, fundraising and investment skills between them, that made them see what was a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; to tackle the opportunity, he continued. &#8220;So that is why we jumped into it.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the case of Heroes, while the majority of the funding will be used for acquisitions, it&#8217;s also planning to double headcount from its current 70 employees before the end of this year with a focus on operational experts to help run their acquired businesses. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2012, Whoop is far from a household name in the world of fitness trackers. But over the years, the company has attracted its share of converts. It hasn’t had any issue attracting venture capital over the years, either. Last time we checked in on the Boston-based company was in late-2019, when it raised $55 million. Now it’s back with a massive <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/whoop-raises-200-million-financing-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2-at-3-6-billion-valuation-301365153.html">$200 million raise</a>.</p>
<p>The Series F round brings Whoop’s total funding to nearly $405 million &#8212; a pretty massive investment for a company of its size. The round, led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2, puts the valuation at a jaw-dropping $3.6 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Additional investors include IVP, Cavu Venture Partners, Thursday Ventures, GP Bullhound, Accomplice, NextView Ventures and Animal Capital. They join a long list of former backers, including the National Football League Players Association, Jack Dorsey and a number of professional athletes.</p>
<p>The company’s targeting of athletes marks a strong contrast with leading consumer wearables like the Apple Watch and Fitbit. In fact, the company has a specific offering for sports teams, as well as solutions for businesses, healthcare and government/defense.</p>

<p>Whoop’s name made the rounds recently when Fitbit announced a “Daily Readiness Score” for the Charge 5, which many likened to the company’s more advanced analytics.</p>
<p>The company cites “rapid growth” in its membership offering over the past year as a motivation behind seeking additional funding. That was likely driven, in part, by the decision in 2019 to make the $500 wearable free, while focusing on a subscription service that starts at $18 a month for an 18-month membership (the shorter the membership, the more the monthly fee).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whoop is eying international expansion beyond the U.S. and using the massive influx of cash on R&amp;D for its hardware, software and analytics solutions. Money will also go toward expanding headcount, which is currently in excess of 500 (with nearly half of those employees having joined in the past year).</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to deepen our partnership with SoftBank as we grow internationally,&#8221; founder and CEO Will Ahmed said in a release. &#8220;While we have experienced amazing growth in the past year, the potential of our technology and the vast market for health monitoring remains largely untapped.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amsterdam-based challenger bank <a href="https://www.bunq.com">Bunq</a> is updating its service with a handful of new features. In addition to Dutch, German and French bank account numbers, existing and new users in Spain can now get a Spanish IBAN.</p>
<p>European IBANs are supposed to work across Europe. Your employer or internet provider can’t force you to get a local IBAN. And yet, that’s rarely the case. When you move to another European country, chances are the first thing you do is that you open a local bank account.</p>
<p>While European fintech companies have teamed up to create a lobbying effort called <a href="https://www.acceptmyiban.org">‘Accept my IBAN’</a>, some challenger banks, such as Bunq, are adding the ability to get local bank account numbers as an intermediary fix. Bunq users can also choose to associate IBANs from multiple European countries with their account. You have to pay a one-time fee of €9.99 every time you add a new local IBAN.</p>
<p>Bunq is also drawing inspiration from <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a>, <a href="https://wise.com">Wise</a>, <a href="https://vivid.money">Vivid Money</a> and others as you&#8217;ll soon be able to receive, convert and hold other currencies. For instance, if you’re going to a non-Euro country for an internship, you will be able to receive your salary on your Bunq account. Bunq is starting with USD accounts with plans to add more currencies down the road.</p>
<p>Other new features include the ability to receive reminders the day before a direct debit occurs, a subscription view that lets you view current subscriptions and when they’re set to expire, an improved search feature and the ability to automatically accept direct debits and payment requests from your friends — make sure you set up a limit before enabling that feature.</p>
<p>Bunq recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/european-challenger-bank-bunq-raises-228-million-at-1-9-billion-valuation/">announced plans</a> to raise $228 million (€193 million) at a $1.9 billion valuation (€1.6 billion). The investment round hasn’t been approved by the Netherlands’ banking regulator just yet. Bunq is currently operating in 29 European markets and has more than €&amp;billion in user deposits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apna, a 21-month-old startup that is helping millions of blue and gray-collar workers in India upskill themselves, find communities and land jobs, is inching closer to becoming the fastest tech firm in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market to become a unicorn.</p>
<p>Tiger Global is in advanced stages of talks to lead a $100 million round in <a href="https://apna.co">Apna</a>, according to four sources familiar with the matter. The proposed terms value the startup at over $1 billion, the sources said.</p>
<p>The round hasn&#8217;t closed yet so terms of the deal may change, some of the sources cautioned.</p>
<p>If the round materializes, Apna will become the youngest Indian startup to attain the much coveted unicorn status. The startup, which launched its app in December 2019, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/india-jobs-app-apna-raises-70-million/">valued at $570 million in its Series B financing round</a> in June this year. It will also be the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/apple-alum-jobs-app-apna-for-india-workers-raises-12-5-million/">third financing round</a> Apna would have secured in a span of less than seven months.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, an existing investor in Apna, didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment earlier this month. Apna founder and chief executive Nirmit Parikh, an Apple alum, declined to comment on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Indian cities are home to hundreds of millions of low-skilled workers who hail from villages in search of work. Many of them have lost their jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic that has slowed several economic activities in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p>Apna, whose name is inspired from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFGKJBPFdUA" data-reader-unique-id="8">a 2019 Bollywood song</a>, is building a scalable networking infrastructure so that these workers can connect to the right employers and secure jobs. On its eponymous Android app, users also upskill themselves, review their interview skills, and become eligible for more jobs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As of June this year, Apna had amassed over 10 million users and was facilitating more than 15 million job interviews each month. All jobs listed on the Apna platform are verified by the startup and free of cost for the candidates.</p>
<p data-reader-unique-id="17">The startup has also partnered with some of India’s leading public and private organizations and is providing support to the Ministry of Minority Affairs of India, National Skill Development Corporation and UNICEF YuWaah to provide better skilling and job opportunities to candidates.</p>
<p data-reader-unique-id="17">The investment talks further illustrate Tiger Global&#8217;s growing interest in India. The New York-headquartered firm has made several high-profile investments in India this year including in BharatPe, Gupshup, DealShare, Classplus, Urban Company, Coinswitch Kuber, and Groww.</p>
<p data-reader-unique-id="17">More than two dozen Indian startups have become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year, as several high-profile investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, and Falcon Edge have increased the pace of their investments in the world&#8217;s second most populous nation.</p>
<p data-reader-unique-id="17">Apna also counts Insight Partners, Lightspeed, and Sequoia Capital among its existing investors.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Startups are hard work, but the complexities of global supply chains can make running hardware companies especially difficult. Instead of existing within a codebase behind a screen, the key components of your hardware product can be scattered around the world, subject to the volatility of the global economy.</p>
<p>I’ve spent most of my career establishing global supply chains, setting up manufacturing lines for 3D printers, electric bicycles and home fitness equipment on the ground in Mexico, Hungary, Taiwan and China. I’ve learned the hard way that Murphy’s law is a constant companion in the hardware business.</p>
<p>But after more than a decade of work on three different continents, there are a few lessons I’ve learned that will help you avoid unnecessary mistakes.</p>
<h2>Expect cost fluctuations, especially in currency and shipping</h2>
<p>Shipping physical products is quite different from &#8220;shipping&#8221; code — you have to pay a considerable amount of money to transport products around the world. Of course, shipping costs become a line item like any other as they get baked into the overall business plan. The issue is that those costs can change monthly — sometimes drastically.</p>
<p>At this time last year, a shipping container from China cost $3,300. Today, it’s <a href="https://fbx.freightos.com/freight-index/FBX01">almost $18,000</a> — a more than fivefold increase in 12 months. It’s safe to assume that most 2020 business plans did not account for such a cost increase for a key line item.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Shipping a buggy hardware product can be exponentially costlier than shipping buggy software. Recalls, angry customers, return shipping and other issues can become existential problems.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Similar issues also arise with currency exchange rates. Contract manufacturers often allow you to maintain cost agreements for any fluctuations below 5%, but the dollar has dropped much more than 5% against the yuan compared to a year ago, and hardware companies have been forced to renegotiate their manufacturing contracts.</p>
<p>As exchange rates become less favorable and shipping costs increase, you have two options: Operate with lower margins, or pass along the cost to the end customer. Neither choice is ideal, but both are better than going bankrupt.</p>
<p>The takeaway is that when you set up your business, you need to prepare for these possibilities. That means operating with enough margin to handle increased costs, or with the confidence that your end customer will be able to handle a higher price.</p>
<h2>Overorder critical parts</h2>
<p>Over the past year, many businesses have lost billions of dollars in market value because they didn’t order enough semiconductors. As the owner of a hardware company, you will encounter similar risks.</p>
<p>The supply for certain components, like computer chips, can be limited, and shortages can arise quickly if demand increases or supply chains get disrupted. It’s your job to analyze potential choke points in your supply chain and create redundancies around them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The digital transformation currently sweeping society has likely reached your favorite local restaurant.</p>
<p>Since 2013, Boston-based Toast has offered bars and eateries a software platform that lets them manage orders, payments and deliveries.</p>
<p>Over the last year, its customers have processed more than $38 billion in gross payment volume, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">Alex Wilhelm analyzed the company&#8217;s S-1 for The Exchange</a> with great interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toast was last valued at just under $5 billion when it last raised, per Crunchbase data,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;And folks are saying that it could be worth $20 billion in its debut. Does that square with the numbers?&#8221;</p>

<p>In August 2006, AWS activated its EC2 cloud-based virtual computer, a milestone in the cloud infrastructure giant&#8217;s development.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really can’t overstate what Amazon was able to accomplish,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>In the 15 years since, EC2 has enabled clients of any size to test and run their own applications on AWS&#8217; virtual machines.</p>
<p>To learn more about a fundamental technological shift that &#8220;would help fuel a whole generation of startups,&#8221; Ron interviewed EC2 VP Dave Brown, who built and led the Amazon EC2 Frontend team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Most managers agree that OKRs foster transparency and accountability, but running a team effectively has different challenges when workers are attending all-hands meetings from their kitchen tables.</p>
<p>Instead of just discussing key metrics before board meetings or performance reviews, make them part of the day-to-day culture, recommends Jeremy Epstein, Gtmhub&#8217;s CMO.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strengthen your team by creating authentic workplace transparency using numbers as a universal language and providing meaning behind your team’s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many founders must overcome a few emotional hurdles before they’re comfortable pitching a potential investor face-to-face.</p>
<p>To alleviate that pressure, Unicorn Capital founder Evan Fisher recommends that entrepreneurs use pre-pitch meetings to build and strengthen relationships before asking for a check:</p>
<p>“This is the ‘we actually aren’t looking for money; we just want to be friends for now’ pitch that gets you on an investor’s radar so that when it’s time to raise your next round, they’ll be far more likely to answer the phone because they actually know who you are.”</p>
<p>Pre-pitches are good for more than curing the jitters: These conversations help founders get a better sense of how VCs think and sometimes lead to serendipitous outcomes.</p>
<p>“Investors are opportunists by necessity,” says Fisher, “so if they like the cut of your business’s jib, you never know — the FOMO might start kicking hard.”</p>

<p>Customer engagement software company Freshworks&#8217; S-1 filing depicts a company that&#8217;s experiencing accelerating revenue growth, &#8220;a great sign for the health of its business,&#8221; reports Alex Wilhelm in this morning&#8217;s The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most companies see their growth rates decline as they scale, as larger denominators make growth in percentage terms more difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Studying the company&#8217;s SEC filing, he found that &#8220;Freshworks isn’t a company where we need to cut it lots of slack, as we might with an adjusted EBITDA number. It is going public ready for Big Kid metrics.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve had visionary investors onstage before, and we&#8217;ve had science fiction authors onstage — but never at the same time, let alone a pair who collaborated on a unique book of stories and essays that make an optimistic prediction of our AI-infused future. Sinovation founder Kai-Fu Lee and author of &#8220;Waste Tide&#8221; and others Chen Qiufan will join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=kaifuleepost&amp;display=true">Disrupt (September 21-23)</a> for a discussion of the fiction and fact of today&#8217;s hottest technology.</p>
<p>Lee, born in Taiwan, attended CMU and obtained a PhD in computer science, working initially on speech recognition before working for Apple, SGI and Microsoft, then establishing Google China as its president. His research and investment company, Sinovation (originally Innovation Works) has been his focus since its founding in 2009, and he has grown to become a leading mind and influential figure in AI.</p>
<p>When we last spoke with Lee, at Disrupt SF 2018, he emphasized that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/china-is-beating-the-us-on-ai-says-noted-investor-kaifu-lee/">China was catching up to the U.S. on AI research</a>, and had surpassed it in some ways. And certainly his own investments have contributed to that. Since then, as someone who thinks frequently about what the future holds, he has found a kindred spirit in Chen Qiufan.</p>
<p>Qiufan is a Chinese author whose 2013 novel &#8220;Waste Tide&#8221; propelled him to literary fame, though like many authors, that wasn&#8217;t enough to make him quit his day job until a few years later (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/science-fiction-writer-china-chen-qiufan/">Wired only just ran a profile on him</a>). But by that time he had attracted the attention of Lee, who proposed a novel project: a collaborative book where the two would put their heads together to create a fictitious future informed by fact and realistic extrapolation.</p>
<p>The result is &#8220;AI 2041&#8221;: 10 stories by Qiufan set in the titular year, all over the world, with people from all walks of life encountering AI in the many ways that the authors speculate it may come to shape society over the next two decades. Each is followed by an explanatory essay by Lee that goes into the technical aspects and why they might lead to that future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a full review of the book ahead of the event, but I can certainly say that it&#8217;s unlike any collection I&#8217;ve read before. Each story is independent but takes place in something like a shared world, and each illustrates a potential application, conflict or change in thinking that AI could lead to. And, importantly, the AI is recognizable as descended directly from existing technologies.</p>
<p>For instance, one story concerns a talented deepfake creator working out of Lagos, one who knows the ins and outs of generative adversarial networks, image inspection, media pathways and so on. He&#8217;s tasked with creating a video of a long-dead celebrity that fools not just people watching it but the hosting service&#8217;s automated scanners, the government&#8217;s facial recognition algorithms and all the rest — but he begins to suspect there&#8217;s an unsavory motive behind it all (I won&#8217;t spoil the rest).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What follows the story is Lee&#8217;s essay on GANs, facial recognition and deepfakes that explains the concepts in an understandable but not patronizing way, then explores the risks and benefits in a non-narrative way. It helps ground the stories as real possibilities, not just imagined situations.</p>
<p>With both Qiufan and Lee onstage (virtually this time), the discussion of the book and the issues it brings up should be a lively one — not least because it will be moderated by yours truly. But to catch this session, you&#8217;ll need to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=kaifuleepost&amp;display=true">grab a pass to attend Disrupt</a> happening September 21-23. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=kaifuleepost&amp;display=true">Get yours today</a> for less than $100 for a limited time!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is making it easier for brands and agencies to work with the influencers using its service. The company is rolling out a new &#8220;TikTok Creator Marketplace API,&#8221; which allows marketing companies to integrate more directly with TikTok&#8217;s Creator Marketplace, the video app&#8217;s in-house influencer marketing platform.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://creatormarketplace.tiktok.com/">Creator Marketplace website</a>, <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital/tiktok-users-are-surprised-find-themselves-ads-app/2204996">launched</a> in late 2019, marketers have been able to discover top TikTok personalities for their brand campaigns, then create and manage those campaigns and track their performance.</p>
<p>The new API, meanwhile, allows partnered marketing companies to access TikTok&#8217;s first-party data about audience demographics, growth trends, best-performing videos, and real-time campaign reporting (e.g. views, likes, shares, comments, engagement, etc.) for the first time.</p>
<p>They can then bring this data back into their own platforms, to augment the insights they&#8217;re already providing to their own customer base.</p>
<p>TikTok is not officially announcing the API until later in September, but it is allowing its alpha partners to discuss their early work.</p>
<p>One such partner is <a href="https://captiv8.io/">Capitv8</a>, which tested the API with a <a href="https://nrf.com/resources/top-retailers/top-50-global-retailers/top-50-global-retailers-2021">NRF top 50 retailer</a> on one of their first TikTok campaigns. The retailer wanted to discover a diverse and inclusive group of TikTok creators to partner with on a new collaboration and wanted help with launching its own TikTok channel. Captiv8 says the branded content received nearly 10 million views, and the campaign resulted in a &#8220;significant increase&#8221; in several key metrics, which performed about the Nielsen average. This included familiarity (+4% above average), affinity (+6%), purchase intent (+7%) and recommendation intent (+9%).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196311" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196311" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196311" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/creator-marketplace.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="341" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/creator-marketplace.jpg 3300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/creator-marketplace.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/creator-marketplace.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/creator-marketplace.jpg?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/creator-marketplace.jpg?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/creator-marketplace.jpg?resize=1536,770 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/creator-marketplace.jpg?resize=2048,1026 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/creator-marketplace.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196311" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok Creator Marketplace website</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Capitv8 is now working with TikTok&#8217;s API to pull in audience demographics, to centralize influencer offers and activations, and to provide tools to boost branded content and monitor campaign performance. On that last front, the API allows the company to pull in real-time metrics from the TikTok Creator Marketplace API &#8212; which means Capitv8 is now one of only a handful of third-party companies with access to TikTok first-party data.</p>
<p>Another early alpha partner is <a href="https://www.influential.co/">Influential</a>, who shared it&#8217;s also leveraging the API to access first-party insights on audience demographics, growth trends, best-performing videos, and more, to help its customer base of Fortune 1000 brands to identify the right creators for both native and paid advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>One partner it worked with was DoorDash, who launched multiple campaigns on TikTok with Influential&#8217;s help. It&#8217;s also planning to work with McDonald&#8217;s USA on several new campaigns that will run this year, including those focused on the chain&#8217;s new Crispy Chicken Sandwich and the return of Spicy McNuggets.</p>
<p>Other early alpha partners include <a href="https://www.whalar.com/">Whalar</a> and <a href="https://www.inca-global.com/">INCA</a>. The latter&#8217;s integration stems from the larger <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-wpp-news">TikTok global partnership with WPP</a>, announced in February. That deal provided WPP agencies with early access to new advertising products marketing API integrations, and new AR offerings, among other things.</p>
<p>Creator marketplaces are now common to social media platforms with large influencer communities as this has become a standard way to advertise to online consumers, particular the younger generation. Facebook today offers its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/introducing-brand-collabs-manager">Brands Collabs Manager</a>, for both Facebook and <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/helping-creators-turn-their-passion-into-a-living">Instagram</a>; YouTube has <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-youtube-brandconnect-platform-creators-and-brands-collaborate/">BrandConnect</a>; while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/snap-to-launch-a-new-creator-marketplace-this-month-initially-focused-on-lens-creators/">Snapchat recently announced</a> a marketplace to connect brands with Lens creators. These type of in-house platforms make it easier for marketers to work with the wider influencer community by offering trusted data on metrics that matter to brands&#8217; own ROI, rather than relying on self-reported data from influencers or on data they have to manually collect themselves. And as campaigns run, marketers can compare how well their partnered creators are able to drive results to inform their future collaborations.</p>
<p>TikTok isn&#8217;t making a formal announcement about its new API at this time, telling TechCrunch the technology is still in pilot testing phases for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creators are the lifeblood of our platform, and we&#8217;re constantly thinking of new ways to make it easy for them to connect and collaborate with brands. We’re thrilled to be integrating with an elite group of trusted partners to help brands discover and work with diverse creators who can share their message in an authentic way,&#8221; said Melissa Yang, TikTok&#8217;s Head of Ecosystem Partnerships, in a statement provided to select marketing company partners.</p>
<p><em>Update, 8/31/21, 3:22 PM ET: INCA is currently using the API in the U.S. and U.K. An earlier version said it was U.K. only, based on information provided by TikTok. We&#8217;ve since corrected. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[African startups also increased from 10 in the winter batch to 15 this time around, a record for African startups in a single YC cohort.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Y Combinator&#8217;s summer batch of 2021 features 377 startups from 47 countries. It&#8217;s the 33rd Demo Day of the well-known accelerator and holds the largest cohort yet. YC S20 had 198 startups, so that&#8217;s a 90% increase from last year.</p>
<p>About half of the companies represented are based outside the U.S. The countries with the most representatives (aside from the U.S.) include India, with 33 startups; the U.K., with 18 startups; Mexico with 17; Singapore with 12; and Canada and Brazil, 11 each.</p>
<p>While the Demo Day for this year&#8217;s winter batch was held in a day, it&#8217;s two days for this summer batch. Today, 189 companies will pitch, while the rest will pitch tomorrow.</p>
<p>African startups also increased from 10 in the winter batch to 15 this time around, a record for African startups in a single YC cohort.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the largest batch we have ever funded and it&#8217;s about 50% international. As a result, it is not surprising that this is the largest cohort from Africa,&#8221; Y Combinator managing director and group arptner Michael Seibel told TechCrunch when asked if any extra factor contributed to the rise in accepted African startups.</p>
<p>Another valid reason for the uptick could be that YC is getting more applications from Africa due to the recent success stories of Paystack and Flutterwave. At least, that&#8217;s the view shared by Kat Mañalac, the head of Outreach at YC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alumni are always the best spokespeople and representatives for YC. A lot of African founders (and future founders) I&#8217;ve spoken to were encouraged by seeing Paystack do so well and get acquired. The success of a lot of our African alumni are inspiring more African teams to apply,&#8221; she told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nigeria leads the way again with five startups, while Egypt has four, Morocco has two, and Kenya, Ghana, Zambia and South Africa each have one. Here&#8217;s the list of African startups that made it to YC S21 in alphabetical order.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amenli.com/">Amenli</a> (Egypt)</strong></p>
<p>Africa has the lowest insurance penetrations globally. In Egypt, the insurance penetration rate stands at a minuscule 1%.</p>
<p>Amenli, founded by Shady El Tohfa and Adham Nauman in 2020, is addressing an untapped $2 billion market, being the first licensed online insurance broker in the country.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://chari.co/">Chari</a> (Morocco)</strong></p>
<p>A wave of disruption of digitizing informal retail stores is sweeping across emerging markets this year, and Chari is joining in on the action.</p>
<p>Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat founded Chari in 2020. The company allows traditional retailers in Morocco and some parts of North Africa to order consumer goods via its platform and handles free delivery to their stores. Chari has a fintech side by providing these retailers with credit.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://fingo.africa/">Fingo</a> (Kenya)</strong></p>
<p>Neobanks have taken the world by storm and Africa is the last frontier for this brand of fintech innovation. Fingo is providing an alternative brand of banking to African millennials, starting from Kenya.</p>
<p>Founded by Kiiru Muhoya Gitari Tirima James da Costa and Ian Njuguna in 2020, the digital bank claims to offer fees 90% cheaper than traditional banks in Kenya, among other services.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.floatpays.co.za/">FloatPays</a> (South Africa)</strong></p>
<p>In South Africa, up to 5 million employees borrow money to meet their monthly needs when they exhaust their salaries. However, the lending options for these employees come with outrageous interest rates.</p>
<p>Simon Ward founded FloatPays in 2019 as an on-demand wage access platform to help employees access, spend, save and manage their money.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.freterium.com/">Freterium</a> (Morocco)</strong></p>
<p>Managers of delivery businesses handle hundreds or thousands of delivery points every day. With a fleet made up of many trucks or vans, there&#8217;s a need to drop a delivery plan for each at different locations daily. How do they optimize for costs and efficiency at the same time?</p>
<p>Enter Freterium. The company allows contractors, manufacturers, distributors and logisticians to plan and optimize their B2B or B2C shipments while providing a cloud platform for real-time visibility of shipments, logistics infrastructure and seamless collaboration that breaks down traditional organizational silos. Omar El Kouhene and Mehdi Cherif Alami founded Freterium in 2018.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://infiuss.com/">Infiuss Health</a> (Nigeria)</strong></p>
<p>A large number of Africans are exempt from clinical research studies due to time constraints. Per reports, it can take up to ten months to conduct such studies in these climes.</p>
<p>Infiuss Health says it is building a decentralized platform for remote research and clinical trials in Africa. How? By connecting researchers directly to patients who want to participate in clinical research studies in less than a week.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Melissa Bime and Mbah Charles in 2020.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://lemonade.finance/">Lemonade Finance</a> (Nigeria)</strong></p>
<p>There are millions of African immigrants in Europe and North America. Some have established businesses in both these regions and also in Africa.</p>
<p>In another digital banking play, Lemonade Finance provides multi-currency accounts for these migrants to enable seamless transactions and banking. The company was founded by Rian Cochran and Ridwan Olalere in 2020</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://mechoautotech.com/">Mecho Autotech</a> (Nigeria)</strong></p>
<p>Repairing one&#8217;s vehicle can be a painstaking process in Africa due to pricing and quality issues. The latter is because many of these professionals (mechanics) are unvetted.</p>
<p>Ayoola Akinkunmi and Olusegun Owoade started Mecho Autotech in 2021 as an on-demand auto maintenance and repairs platform. Mecho Autotech has created a network of vetted mechanics, and via an app, car owners can book and pay for their services.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.odiggo.com.eg/en">Odiggo</a> (Egypt)</strong></p>
<p>Like its predecessor on this list, Odiggo connects car owners with mobile mechanics in the Middle East. On the platform, car owners can also access extra services, which include car washing and maintenance.</p>
<p>Although Odiggo lists as a Dubai-based company on the YC database, it has origins in Egypt and launched operations first in the North African country.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://payhippo.africa/">Payhippo</a> (Nigeria)</strong></p>
<p>Access to credit is still very much a problem to the millions of small and medium businesses in Nigeria, which make up most of the country&#8217;s businesses.</p>
<p>Founded by Zach Bijesse, Uche Nnadi and Chioma Okotcha in 2019, Payhippo provides loans to businesses that couldn&#8217;t ordinarily get loans or credit cards from banks or other financial institutions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.pylonump.com/">Pylon</a> (Egypt)</strong></p>
<p>Water and electricity distribution companies face losses from leakages and thefts when opening new revenue streams in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Pylon acts as an infrastructure management platform for these distribution companies and helps to reduce these losses. It was founded in 2017 by Ahmed Ashour and Omar Radi.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.shipblu.com/">ShipBlu</a> (Egypt)</strong></p>
<p>When merchants start to grow their e-commerce businesses, it can be difficult to manage the end-to-end delivery and fulfilment needs. In Egypt, several platforms are already offering solutions to this ever-growing need, and ShipBlu is adding to that list.</p>
<p>Founded by Ahmed ElKawass, Abdelrahman Hosny and Ali Nasser in 2020, ShipBlu claims to offer a full suite of delivery services for e-commerce merchants from overnight to delivery to five- to seven-day delivery.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://suplias.com/">Suplias</a> (Nigeria)</strong></p>
<p>Another digitizing-informal-retail-stores play, this time from Nigeria. Suplias is a B2B marketplace where mom-and -op stores in Africa buy inventory directly from manufacturers using a mobile app.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Stephen Igwue, Michael Adesanya and Sefa Ikyaator in 2019.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://union54.com/">Union54</a> (Zambia)</strong></p>
<p>African fintechs are in the business of providing virtual and physical cards to their customers. However, it doesn&#8217;t come easy and cheap when done in partnership with banks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disrupt is right around the corner, and this year the show is packed to the brim with incredible panels and conversations, an absolutely <em>stacked</em> Startup Battlefield cohort of companies launching on our stage, investor insights and a virtual expo hall <em>full</em> of exciting new products and services in the Startup Alley.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait! Literally. So we&#8217;re giving you guys a sneak peek at some of the startups you might see at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> in upcoming episodes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, the Extra Crunch Live crew sits down with founders and the investors who finance them to learn how they decided to partner with one another and, ultimately, how startups can get to &#8220;yes&#8221; when fundraising. In the latter half of the episode, those same guests give live feedback to folks in the audience who come on our virtual stage and pitch their products.</p>
<p>Truth be told, everyone loves a good pitch-off. So in these upcoming Startup Alley Edition episodes of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;re turning the entire episode into a pitch-off. SUA companies will come on stage, one at a time, and have exactly 60 seconds to get us excited about their startup. But it wouldn&#8217;t be a true pitch-off without some expert feedback.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the investors joining us on these episodes to share their insights and wisdom with both the startups and the audience.</p>
<p><a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-w-neil-sequeira-defyvc-and-stacey-bishop-scaleventurepartners?ref=2fbb5a569df1">On September 1, we&#8217;ll be joined by Neil Sequeira, founder at defy.vc, as well as Stacey Bishop, partner at Scale Venture Partners.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freshworks, a customer engagement software company with roots in both California in the United States and Tamil Nadu in India, is going public. Its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001544522/000162828021017717/freshworkss-1.htm">S-1 filing</a> paints the picture of a company scaling rapidly, with improving profitability as it matures. However, to understand the company&#8217;s numbers, we&#8217;ll have to peel away certain costs for a clear picture.</p>
<p>The Exchange spoke with Freshworks CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgirish">Girish Mathrubootham</a> a few weeks ago about his company, a conversation that in hindsight we timed rather well. We&#8217;ll lean on notes from the call as we parse Mathrubootham&#8217;s IPO filing.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Quite a lot of venture capital is riding on Freshworks&#8217; IPO going well. The company raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/freshworks/company_financials">hundreds of millions of dollars while private</a>, per Crunchbase data, including a $150 million Series H in late 2019 that valued the company at around $3.5 billion. Its investor list includes Accel, Tiger, Sequoia and Capital G.</p>

<h2>Quick notes on product</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the numbers, let&#8217;s discuss Freshworks&#8217; historical product work.</p>
<p>The company started life with a single piece of software called Freshdesk. Freshdesk was born after the company&#8217;s CEO struggled with poor customer service when trying to return a broken television.</p>
<p>Per Mathrubootham, he felt like there were more avenues than ever for customers to reach companies, and that the business market was evolving in a way that gave customers more clout in how brands were perceived. So, Freshdesk brought together a host of customer contact methods, including social media, which at the time was a more nascent market category.</p>
<p>Freshworks later noticed that some of its customers were using its customer service software to offer IT support to their own employees. From that observation, the company built Freshservice, a version of its original product, but tuned for internal use. The company later built out sales tools and, more recently, a unified database for customer data. The latter allows companies using Freshworks software to have a single record for each customer across marketing and sales interactions, which it intends to extend to support communications as well.</p>
<p>All that&#8217;s to say that Freshworks has a product that it can sell to small companies that may need a single piece of its larger product mix, and lots more software that it can upsell to those customers. And it has a product suite it can sell to larger companies as well.</p>
<p>So how has the company performed in the market? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.osanasalud.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osana Salud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to transform the healthcare infrastructure in Latin America, has closed on a $20 million Series A round of funding led by General Catalyst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Argentina-based, yet fully remote, startup was founded in 2019 &#8212; just a few months before the pandemic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching less than a year ago, Osana says it has secured contracts with health insurance firms and providers that collectively serve more than 6 million patients in the region. For example, it is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> working with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanatorio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Güemes and PAMI, which has a network of 5 million patients, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quiet Capital, Preface Ventures, FJ Labs, AforeVC and K50 Ventures also put money in the latest round, which brings Osana’s total raised over its lifetime to $26.5 million. Lee Fixel’s Addition is also an investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Andre Lawson told TechCrunch he was inspired to start Osana Salud because an estimated 50% of Latin America does not have access to quality healthcare. So he teamed up with COO Jorge Lopez to found the company to help change that. President Charu Sharma (the only staffer who is U.S.-based) and CTO Hugo Martin joined at a later date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our vision is to enable affordable and accessible healthcare for every person in Latin America by leveraging technology,” Lawson said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Osana Salud is building an API-connected infrastructure to help the region’s healthcare industry offer a patient experience that offers “greater convenience, outcomes and value,” Lawson told TechCrunch. Its initial focus is o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n building solutions for telehealth, pharmacy and diagnostics. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, he said, Osana wants to make it faster and cheaper for healthcare players to build solutions that are “safe, secure and interact well” with other health systems. With that in mind, the company has tapped doctors and engineers to design that infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The goal is to empower the next generation of healthcare providers in building patient-centric solutions with the potential to positively impact the healthcare experiences and outcomes for hundreds of millions of people,” Lawson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past eight months, Osana has grown from four to about 50 people, and it expects to have over 250 employees in the next year. Despite not quite being two years old, the startup believes it’s already grown to be Latin America’s biggest telehealth company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma told TechCrunch that despite living in Silicon Valley, she was drawn to the company’s mission and found the potential to “massively transform healthcare for a whole continent&#8221; appealing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the U.S. tech ecosystem, we focus on first-world problems a lot, but an emerging market like LatAm gave me the opportunity to make a meaningful impact at a very basic human need level,” she said. “As the saying goes, talent is equally distributed but opportunity is not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, as evidence that remote work will never be the same after COVID, neither Sharma nor Martin have met Lawson or Lopez in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will in part go toward accelerating the company’s product roadmap, Lawson said, and helping it expand to Brazil and Mexico, where it has seen “strong inbound interest.” But primarily, it will be used for hiring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timing of the company’s inception was good. The pandemic shed light on the fractures of the healthcare system in Latin America, Lawson believes. It also gave the industry the opportunity to show the benefits of a “virtual first” approach, he added. And once people got a taste of it, they wanted more.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where top VCs are investing in healthcare B2B and infrastructure&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-healthcare-b2b-and-infrastructure/embed/#?secret=e60pHJseTy" data-secret="e60pHJseTy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Osana says it has seen a big bump both in the number of clients and in the usage of its technology platform amongst existing ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Furthermore, COVID-19 created urgency for healthcare providers, which resulted in very short sales cycles for us,&#8221; Lawson said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/team/hemant-taneja/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemant Taneja</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of General Catalyst said the startup’s thesis aligns “perfectly” with his firm’s thesis around healthcare. Taneja himself is also a co-founder and executive chairman of San Francisco-based Commure, a venture-backed startup which is also building software infrastructure aimed at transforming the healthcare space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The healthcare infrastructure landscape in Latin America is highly fragmented,” he told TechCrunch. Most software vendors are small or medium-sized local vendors, who have not crossed into other Latin American geographies, Taneja pointed out.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Compound Foods uses synthetic biology to create coffee without coffee beans by extracting molecules.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Maricel Saenz, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2652707267/">Compound Foods</a>, is among the over <a href="https://www.ncausa.org/Newsroom/COVID-19-drives-record-at-home-coffee-drinking-on-the-go-ordering-2021-National-Coffee-Data-Trends-Report">80% of Americans</a> who love a cup of coffee daily. And she also loves the environment.</p>
<p>However, when the Costa Rican-born entrepreneur, now living in the Bay Area, saw how climate change was affecting coffee growers around the world — coffee is the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local">fifth-most polluting crop in the value chain</a> — she wanted to create a coffee product that tasted good, but was also sustainable.</p>
<p>“Temperatures are rising and combined with erratic rains are leading to lower crop yield,” Saenz told TechCrunch. “The same crop can’t grow in the same place anymore, or it will be a lower quality product. Farmers in Costa Rica are having to sell their land or go higher up the mountain. Experts predict that 50% of farmland will be unsuitable in the next couple of decades.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2020, Compound Foods uses synthetic biology to create coffee without coffee beans by extracting molecules. Saenz said the company spent a lot of time examining what makes coffee, well coffee, and then trying to correlate flavors and aromas in certain ways.</p>
<p>And yes, the company can still call it “coffee” even if it doesn’t contain coffee beans because there is no official regulatory definition, she said.</p>
<p>They use food science to recreate a base formula using sustainable ingredients that also don’t use a lot of water — she said it takes 140 liters of water along the coffee growth chain to make one cup of coffee. The company is also working toward a goal of being able to recreate coffee inspired by flavors that you would get from different areas of the world, like Costa Rica, but also the chocolate notes from a cup of Brazilian coffee.</p>
<p>Compound Foods announced $4.5 million in seed funding to give it total funding of $5.3 million to date. Backers of the company include Chris Sacca’s climate fund Lowercarbon Capital, SVLC, Humboldt Fund, Collaborative Fund, Maple VC, Petri Bio and angel investors like Nick Green, CEO of Thrive Market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Saenz intends to use the new funding to improve the formulation and scale up the brand as the company works toward a soft launch by the end of the year.</p>
<p>There are a few competitors in the space doing different technology, including Seattle-based Atomo, which said it makes its coffee from “<a href="https://atomocoffee.com/our-tech">other fruits and plants</a> that had seeds similar to coffee beans.”</p>
<p>Compound Foods is hiring coffee lovers to help build out its technology and to expand its marketing, product and business teams.</p>
<p>Saenz is clear that the company is not competing with coffee.</p>
<p>“We love coffee and know the farmers, and we are providing an alternative solution,” she added. “We want to recreate it, and even drink it on Mars one day, and we want to bring the coffee farmers and the industry with us on the journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ongoing reverberations from the COVID-19 pandemic are continuing to make themselves felt in the most unlikely of places: spaceflight. On Friday, NASA took the unexpected step to <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/kennedy/2021/08/27/nasa-and-united-launch-alliance-review-landsat-9-launch-date/">ground</a> a September satellite launch due to pandemic-related shortages of liquid oxygen (LOX), and there may be more launch delays yet to come.</p>
<p>Demand for oxygen has only risen with the Delta variant, which in many cities pushed hospitalization and ICU admittance rates back to where they were at the start of the pandemic. But oxygen isn’t just used in ventilators. The space industry uses LOX as an oxidizer in rocket propellant, often in combination with other gases like liquid hydrogen. (That’s why there can be so much steam during a launch &#8212; it’s the hydrogen reacting with the oxygen to form water.)</p>
<p>NASA and United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, said the launch date for the Landsat 9 satellite will now take place on September 23.</p>
<p>ULA isn’t the only launch company to potentially be impacted by the LOX shortage. &#8220;We&#8217;re actually going to be impacted this year with the lack of liquid oxygen for launch,&#8221; SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said last week during a panel at the Space Symposium. “We certainly are going to make sure the hospitals are going to have the oxygen that they need, but for anybody who has liquid oxygen to spare, send me an email.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aIH1ZGvk2Q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/lessons-from-covid-flexible-funding-is-a-must-for-alternative-lenders/">Lessons from COVID: Flexible funding is a must for alternative lenders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lessons from COVID: Flexible funding is a must for alternative lenders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/lessons-from-covid-flexible-funding-is-a-must-for-alternative-lenders/embed/#?secret=aIH1ZGvk2Q" data-secret="aIH1ZGvk2Q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, was more tempered a few days later on Twitter, saying that the LOX shortage “is a risk, but not yet a limiting factor.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is a risk, but not yet a limiting factor</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1430778850825355269?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Even beyond the actual supply of oxygen, the gas shortage is also being exacerbated by widespread shipping delays as coronavirus-related disruptions continue to impact the supply chain. ULA CEO Tory Bruno added on Twitter that a contractor who handles nitrogen transportation to Vandenberg Space Force Base in California was diverted to assist with LOX delivery in Florida.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The USG contractor that transports liquid GN2 to VAFB is helping with the COVID related LOX effort in Florida. Working that situation now. <a href="https://t.co/sTyprcRA42">https://t.co/sTyprcRA42</a></p>
<p>— Tory Bruno (@torybruno) <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1430351697403023362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the space industry that’s feeling the effects of the LOX squeeze: Shortly before NASA announced the launch delay, Orlando, Florida officials sent out a separate notice urging residents to conserve water, as LOX is used to treat the city’s water supply.</p>
<p>“Nationally, the demand for liquid oxygen is extremely high as the priority for its use is to save lives, which is limiting the supply that [Orlando municipal water utility] OUC is receiving,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/orlandomayor/posts/10158645715844163">said on Facebook</a>. “There could be impacts to our water quality if we do not immediately reduce the amount of water we need to treat.”</p>
<p>As early as May of last year, the nonprofit Center for Global Development called COVID-19 a <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/Covid-19-and-Oxygen.pdf">“wake-up call”</a> for ensuring an adequate supply of oxygen to hospitals.</p>

<p>Ready to raise? Here&#8217;s just a sample of the fundraising knowledge you can get — you’ll find the specific days and times listed in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Disrupt 2021 agenda</a>.</p>
<h3>How to Raise Your First Dollars</h3>
<p><em>Deciding how to go about getting your initial funding is always a tricky subject, as the wrong move could adversely impact your young company. In this session we’ll hear from Index Ventures’ Nina Achadjian, Sequoia Capital’s Luciana Lixandru and Canvas Ventures’ Rebecca Lynn — experts who’ve shepherded multiple companies from the earliest to the latest fundraises.</em></p>
<h3>How to Ditch Traditional Fundraising</h3>
<p><em>In 2021, venture capital has never been more plentiful, but some founders still can’t break into networks or have found that traditional fundraising isn’t the best route for their business. Fortunately, alternative fundraising techniques are gathering steam as founders find paths to raise cash that diverge from the startup success stories of the past. Join Pipe’s Harry Hurst, Accel’s Arun Mathew and Clearco’s Michele Romanow to learn more about alternative fundraising options.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>You’ve Raised Your Seed Round — Now What? Preparing for Your Series A</h3>
<p><em>You cleared the first hurdle: initial funding is in the bank. You’re hiring more talent, seeing the beginnings of a finished product with clear evidence of traction and experiencing the coveted growth that previously felt just out of reach. Before you know it, the decision to raise for what is arguably the most competitive round is staring you in the face. Join Samsung Next’s David Lee alongside founders Kadie Okwudili (Agapé), Andy Hoang (Aviron) and Jim Bugwadia (Nirmata) as they discuss the learnings and nuances of bridging seed to Series A. Presented by Samsung Next.</em></p>
<h3>Where to Cut and Where to Spend in First-Check Fundraising</h3>
<p><em>Every time a founder raises financing, they usually have one goal: growth. But what does that actually mean? And how do you begin divvying up your new capital between the various goals your startup is barreling toward? In this panel, which includes Harlem Capital’s Henri Pierre-Jacques, Equal Ventures’ Richard Kerby and BBG Ventures’ Nisha Dua, you will learn about how to spend your investment the best way, balancing runway with classic startup rigor.</em></p>
<h3>How Circle’s $4.5B Public Listing Will Change Startup Fundraising</h3>
<p><em>Circle acquired SeedInvest in 2019, as a further step toward realizing its vision of a more open, global, connected and inclusive financial system. Circle recently announced its plans to become a $4.5 billion public company with over $1 billion of fresh capital. In this session, Circle CEO and co-founder Jeremy Allaire and Ryan Feit, CEO and co-founder of SeedInvest, will break down the evolution of the two companies and how Circle and SeedInvest plan to double down on online fundraising to make it faster and easier for entrepreneurs. Presented by by SeedInvest.</em></p>
<h3>Crafting a Pitch Deck that Can’t Be Ignored</h3>
<p><em>Investors may be chasing after the hottest deals, but for founders selling their startup’s vision, it’s never been more important to communicate it in the clearest way possible. Our panelists of pitch deck experts — Lightspeed Venture Partners’ Mercedes Bent, Pear VC’s Mar Hershenson and Techstars’ Saba Karim — dig into what’s essential, what’s unnecessary and what could just make all the difference in your next deck.</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden&#8217;s plan for electric vehicles (EVs) to comprise <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-steps-to-drive-american-leadership-forward-on-clean-cars-and-trucks/">roughly half of U.S. sales by 2030</a> is a clear indication that the U.S. is making strides in decarbonizing its transportation systems, which currently account for nearly half of total U.S. emissions.</p>
<p>Though this kind of federal support is critical in accelerating the mass adoption of EVs, we must face the impending need to rehabilitate the ailing U.S. electric infrastructure that millions currently rely on, namely the capabilities of the power grid.</p>
<p>As society converts to an all-electric future and demand rises for EVs, a challenge our modern world will face is how to charge the increasing number of vehicles without overstressing the grid past its capacity. While <a href="https://www.virta.global/blog/myth-buster-electric-vehicles-will-overload-the-power-grid">some predict</a> EVs will overload the power grid, others have found methods that support our energy infrastructure, including solutions such as wireless charging, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration or more efficient methods of utilizing renewable energy sources, to name a few.</p>
<p>Amid warranted concerns about the unstable grid, there is an urgent need to find solutions that can reinforce this critical infrastructure to avoid pushing the grid to its limits.</p>
<h2>The current challenges facing the grid</h2>
<p>According to the recent <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/">IPCC climate change</a> report, extreme heat waves that previously only struck once every 50 years are now expected to happen once per decade or more frequently due to global warming and anthropogenic emissions. While this has already been seen in this past year through record-breaking heat waves and extreme fires <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/08/09/pacific-northwest-heatwave-fires-california/">in the Pacific Northwest</a>, utilities, operators and industry experts continue to express concern about whether current energy systems will be able to withstand increasing temperatures from climate change.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just heat: In February, a cold snap in Texas crippled energy infrastructure and left millions without power. These numbers will only continue to increase as temperatures rise and the grid overworks itself to meet electricity needs.</p>
<p>In addition to fluctuating temperatures impacting the grid, many are also concerned about its ability to support the increasing number of EVs expected to hit the market in the coming years. With reports indicating that transportation electrification will likely require a <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/72330.pdf">doubling of U.S. generation capacity by 2050</a>, there is a need for flexible EV charging options that can increase flexibility and load times during peak charging hours. However, as it currently stands, the U.S. power grid is only capable of supporting 24 million EVs until 2028 一 well under the required number of EVs needed to successfully curb road transport emissions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite these challenges, one thing that industry experts have pointed out is that EVs have the potential to play a massive role in managing demand as well as aid in stabilizing the grid when necessary. However, as EVs are more widely adopted across the U.S., utilities need to ask themselves critical questions such as when people will likely charge their vehicles, how many users are charging their vehicles and when, what types of chargers are in use, and what types of vehicles are charging (such as passenger vehicles or medium- to heavy-duty fleets) to determine the additional demand for electricity and how they must upgrade their grids.</p>
<h2>EV charging solutions will become an asset, not a liability</h2>
<p>With long lead times for grid infrastructure upgrades paired with an increasing number of individuals and companies looking to electrify their vehicles, municipalities across the U.S. are desperately searching for methods to implement the necessary charging infrastructure to stay ahead of the rising EV tide while simultaneously ensuring the grid’s stability. However, a recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/biden-wants-more-evs-charging-stations/">analysis</a> by the ICCT estimates that with the current number of U.S. EV chargers at 216,000, the country will need 2.4 million public and workplace chargers by 2030 if it wants to meet its goals.</p>
<p>To address this concerning lack of charging infrastructure, cities have begun to explore charging options outside of the traditional, stationary station to not only speed up the adoption of the necessary charging infrastructure, but to protect the grid as well. One of these options is dynamic charging, otherwise known as wireless or in-motion charging.</p>
<p>On one hand, some argue wireless electric vehicle charging will pose an additional strain on existing grid infrastructure by increasing demand variability due to fragmented charging duration caused by charging lane layouts and traffic. On the other hand, many argue that wireless charging actually decreases the demand on the power grid due to the fact that energy demand is spread over time and space throughout the day, rather than being confined to stationary chargers&#8217; charging period between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m., which enables a reduction in required grid connections and upgrades.</p>
<p>Additionally, wireless charging can be deployed in locations where conductive (plug-in) charging solutions cannot &#8212; such as roads, directly under commercial facility loading docks, at exit and entry points to facilities, under taxi queues, at bus stations and terminals, etc., which means that wireless technology can charge EVs at regular intervals throughout the day with “top-up” charging.</p>
<p>This method also enables more efficient utilization of renewable solar energy, produced and utilized predominantly during daylight hours, meaning limited additional energy storage devices are required, unlike conductive EV charging stations, which can typically only be used in the evening and nighttime hours and require energy storage.</p>
<p>These benefits indicate that cities and utilities alike can capitalize on efficient energy utilization strategies such as wireless charging to spread energy demand over time and space &#8212; adding additional flexibility and protection to the grid. While this method can and should be applied to passenger EVs, using it to power medium- to heavy-duty fleet vehicles will allow for a much faster transition to electric in these challenging-to-electrify fleet segments.</p>
<h2>Can wireless charging assist the grid in supporting widespread adoption of EVs?</h2>
<p>While passenger EVs pose challenges of their own to the grid, large-scale fleet charging will be a monumental task if utilities don&#8217;t get ahead of the transition. Wireless charging offers a cost-effective solution to operators looking to transition to meet carbon reduction goals, with projected numbers of electric commercial and passenger fleets <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/charging-electric-vehicle-fleets-how-to-seize-the-emerging-opportunity">making up 10%-15% of all fleet vehicles by 2030</a>. Let’s take a closer look at an example comparison between plugging in large vehicles versus wireless charging and the impact both have on the grid:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conductive (plug-in):</strong> 100 e-buses with 240 kWh batteries using overnight conductive charging at a bus depot requires a minimum grid connection of 6 megawatts (MW) because the entire fleet charges at the end of daily operations, typically simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Inductive (wireless):</strong> 100 e-buses using wireless charging stationary charging technology at bus terminals, garages and stations located inside city centers enable the buses to be “topped-up” throughout the day at natural breaks in their operations. This charging strategy enables both massive battery capacity reduction (the exact amount depends on the fleet and vehicle energy requirements) and, because the bus fleet charging is spread throughout the day, the required grid connection(s) can be reduced by 66% to just 2 MW.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wireless electric roads accompanied by solar panel fences adjacent to the road may be the ultimate solution for decentralizing power generation and eliminating stress on the grid. According to industry calculations, approximately 0.6 miles of this electric fence solution could provide between 1.3-3.3 MW of power. This combination of solar generation coupled with wireless charging infrastructure embedded into the road can support anywhere between 1,300 to 3,300 buses per day independent of power grid supply (assuming an average speed of 50 mph and accounting for seasonal variations in solar radiation).</p>
<p>Furthermore, because wireless electric roads are a shared platform for all EVs, this same road would also charge trucks, vans and passenger vehicles without placing additional pressures on the grid.</p>
<h2>Innovative charging methods will play a critical role in modernizing and adapting our power grid</h2>
<p>Although wireless charging is still relatively new to the market, the benefits are beginning to become glaringly self-evident. Amid increasing concerns about outdated grid infrastructure in the face of widespread transport electrification efforts, rising temperatures and extreme weather conditions, innovative charging methods can provide an optimal solution.</p>
<p>From distributing EV charging throughout the day to avoid overloads to being able to support the energy capacity needs of both passenger vehicles and large fleets simultaneously, technologies such as wireless charging will become critical resources in adapting to an all-electric decarbonized future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-news-feeds-politics-b4a32c93-3dab-42cd-b761-039363ebdb7c.html">preparing to adjust its News Feed</a> to de-emphasize political posts and current events, but news reader Flipboard is instead rolling out an update that puts users in control of their own feeds. The company announced this morning the launch of a new controller on the cover of its own main newsfeed, aka the &#8220;For You&#8221; feed, which now allows users to select new topics to follow and deselect those they no longer want to hear about. The feature, which Flipboard dubs &#8220;an antidote to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/doomsurfing-doomscrolling-words-were-watching">doomscrolling</a>,&#8221; allows users to customize their For You feed to deliver a wider selection of stories related to their various interests, instead of focusing their home page on breaking news and politics.</p>
<p>Given today&#8217;s current events &#8212; a pandemic that&#8217;s dragging on, climate change-induced wildfires and major storms, the fall of Afghanistan and other disasters &#8212; it&#8217;s no wonder why people want to take a break from the daily news. But for Flipboard, that trend could mean reduced use of its news-reading app, as well.</p>
<p>But while Flipboard notes that millions do use its app to keep up with breaking stories and politics, a majority of its user base also spends their time engaging with other topics &#8212; like travel, food, photography, fitness and parenting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196268" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196268" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196268 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flipboard-For-You-personalization-3-screens.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="455" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flipboard-For-You-personalization-3-screens.jpg 2240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flipboard-For-You-personalization-3-screens.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flipboard-For-You-personalization-3-screens.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flipboard-For-You-personalization-3-screens.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flipboard-For-You-personalization-3-screens.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flipboard-For-You-personalization-3-screens.jpg?resize=1536,1029 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flipboard-For-You-personalization-3-screens.jpg?resize=2048,1371 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flipboard-For-You-personalization-3-screens.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196268" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flipboard</p></div></p>
<p>By introducing tools that allow users to customize their own feeds, the company believes users will not only see improved mental health, but will also spend a longer time in the Flipboard app. Already, this appears to be true, based on other recent changes Flipboard has made.</p>
<p>The company recently introduced<a href="https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/tune-your-topics-personalize-any-flipboard-topic-just-for-you/"> topic personalization features</a>, which allowed users to zero in on more niche interests &#8212; think, not just <em>cooking</em> but <em>keto</em> <em>cooking</em>; not just <em>health</em>, but <em>mindfulness</em> and <em>sleep</em>, for example. Users who customized their preferences spent between nine and 12 minutes per day reading stories about these topics, on average, Flipboard found.</p>
<p>With the launch of For You newsfeed controls, Flipboard wants to bring a similar level of customization and control to users&#8217; own homepages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company said the feature also addresses the top request from users &#8212; they&#8217;ve been asking to have more control over the content selection in their For You feed.</p>
<p>To use the feature, you&#8217;ll look for the new filter toggles at the top of the main page. After tapping the icon, you&#8217;ll be launched into a window where you can tap and untap a range of topics. You can also use the search bar to discover other interests that may not be listed. When you&#8217;re finished customizing, you&#8217;ll just tap &#8220;Save&#8221; to exit back to your newly customized For You feed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196270" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196270" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196270 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GIF-Flipboard-For-You-personalization.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196270" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flipboard</p></div></p>
<p>Flipboard hopes its customization capabilities will help it stand out from other news reading experiences &#8212; whether that&#8217;s browsing news inside social media feeds or even in dedicated news reading apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;This level of content control is unique to Flipboard; just think about how hard it is to adjust your feed on any other platform,&#8221; noted Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, when introducing the update. &#8220;A highly personalized feed empowers people to focus on the things that matter to them, without being distracted by doomscrolling, misinformation or browsing through other people’s lives. We build a platform that lets people take control of their media consumption rather than letting it control them,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re in India, the Philippines, Russia or Vietnam, Amazon Prime and Gorillas are probably not that much use to you. Comparable to DoorDash Drive or Lalamove (Malaysia), Dostavista is a “crowdsourced” same-day delivery service. Founded in Russia, the startup initially figured out a way to appeal to gig economy workers in countries such as the ones above by creating a game where players would be asked to deliver virtual items, before pivoting to the real thing. That left-of-field thinking has seen it expand to countries not typically touched by the bigger delivery startups.</p>
<p>Now the Amsterdam HQ-d startup is rebranding as “<a href="http://borzodelivery.com">Borzo</a>” to bring its operation in 10 different countries under one. At the same time, it has raised $35 million in a Series C funding round led by UAE-based investor <a href="http://mubadala.com/">Mubadala</a>. Also participating were VNV Global, RDIF, Flashpoint Venture Capital and others.</p>
<p>The demand for affordable, same-day delivery of goods was obviously accelerated by the pandemic, and no less so in developing countries as well as developed ones.</p>

<p>Borzo says its gig economy workforce enables delivery via any route, any transport, any weight or size. The startup says it has built algorithms to optimize numerous parallel delivery routes, taking into account the geographical routes, packages’ contents, couriers and other factors.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mike Alexandrovski, founder of Borzo, said: “With the new round closed we continue to move toward our goal of becoming one of the top courier delivery companies in every market we operate in. To achieve this goal we believe it’s important to ensure operational synchronicity and integrity of the company&#8217;s brand perception, and that’s why we rebranded it to Borzo.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Borzo says it now has a customer base of 2 million users, 2.5 million couriers and operates in 10 countries, including Brazil, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia, Turkey and Vietnam. It claims to be fulfilling over 3 million orders per month, while its annual gross revenue run rate approaches $150 million, it says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Faris Al Mazrui, head of Russia &amp; CIS at Mubadala, said: “The true fundamental shift in eCommerce took place with the increasing reliability and convenience of on-demand delivery services. In Borzo, we find a team with a clear vision of the opportunity in the evolving on-demand delivery space. They have succeeded in going global; becoming competitive in 10 new international markets.”</p>
