										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thousands of electric vehicle charging stations will be built around the country over the next decade. <a href="https://www.chargerhelp.com/">ChargerHelp!</a>, founded in January 2020 by Kameale C. Terry and Evette Ellis, wants to make sure they stay up and running.</p>
<p>The idea for the on-demand repair app for EV charging stations came to Terry when she was working at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/electric-vehicle-charging-software-ev-connect-raises-12-million/">EV Connect</a>, where she held a number of roles including director of programs and head of customer experience. She noticed long wait times to fix non-electrical issues at charging stations due to the industry practice to use electrical contractors.</p>
<p>“When the stations went down we really couldn’t get anyone on site because most of the issues were communication issues, vandalism, firmware updates or swapping out a part — all things that were not electrical,” Terry said in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After Terry quit her job to start ChargerHelp!, she joined the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, where she developed a first-of-its-kind EV Network Technician Training Curriculum. Shortly after, Terry and Ellis were accepted into Elemental Excelerator’s startup incubator and have landed contracts with major EV charging network providers like EV Connect and SparkCharge.</p>
<p>The company uses a workforce-development approach to hiring, meaning that they only hire in cohorts. Workers receive full training, earn two safety licenses, are guaranteed a wage of $30 an hour and receive shares in the startup, Terry said.</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that Kameale Terry will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=chargerhelpspeaker&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=chargerhelpspeaker&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</strong></a>, a one-day virtual event that is scheduled June 9. We’ll be covering a lot of ground with Terry, from how she developed her EV repair curriculum to what she sees in the company’s future.</p>
<p>Each year TechCrunch brings together founders, investors, CEOs and engineers who are working on all things transportation and mobility. If it moves people and packages from Point A to Point B, we cover it. This year’s agenda is filled with leaders in the mobility space who are shaping the future of transportation, from EV charging to autonomous vehicles to urban air taxis.</p>
<p>Among the growing list of speakers are <strong>Rimac Automobili</strong> founder <strong>Mate Rimac</strong>,  <strong>Revel Transit</strong> CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong><strong>, community organizer,</strong> <strong>transportation </strong>consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>Remix/Via</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong>, who will come together to discuss how (and if) urban mobility can increase equity while still remaining a viable business.</p>
<p>Other guests include <strong>Motional</strong>’s President and CEO <strong>Karl Iagnemma</strong>, <strong>Aurora </strong>co-founder and CEO <strong>Chris Urmson</strong>,<strong> GM</strong>‘s VP of Global Innovation <strong>Pam Fletcher</strong>, <strong>Scale AI</strong> CEO <strong>Alexandr Wang</strong>, <strong>Joby Aviation</strong> founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and<strong> LinkedIn</strong> founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong> (whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby), investors <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of <strong>Urban Innovation Fund</strong>, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of <strong>Autotech Ventures</strong> and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> of <strong>Construct Capital</strong>, <strong>Zoox</strong> co-founder and CTO <strong>Jesse Levinson</strong>.</p>
<p>We also recently announced a panel dedicated to China’s robotaxi industry, featuring three female leaders from Chinese AV startups: <strong>AutoX</strong>’s COO<strong> Jewel Li</strong>, <strong>Huan Sun</strong>, general manager of Momenta Europe with <strong>Momenta</strong>, and <strong>WeRide</strong>’s VP of Finance<strong> Jennifer Li</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t wait to book your tickets to TC Sessions: Mobility as prices go up at the door. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=chargerhelpspeaker&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=chargerhelpspeaker&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grab your passes</a> right now and hear from today’s biggest mobility leaders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>For my American readers, you might be traveling — perhaps for the first time in more than a year — because of the Memorial Day holiday. While Memorial Day is meant to honor members of the U.S. military who died while serving, the three-day weekend has become the unofficial kick off to summer. This year, those traveling by car, truck or SUV will be met by the most expensive Memorial Day weekend gas prices since 2014, according to AAA. The organization also estimates that 37 million Americans will travel by plane and automobile over the holiday — a 60% increase over the same period last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Be safe out on these busy roads, frens.</p>
<p><strong>One story to highlight</strong>: Mark Harris dug into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/the-financial-pickle-facing-elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-system/">contracts for the Las Vegas Loop System</a>. He found that restrictions put in place by Nevada regulators are making it difficult for The Boring Company to meet contractual targets for its LVCC Loop, Elon Musk’s first underground transportation system. Shortly after publication, Steve Hill, president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), tweeted that a Loop test this week, with a few hundred participants, had demonstrated its planned 4,400 passenger per hour capacity, which could release $13 million in construction funds currently being held back. While this bodes well for TBC, the story lays out a number of other issues that could pose a challenge for the company. We will continue to dig into this story of tunnels and transport.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now a request, dear reader. We&#8217;re a bit more than a week away from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>, a one-day virtual event scheduled for June 9 that is bringing together some of the best and brightest minds in transportation, including <strong>Mate Rimac</strong> of Rimac Automobili, <strong>Pam Fletcher</strong> of vp of global innovation at GM, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, Joby Aviation founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and LinkedIn founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong>, whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby, and investors <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of Urban Innovation Fund, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of Autotech Ventures and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> of Construct Capital.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Micromobility rivals <strong>Bird</strong> and <strong>Lime</strong> have come out with news this week that they&#8217;re both marketing as sustainability initiatives. Let&#8217;s start with Bird.</p>
<p>Bird has unveiled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/next-gen-bird-three-scooter-comes-with-bigger-battery-and-better-software/">next-generation scooter,</a> the Bird Three, that it will unveil in New York and Berlin this summer. It&#8217;s got a longer-range battery with 1kWh capacity and an improved diagnostic monitoring system to keep the battery lasting as long as possible. Bird says its better, smarter battery means it&#8217;s ultimately a more sustainable scooter because it has a longer life and needs to be charged a lot less.</p>
<p>Ideally, a better battery and better software will also help produce a longer-lasting vehicle so that Bird can cut down on depreciation and maintenance costs, which have really not helped the company in its push for profitability. Last week, Bird announced a SPAC merger with Switchback II. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">regulatory filings</a> that accompanied the announcement demonstrate just how difficult it is to turn a profit given the unit economics of shared scooters.</p>
<p>Lime is similarly positioning its updated subscription service, Lime Prime, as a sustainable initiative. With each new Prime member sign up, Lime promises to plant a tree through One Tree Planted. But more importantly, the subscription service helps the regular Lime rider perhaps save a bit of money. Members have access to waived unlock fees on any vehicle, and in markets with no start fees, the benefit will be 25% off the ride price. Additionally, riders can get free 30 minute reservations on any vehicle.</p>
<h2>Two-wheel swag news</h2>
<p><strong>Zaiser Motors</strong> announced the launch of its <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/19/2232729/0/en/Electric-motorcycle-manufacturer-Zaiser-Motors-launches-equity-crowdfunding-campaign-on-Wefunder.html">Wefunder campaign</a> to raise funds for development and production of its Electrocycle. It&#8217;s a good-lookin&#8217; vehicle, charcoal-black with a design that breaks away from a super traditional gasoline-era style and looks more like something a small Batman might ride. All of the components are designed to be recyclable within the first 10 years of production, the company says. The Electrocycle has 300 miles of range, swappable batteries and is less than $25,000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in scooter world, the <strong>Scotsman</strong>, a Silicon Valley-based electric scooter brand, has unveiled a scooter that&#8217;s 3D printed entirely in carbon fiber composite. And I don&#8217;t just mean some parts are composite. The whole frame, the handlebars, the stem and the baseboard are all made of this strong, sustainable, lightweight material. It also means the scooters are highly customizable, each frame printed depending on the owner&#8217;s height, weight, arm and leg lengths and riding position. At a starting price of $2,999, it&#8217;s not cheap, but that might be a signal from the industry that scooters are increasingly become viable transport options and not just toys. You can <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scotsman-electric-scooter#/">pre-order here</a>.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>The march of IPOs appears to picking up pace. For instance, <strong>Full Truck Alliance</strong>, the Chinese digital freight platform known as Manbang Group, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1838413/000119312521175480/d260023df1.htm#rom260023_17">filed for an IPO</a>. The filing didn&#8217;t specify the exact amount it was aiming to raise. Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported that the company wants to <a href="https://whbl.com/2021/05/28/chinas-full-truck-alliance-files-for-1-5-billion-u-s-ipo/">raise up to $1.5 billion</a>, which would give it a valuation of $20 billion.</p>
<p>Full Truck Alliance&#8217;s S-1 provides a number of interesting details, including the how much money can be captured by effectively connecting truckers with shippers. The company reported that about 20% of all China&#8217;s heavy-duty and medium-duty truckers fulfilled shipping orders on our platform in 2020. (More than 2.8 million truckers fulfilled shipping orders on its platform last year.) Full Truck Alliance said last year it facilitated 71.7 million fulfilled orders with a gross transaction value of RMB173.8 billion (US$26.6 billion).  The first quarter number show it is growing. In the first quarter, the company had  22.1 million fulfilled orders, a 170.2% increase from the same period.</p>
<p>Full Truck Alliance raised $3.6 billion in private funding, most recently last fall at an $11.7 billion valuation, from firms like SoftBank Vision Fund (22.2% pre-IPO stake), Sequoia Capital China (7.2%), Permira, Tencent, Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners and Baillie Gifford.</p>
<p>The IPO about six months since the company raised $1.7 billion in a funding round that included backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital China, Permira, Fidelity, Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners, Tencent and Jack Ma&#8217;s YF Capital. A look at the S-1 shows that the principal shareholders are Softbank with a 22.2% stake, followed by 8.9% held by Full Load Logistics, a limited liability company owned by Full Truck Alliance CEO Hui Zhang. Sequoia has a 7.2% stake and Master Quality Group Limited, another organization controlled by Zhang, hold 6.6% of shares.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>E2open Parent Holdings Inc.</strong> said it will acquire logistics execution platform BluJay Solution, <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/e2open-to-acquire-blujay-solutions-deal-valued-at-1-7b">Freightwaves reported</a>. The deal could be valued at $1.7 billion, consisting of $760 million in cash and 72.4 million shares.</p>
<p><strong>First Move Capital</strong>, the Boulder-based venture firm that has invested in used car marketplaces Frontier Auto Group and Vroom as well as mobility-as-a-service startup Via, has c<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/fm-capital-steps-up-automotive-investments-with-new-150m-fund/">losed a new $150 million fund</a> that will focus on the automotive and transportation sectors. Proceeds from the round will be exclusively allocated to new investments; seven have already been made, including into autonomous vehicle startup Gatik, cloud-based automotive retail platform Tekion and e-commerce startup Revolution Parts.</p>
<p><strong>Hydra Energy</strong> received CAD$15 million ($12 million) from Just Business to expand beyond pilots and deliver hydrogen-powered trucking, the company announced. This funding is to support the further development of Hydra&#8217;s initial waste hydrogen capture plant in British Columbia, its fueling infrastructure and conversion kits. The Canadian company has raised CAD $22 million (USD $17.2 million) to date. One other update worth sharing, Hydra&#8217;s flagship hydrogen-as-a-service project, is scheduled to break ground later this year.</p>
<p><strong>Miles</strong>, the German car-sharing service has received investment from Delivery Hero CFO Emmanuel Thomassin, HelloFresh CFO Christian Gärtner, Chargepoint CFO Rex Jackson as well as Norwegian top manager Stine Rolstad Brenna. Thomassin has joined the company&#8217;s advisory board. The company disclosed to TechCrunch that it generated 20 million euros ($24.39 million) of revenue in 2020, quadruple the amount from the previous year. The results helped the company achieve profitability in October 2020. Miles is now focused on expansion. In the first four months in 2021, the company launched electric vehicles and expanded its car fleet to Munich. Miles intends to grow beyond Germany and is currently examining the best markets to launch in.</p>
<p><strong>MotoRefi </strong>raised another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/goldman-sachs-leads-45m-investment-into-auto-fintech-startup-motorefi/">$45 million in a round</a> led by Goldman Sachs just five months after investors poured $10 million into the fintech startup to help turbocharge its auto refinancing business. While the company didn&#8217;t give me specifics on its revenue — CEO Kevin Bennett cited a 7x growth year-over-year but didn&#8217;t provide the baseline — it did disclose it&#8217;s on track to issue $1 billion in loans by the end of the year. That&#8217;s a fivefold increase from the same period last year.</p>
<p><strong>Smart Eye</strong>, the publicly traded Swedish company that supplies driver monitoring systems for a dozen automakers, acquired emotion-detection software startup Affectiva for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/emotion-detection-software-startup-affectiva-acquired-for-73-5m/">$73.5 million in a cash-and-stock deal</a>. The startup, which says it developed software that can detect and understand human emotion, spun out of MIT Media Lab in 2009. Since then, it has landed a number of development and proof of concept deals as well as raised capital, but it never quite reached the mass-scale production contracts.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Smart Eye comes in. Smart Eye, which has won 84 production contracts with 13 OEMs, including BMW and GM, is keen to combine with its own AI-based eye-tracking technology. The companies&#8217; founders see an opportunity to expand beyond driver monitoring systems &#8212; tech that is often used in conjunction with advanced driver assistance systems to track and measure awareness &#8212; and into the rest of the vehicle. Together, the technology could help them break into the emerging &#8220;interior sensing&#8221; market, which can be used to monitor the entire cabin of a vehicle and deliver services in response to the occupant&#8217;s emotional state.</p>
<p><strong>Tritium</strong>, a Brisbane-based developer and producer of direct current fast EV chargers, announced a merger agreement with a special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp. II. The deal is expected to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/ev-fast-charger-developer-tritium-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-at-1-2b-valuation/">value the company at $1.2 billion</a>. The transaction is expected to generate gross proceeds of up to $403 million. Tritium will be listed under the ticker &#8220;DCFC.&#8221;</p>
<p>This particular SPAC deal is unusual in that it does not include private investment in public equity, or PIPE &#8212; a fundraising round that typically occurs at the time of the merger and injects more capital into the company. Tritium CEO Jane Hunter told us that the company didn&#8217;t need a PIPE because DCRN is a more than $400 million SPAC and its shareholder group agreed to a minimum cash closing of just $200 million, which significantly reduces redemption risk. &#8220;Also, our revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 56% since 2016 as we expand our presence in major markets where we have a significant market share, such as the U.S. and Europe,&#8221; Hunter said. &#8220;This revenue growth helps to reduce our reliance upon new funds to implement our growth strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Wejo</strong>, the connected vehicle data startup backed by GM and Palantir, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/gm-palantir-backed-wejo-to-go-public-via-spac/">plans to go public</a> through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Virtuoso Acquisition Corp. The agreement, announced in a regulator filing, will give the combined company an enterprise valuation of $800 million, which includes debt. There were earlier reports that the SPAC deal was imminent. The filing confirms the news and provides more detail.</p>
<p>The deal raises $330 million in proceeds for Wejo, including a $230 million cash contribution from Virtuoso and a $100 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. Previous strategic investors Palantir and GM anchored the transaction, according to Wejo. The company did not disclose the amounts of those investments. Current shareholders will retain 64% ownership of the company, according to its investor deck.</p>

<p>Senate Republicans released their response to Joe Biden&#8217;s sweeping $2 trillion investment plan, which would earmark $174 billion for electric vehicle investments. Their proposal would shrink it down to $928 billion. And that $174B for EVs? That would be reduced to just $4 billion, under the GOP plan.</p>
<p>It seems that the main point of contention between the President and his GOP colleagues is the definition of the word &#8216;infrastructure.&#8217; Republicans are sticking to a more traditional definition, so their counterproposal still contains plenty of money for things like roads, the water system, bridges and broadband.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s plan aimed to provide consumer tax incentives and incentives for EV chargers, incentives to boost domestic manufacturing and enough funds to install at least 500,000 public charging stations across the country by 2030. A memo obtained by <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/554820-biden-holds-firm-on-climate-provisions-in-infrastructure">The Hill</a> suggests Biden intends to hold firm to his proposal, so expect further negotiations in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The Senate Finance Committee on May 26 marked up the <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Clean%20Energy%20for%20America%20Act.pdf">Clean Energy for America Act</a>, an important step before it hits the Senate floor for a vote. Among other things, the bill would remove 200,000 unit cap on tax credits for consumers buying EVs &#8212; that means the tax credit could be used toward buying a Tesla, a manufacturer that hasn&#8217;t been eligible for the credit because they&#8217;ve sold over 200,000 cars in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Debbie Stabenow</strong> (D-MI) added an amendment to the bill that would create an additional $2,500 consumer credit for vehicles assembled in the U.S. and another $2,500 for vehicles assembled in a unionized facility. If it passes, the additions would bring the maximum consumer tax credit for EVs to $12,500 &#8212; no small sum! The credits would expire in 2025. &#8220;Electric vehicles are part of our transportation future,&#8221; Sen. Stabenow said. &#8220;The question is not when they will be built, it&#8217;s where they will be built: in Asia or America?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm</strong> sold her holdings in electric bus manufacturer Proterra after Republicans criticized her for a potential conflict of interest. The GOP&#8217;s complaint arose after Biden made a virtual visit to a Proterra factory in April. The sale provided Granholm with a net gain of $1.6 million, DOE told reporters.</p>

<h2>A little bird</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896211 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif" alt="blinky cat bird green" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I hear and see things, but we&#8217;re not selfish. Let me share.</p>
<p>This week, &#8220;a little bird&#8221; is all about big employment moves and departures and how one hire is connected to a potentially massive IPO.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s kick things off with <strong>Celina Mikolajczak</strong>, the now <em>former</em> vice president of battery technology at <strong>Panasonic Energy of North America</strong>. You might recall that Mikolajczak recently took a board seat at solid state battery company <strong>QuantumScape</strong>. Welp, she is now taking a job at the company as vice president of manufacturing engineering, beginning in July. She has resigned from the board in connection with accepting the offer. In her new role, Ms. Mikolajczak will lead the transition of the Company&#8217;s tools and manufacturing processes from research and development to production, <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-170075/">QuantumScape said in a regularly filing</a>.</p>
<p>Mikolajczak has a long history researching and developing better lithium-ion batteries. Her technical consulting practice at Exponent focused on lithium-ion cell and battery safety and quality. She then took a senior management position at <strong>Tesla</strong> that was focused on cell quality and materials engineering. During her time at Tesla, Mikolajczak developed the battery cells and packs for Tesla&#8217;s Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Roadster Refresh.</p>
<p>After leaving Tesla, Mikolajczak went on to serve as director of engineering focused on battery development for rideshare vehicles at Uber Technologies. And in 2019, she joined Panasonic Energy of North America, where she is vice president of battery technology. While at Panasonic, Mikolajczak led a team of more than 200 engineers and other technical staff to improve lithium-ion cell manufacturing and to bring the latest cell technologies to mass production for Tesla at the Gigafactory facility in Sparks, Nevada.</p>
<p>Speaking of <strong>Tesla</strong> &#8230; it looks like <strong>Scott Sims</strong>, director of engineering, left the company this month. His title doesn&#8217;t quite capture his role. Sims was the person leading the design and engineering for vehicle user interfaces, streaming, video games and mobile applications. Importantly, he was responsible for cloud computing as it related to the Tesla mobile app, a critical tool for any owner.</p>
<p>Finally, the big news on Friday (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/electric-truck-maker-rivian-is-said-to-select-ipo-underwriters">via Bloomberg</a>) is that <strong>Rivian</strong> has selected underwriters for an initial public offering. The company could seek an eye-popping value of $70 billion. I have confirmed some (but not all) of Bloomberg&#8217;s reporting. Obviously big news that I&#8217;ll be watching and digging into. I had heard rumbling about a potential Rivian IPO, but Bloomberg put together the critical deets.</p>
<p>To me, the biggest indication that Rivian was getting ready to make a move was <strong>Ger Dwyer</strong> taking the vp of business finance position at the company, which he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gerard-dwyer-5819832_the-next-chapter-this-is-my-first-week-activity-6803492501547307008-REU4/">posted about on LinkedIn</a>. You might recall, that I scooped the news a couple of weeks ago that Dwyer was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/waymos-cfo-and-head-of-automotive-partnerships-are-leaving-the-autonomous-vehicle-company/">leaving his post as CFO at <strong>Waymo</strong></a>. I noted at the time that Dwyer&#8217;s departure comes at a time when the demand for CFOs has rocketed alongside the continuous string of public offerings, including those done via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies.</p>

<p>Loads and loads of news. Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/developing-the-aurora-driver-to-move-millions-of-goods">published a blog post</a> that gives a few new details on its testing and self-driving trucks strategy in Texas. The autonomous vehicle company said its first commercial pilots will move goods on several &#8220;middle-mile&#8221; routes in Texas. A safety driver will be behind the wheel of these self-driving trucks, which will drive autonomously between hubs. The terminal or hub system is one that other AV companies have adopted — at least for now. The idea is that loads can be consolidated, which would theoretically make operations more efficient. Aurora did add, that &#8220;for shippers and carriers with existing hubs and large volumes of freight, we expect to ultimately drive the complete route with no need for an intermediate consolidation point.&#8221;</p>
<p>One other item that jumped out to me: the company is expanding into a second office in Texas, suggesting that they&#8217;re scaling up, at least in terms of people.</p>
<p><strong>Germany&#8217;s</strong> lower house of parliament <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/germany-gives-greenlight-to-driverless-vehicles-on-public-roads/">adopted legislation</a> that will allow driverless vehicles on public roads by 2022, laying out a path for companies to deploy robotaxis and delivery services in the country at scale. While autonomous testing is currently permitted in Germany, this would allow operations of driverless vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The bill still needs to pass through the upper chamber of parliament, or the Bundesrat. Included in the bill are possible initial applications for self-driving cars on German roads, such as public passenger transport, business and supply trips, logistics, company shuttles that handle employee traffic and trips between medical centers and retirement homes.</span></p>
<p><strong>PAVE</strong>, which stands for Partners for Autonomous Vehicle Education, piloted a workshop with local governments earlier this month throughout Ohio. The educational workshop, which was done in partnership with Drive Ohio, wasn&#8217;t open to the public. But my Autonocast podcast co-host Ed Niedermeyer, who also happens to be director of communications for PAVE, gave me the inside scoop on what went down.</p>
<p>PAVE says it doesn&#8217;t do any kind of policy advocacy; instead the aim is to arm public policymakers with the facts they need to make good policy. This pilot helped PAVE lay a foundation for a curriculum that can be used elsewhere; that might seem trivial, but the complexity of issues around AVs makes these workshops with elected officials potentially powerful tool.</p>
<p>Ed told me that one of the main challenges was educating on potentially controversial topics, like policy and regulation, &#8220;where we have to get facts across without imparting biases.&#8221; He noted that the organization&#8217;s public sector and academic advisory councils were both helpful as neutral authorities. Finally, he said that one of the most practical education PAVE did was around the best practices that its members and advisors have developed in early AV deployments.</p>
<p><strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, the U.S.-based self-driving truck startup, is partnering with South Korean conglomerate SK Inc. to explore the possibility of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-partnering-with-sk-group-to-expand-into-asia/">deploying its autonomous vehicle technology</a> in Asia. While Kodiak co-founder and CEO Don Burnette couched the initial agreement as a first step toward a commercial enterprise in Asia, the reach of SK shouldn&#8217;t be discounted. SK Inc., a holding company of SK Group, has more than 120 operating companies, including ones connected to the logistics industry.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of the partnership is to sell and distribute Kodiak&#8217;s self-driving technology in the region. Kodiak will examine how it can use SK&#8217;s products, components and technology for its autonomous system, including artificial intelligence microprocessors and advanced emergency braking systems. Both companies have also agreed to work together to provide fleet management services for customers in Asia.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong>, fresh off its splashy F-150 Lightning electric truck reveal, announced it is pushing its investment in EVs up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">$30 billion by 2025</a>, up from a previous spend of $22 billion by 2023. The company announced the fresh cashflow into its EV and battery development strategy, dubbed Ford+, during its investor day.</p>
<p>The company said it expects 40% of its global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030. Ford sold 6,614 Mustang Mach-Es in the U.S. in Q1, and since it unveiled its F-150 Lightning last week, the company says it has already amassed 70,000 customer reservations.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai</strong> held the North American reveal of the upcoming all-electric Ioniq 5 crossover. One new detail that I found interesting: Hyundai developed an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/hyundai-is-launching-in-car-payments-in-the-all-electric-ioniq-5/">in-car payment system</a> that will debut in the Ioniq 5. The feature will offer drivers the ability to find and pay for EV charging, food and parking. When the vehicle comes to North America in fall 2021, the payments system will launch with Dominoes, ParkWhiz and Chargehub.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors&#8217;</strong> cash-rich SPAC dreams have turned out to be nothin&#8217; more than wishes, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">Alex Wilhelm and Aria Alamalhodaei reported</a>. The upshot: a disappointing first-quarter earnings that was a pile-up of red-ink-stained negativity. The lowlights include higher-than-expected forecasted expenses, a need to raise more capital and lower-than-anticipated production of its Endurance vehicle this year &#8212; from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000. In short, the company is set to consume more cash than the street expected and is further from mass production of its first vehicle than promised.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Motors</strong> revealed the in-cabin tech of its upcoming electric luxury Air sedan. I spoke to Derek Jenkins, who heads up design at Lucid, and he provided a detailed tour of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/lucid-motors-reveals-all-the-tech-inside-its-all-electric-air-sedan/">all the tech in the vehicle</a>. It goes far beyond the curved 34-inch display and second touchscreen, which received much of the attention. The user experience, particularly the underlying software, matters in all cars. But it can be the death of an electric vehicle model if not done properly.</p>
<p>It appears Lucid is on the right track. I won&#8217;t really know until I&#8217;m able to test the Air. Let&#8217;s hope that is soon.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong> has delayed deliveries of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/rivian-delays-deliveries-of-the-r1t-launch-edition-by-one-month/">R1T Launch Edition</a>, the limited edition release of its first series of &#8220;electric adventure vehicles,&#8221; by a month. Customers who preordered can now expect to start receiving their pickup trucks in July instead of June, with Launch Edition deliveries to be completed by spring 2022. The one-month delay was due to a combination of small issues, including delays on shipping containers, the ongoing chip shortage as well as ensuring the servicing piece is properly set up. It&#8217;s worth noting that Rivian told me that it has been largely unaffected by the chip shortage compared to the rest of the industry because its products don&#8217;t require as many as other vehicles on the market today.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> had a number of news items this week, so I&#8217;ll just point to the most notable ones. Tesla has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/tesla-china-user-data-storage/">established a data center</a> in China to carry out the &#8220;localization of data storage,&#8221; with plans to add more data facilities in the future, the company announced through its account on microblogging platform Weibo. All data generated by Tesla vehicles sold in mainland China will be kept domestically. The move was in response to new requirements drafted by the Chinese government to regulate how cameras- and sensors-enabled carmakers collect and utilize data. One of the requirements states that &#8220;personal or important data should be stored within the [Chinese] territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, two safety-related pieces of Tesla news that seem in opposition to each other.</p>
<p>First, Tesla started delivering Model 3 and Model Y vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/tesla-is-no-longer-using-radar-sensors-in-model-3-and-model-y-vehicles-built-in-north-america/">without radar</a>, fulfilling a vision of CEO Elon Musk to only use cameras combined with machine learning to support its advanced driver assistance system and other active safety features. The decision has prompted blowback though from the National Traffic Highway and Safety Administration, Consumer Reports and IIHS over safety concerns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tesla finally — and after loud and frequent urging from industry and safety advocates, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/tesla-has-activated-its-in-car-camera-to-monitor-drivers-using-autopilot/">activated the in-cabin camera</a> in new Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. The camera will be used as a driver monitoring system. Tesla has been criticized for not activating the driver monitoring system within its vehicles even as evidence mounted that owners were misusing the system. Owners have posted dozens of videos on YouTube and TikTok abusing its advanced driver assistance system known as Autopilot &#8212; some of whom have filmed themselves sitting in the backseat as the vehicle drives along the highway.</p>
<h3>Other nugs (no not that kind)</h3>
<p><strong> Apex.AI</strong> hired Paul Balciunas as its CFO. Balciunas was the former CFO of Canoo. He also was an executive at Deutsche Bank, where he acted as a lead underwriter of the initial public offering for Tesla in 2010, and has since focused on auto tech and new mobility players.</p>
<p><strong>Blyncsy</strong>, a Utah-based startup movement and data intelligence company launched an AI-powered technology called Payver, that will use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/utah-dot-pilots-blyncsys-ai-powered-road-maintenance-technology/">crowdsourced video data</a> to give transport agencies up-to-date information on which roads require maintenance and improvements. Blyncsy is offering this service to governments at a reduced cost and with no long-term commitment. Utah&#8217;s DOT will be the first to pilot the program beginning June 1, deploying Payver in the Salt Lake County region, which covers more than 350 road miles. Blyncsy will be announcing other pilots in different states over the next few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Scale AI</strong> hired Mark Valentine to head up its federal-focused division. Valentine comes with experience and connections. He was  a commander in the U.S. Air Force, senior military advisor to FEMA and most recently, GM of national security for Microsoft. He will lead Scale&#8217;s government partnership efforts.</p>
<p>Scale has also hired Michael Kratsios, the former CTO of the White House, as managing director and head of strategy. The company said he is focused on accelerating the development of AI across industries. Michael joined at the end of Q1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://june.so">June</a>, a new startup that wants to make it easier to create analytics dashboards and generate reports even if you’re not a product analytics expert. June is built on top of your <a href="https://segment.com">Segment</a> data. Like many no-code startups, it uses templates and a graphical interface so that non-technical profiles can start using it.</p>
<p>“What we do today is instant analytics and that’s why we’re building it on top of Segment,” co-founder and CEO Enzo Avigo told me. “It lets you access data much more quickly.”</p>
<p>Segment acts as the data collection and data repository for your analytics. After that, you can start playing with your data in June. Eventually, June plans to diversify its data sources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our long-term vision is to become the Airtable of analytics,” Avigo said.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a>, June may look familiar. The company has built a template library to help you get started. For instance, June helps you track user retention, active users, your acquisition funnel, engagement, feature usage, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159290" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159290" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png" alt="" width="1024" height="583" class="size-full wp-image-2159290" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=2048,1165 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-Templates.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159290" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> June</p></div></p>
<p>Once you pick a template, you can start building a report by matching data sources with templates. June automatically generates charts, sorts your user base into cohorts and shows you important metrics. You can create goals so that you receive alerts in Slack whenever something good or bad is happening.</p>
<p>Advanced users can also use June so that everyone in the team is using the same tool. They can create custom SQL queries and build a template based on those queries.</p>
<p>The company raised a seed round of $1.85 million led by Point Nine. Y Combinator, Speedinvest, Kima Ventures, eFounders and Base Case also participated, as well as several business angels.</p>
<p>Prior to June, the startup’s two co-founders worked for Intercom. They noticed that the analytics tool was too hard to use for many people. They didn’t rely on analytics to make educated decisions.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of companies using June every week and that number is growing by 10% per week. Right now, the product is free but the company plans to charge based on usage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is already underway on building its first floating spaceport platform, and the plan is for it to start hosting launches as early as next year. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk shared those details on the progress of its build for Deimos, one of two converted oil rigs that SpaceX purchased earlier this year in order to transform them into floating launch and landing sites for its forthcoming Starship reusable rocket.</p>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s purchase of the two rigs at the beginning of this year was for the creation of Deimos and Phobos, two floating spaceports named after the moons of Mars. They&#8217;ll act as offshore staging grounds for Starship launch activities, and the name is appropriate because the eventual plan is to have Starship provide transport for both people and goods to and from the red planet.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ocean spaceport Deimos is under construction for launch next year <a href="https://t.co/WJQka399c7">https://t.co/WJQka399c7</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1399088815705399305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Musk and SpaceX have previously shared their vision for a future in which spaceports like Deimos are positioned within convenient reach of major hubs around the world, making it possible for SpaceX to operate a globe-spanning network of hypersonic point-to-point travel using Starships ferrying people from destinations as far flung as Beijing to New York in around 30 minutes. Before that, however, SpaceX will be looking to conduct orbital flight testing of the still in-development Starship, and its accompany booster, the Super Heavy.</p>
<p>Musk said earlier this year that it could b<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/spacexs-floating-oil-rig-spaceship-launch-pad-could-be-operating-later-this-year-according-to-elon-musk/">egin flying rockets from its offshore platforms as early as the end of 2021</a>. This new timeline indicates that rosy estimate has been pushed, which is pretty standard for the multi-CEO. The company has recently made good progress in its Starship program, however, with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/spacex-successfully-launches-and-lands-its-starship-prototype-rocket/">successful high-altitude launch and landing test</a> at its Texas &#8216;Starbase&#8217; development site.</p>
<p>SpaceX is now in the process of getting ready for its first orbital flight test, which will include flying Starship atop Super Heavy for the first time, and a recovery of the Starship following the test after it splashes down off the coast of Hawaii. It&#8217;s now doing longer fire Raptor engine ground tests to get ready for that next big milestone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hundreds of thousands of Chinese students enrolled in overseas schools are stranded as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt life and airlines worldwide. Learning at home in China, they all face one challenge: Their school websites and other academic resources load excruciatingly slowly because all web traffic has to pass through the country&#8217;s censorship apparatus known as the &#8220;great firewall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotting a business opportunity, Alibaba&#8217;s cloud unit worked on connecting students in China to their university portals abroad through a virtual private network <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/partner/fortinet">arrangement</a> with American cybersecurity solutions provider Fortinet to provide, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibaba-cloud-vpn-idUSKCN24O356">reported</a> last July, saying Tencent had a similar product.</p>
<p>Details of Tencent&#8217;s offering have come to light. An app called &#8220;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%E9%95%BF%E9%B9%85%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E5%8A%A0%E9%80%9F-%E8%85%BE%E8%AE%AF%E6%B5%B7%E5%A4%96%E5%AD%A6%E6%9C%AF%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%E5%8A%A0%E9%80%9F%E5%99%A8/id1548408161">Chang&#8217;e Education Acceleration</a>&#8221; debuted on Apple&#8217;s App Store in March, helping to speed up loading time for a selection of overseas educational services. It describes itself in a mouthful: &#8220;An online learning free accelerator from Tencent, with a mission to provide internet acceleration and search services in educational resources to students and researchers at home and abroad.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike Alibaba&#8217;s VPN for academic use, Chang&#8217;e is not a VPN, the firm told TechCrunch. The firm didn&#8217;t say how it defines VPN or explain how Chang&#8217;e works technically. Tencent said Chang&#8217;e rolled out on the app&#8217;s official website in October.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;VPN&#8221; is a loaded term in China as it often implies illegally bypassing the &#8220;great firewall.&#8221; People refer to its euphemism &#8220;accelerator&#8221; or &#8220;scientific internet surfing tool&#8221; otherwise. When Chang&#8217;e is switched on, iPhone&#8217;s VPN status is shown as &#8220;on&#8221;, according to a test by TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159263" style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159263" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2159263" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="604" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46811622438852_.pic_-1.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159263" class="wp-caption-text">Tencent&#8217;s Chang&#8217;e website &#8216;accelerator&#8217; helps Chinese students stuck home get on their school websites faster. Screenshot: TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>On the welcome page, Chang&#8217;e asks users to pick from eight countries, including the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., for &#8220;acceleration&#8221;. It also shows the latency time and expected speed increased for each region.</p>
<p>Once a country is picked, Chang&#8217;e shows a list of educational resources that users can visit on the app&#8217;s built-in browser. They include the websites of 79 top universities, mostly U.S. and the U.K. ones; team collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams, Trello and Slack; remote-learning platforms UDemy, Coursera, Lynda and Khan Academy; research networks such as SSRN and JSTOR; programming and engineering communities like Stack Overflow, Codeacademy and IEEE; economics databases from the World Bank and OECD; as well as resources for medical students like PubMed and Lancet.</p>
<p>Many of these services are not blocked in China but load slowly on mainland China behind the &#8220;great firewall.&#8221; Users can request sites not already on the list to be included.</p>

Screenshot: TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Chang&#8217;e appears to have whitelisted only its chosen sites rather than all traffic on a user&#8217;s smartphone. Google, Facebook, YouTube and other websites banned in China are still unavailable when the Chang&#8217;e is at work. The app, available on both Android and iOS for free, doesn&#8217;t currently require users to sign up, a rare gesture in a country where online activities are strictly regulated and most websites ask for users&#8217; real-name registrations.</p>

<p>The offerings from Alibaba and Tencent are indicative of the inadvertent consequences caused by Beijing&#8217;s censorship system designed to block information deemed illegal or harmful to China&#8217;s national interest. Universities, research institutes, multinational corporations and exporters are often forced to seek censorship circumvention apps for what the authorities would consider innocuous purposes.</p>
<p>VPN providers have to obtain the government&#8217;s green light to legally operate in China and users of licensed VPN services are <a href="http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/content/2011/content_1860856.htm">prohibited from</a> browsing websites thought of us endangering China&#8217;s national security. In 2017, Apple removed hundreds of unlicensed VPN apps from its China App Store at Beijing&#8217;s behest.</p>
<p>In October, TechCrunch reported that the VPN app and browser <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/new-chinese-browser-lets-users-get-around-great-firewall/">Tuber gave Chinese users a rare glimpse</a> into the global internet ecosystem of Facebook, YouTube, Google and other mainstream apps, but the app was removed shortly after the article was published.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more than 400 million Arabic speakers globally and that number isn&#8217;t slowing down anytime soon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Arabic, to most people, is a tough language even to those who speak it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/what-makes-arabic-hard-and-why-that-shouldnt-stop-you-from-learning-it/">Duolingo</a>, someone fluent in Egyptian Arabic might not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> understand Yemeni Arabic speakers because of the vast difference in dialect</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While individuals can easily navigate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dialects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it can be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hard for them to find tailored Arabic content essential for everyday life</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.almentor.net/en/mentor/Ihab-Fikry">Dr Ihab Fikry</a> and <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-mostafa-kamel">Ibrahim Kamel</a> founded <a href="https://www.almentor.net/en/home">Almentor.net</a> in 2016 as an online video learning platform to compensate for this lack of online learning content for Arabic speakers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In collaboration with hundreds of leaders, educators, and experts, the platform offers courses and talks in various fields like health, humanities, technology, entrepreneurship, business management, lifestyle, drama, sports, corporate communication, and digital media</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Almentor closed a $3.5 million seed round and two years ago raised $4.5 million Series A led by Egypt&#8217;s Sawari Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this Series B investment, the Dubai-based edtech company has raised $14.5 million in total. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco and Paris-based VC firm Partech led the financing round with participation from Sawari Ventures, fellow Series A investor Egypt Ventures, and Sango Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almentor provides Arab learners with the necessary skills </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">crucially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed to advance their professional careers and personal lives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform claims to have the biggest continuous learning library in the region and one of the biggest worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With offices in Dubai, Cairo, and Saudi Arabia, its video content </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is developed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in-house and made in Arabic and English</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The vision and reason behind starting Almentor is we understand that in our region of more than 100 million people, of which 90% cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">properly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> learn with any other language other than Arabic,&#8221; Fikry said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So we wanted to have a cutting-edge state of the art platform that will change people&#8217;s ideology and help them be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">objective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and focus based on topics that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be taught</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as prodigious learning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For first-time products like Almentor, it can be hard to get both investors and customers on board</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO Fikry, the first challenge was to convince the investment community in the MENA region that Almentor was creating a new industry in video e-learning that &#8220;had lots of potential to power tools in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almentor&#8217;s business is an intersection of education, media, and technology. Its offerings </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are dissected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into three: the flagship B2C product, a white-label B2B model for blue-chip companies, and the last, which Fikry calls the &#8216;special project&#8217; for governmental bodies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its B2C product, Almentor sells courses to users for $20-$30 of which they get to keep for a lifetime. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fikry says that in June, the company is planning to introduce a subscription-based model where users can have unlimited access to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its 12,000 video content for a fee to its more than 1 million registered users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2159243 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?w=680" alt="Almentor" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png 1201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-149.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B model is where Almentor opens its library to companies to customize their content for employees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These videos are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tutorials or training needed to thrive at work, and since 2016, Almentor has executed 78 deals with partner companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special project&#8217;s model highlights Almentor&#8217;s work with the government. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One time, the company had a partnership with the Egyptian government to upskill the country&#8217;s movie industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has completed 11 more similar special projects since launching five years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across all three models, Fikry says Almentor has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delivered more than 2 million learning experiences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company wants to improve content production and quality and educate people in the MENA region on why they need the product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are now leading the continuous video learning industry in the Arab region, and we have a responsibility that goes beyond our ambitions for Almentor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our responsibility now is to work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unceasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve the industry as a whole in the Arab region, and this can only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be achieved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through gaining the confidence of the Arab learners in the value, professionalism and impartiality of the content provided by the platform and working in line with the global learning trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment for Partech, general partner Cyril Collon said: “Since our first interaction, we have been very impressed by Ihab and Ibrahim, two fantastic mission-driven entrepreneurs who have been executing on a bold vision since 2016, and who built the leading Arabic self-learning go-to content provider in the Middle East and Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We are looking forward to supporting the company in its next phase of growth to serve the 430 million Arabic-speaking population and expand access to on-demand cutting-edge personal learning &amp; developments options</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cloud kitchens are already meant to reduce the burden of infrastructure on food and beverage brands by providing them with centralized facilities to prepare meals for delivery. This means the responsibility falls on cloud kitchen operators to make sure they have enough locations to meet demand from F&amp;B clients, while ensuring fast deliveries to end customers.</p>
<p>Indonesian network <a href="https://dishserve.com/">DishServe</a> has figured out a way to make running cloud kitchen networks even more asset-light. Launched by budget hotel startup RedDoorz’s former chief operating officer, DishServe partners with home kitchens instead of renting or buying its own facilities. It currently works with almost 100 home kitchens in Jakarta, and focuses on small- to medium-sized F&amp;B brands, serving as their last-mile delivery network. Launched in fall 2020, DishServe has raised an undisclosed amount of pre-seed funding from Insignia Ventures Partners.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;RedDoorz raises $70M to expand its budget hotel network in Southeast Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/18/reddoorz-seriesc/embed/#?secret=SYe1N1vmW2" data-secret="SYe1N1vmW2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>DishServe was founded in September 2020 by Rishabh Singhi. After leaving RedDoorz at the end of 2019, Singhi moved to New York, with plans to launch a new hospitality startup that could quickly convert any commercial space into members’ clubs like Soho House. The nascent company had already created sample pre-fabricated rooms and was about to start leasing property when the COVID-19 lockdown hit New York City in March 2020. Singhi said he went on a “soul searching spree” for a couple of months, deciding what to do and if he should return to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>He realized that since many restaurants had to switch to online orders and delivery to survive the pandemic, this could potentially be an equalizer for small F&amp;B brands that compete with larger players, like McDonald’s. But lockdowns meant that a lot of people had to pick from a limited range of restaurants close to where they lived. At the same time, Singhi saw that there were a lot of people who wanted to make more money, but couldn’t work outside of their homes, like stay-at-home moms.</p>
<p>DishServe was created to connect all three sides: F&amp;B brands that want to expand without spending a lot of money, home entrepreneurs and diners hungry for more food options. Its other founders include Stefanie Irma, an early RedDoorz employee who served as its country head for the Philippines; serial entrepreneur Vinav Bhanawat; and Fathhi Mohamed, who also co-founded Sri Lankan on-demand taxi service PickMe.</p>
<p>The company works with F&amp;B brands that typically have between just one to 15 retail locations, and want to increase their deliveries without opening new outlets. DishServe’s clients also include cloud kitchen companies who use its home kitchen network for last-mile distribution to expand their delivery coverage and catering services.</p>
<p>“The brands don’t to have to incur any upfront costs, and it’s a cheaper way to distribute as well because they don’t have to pay for electricity, plumbing and other things like that,” said Singhi. “And for agents, it gives them a chance to earn money from their homes.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hangry, an Indonesian cloud kitchen startup with plans to become a global F&#038;B company, closes $13M Series A&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/hangry-an-indonesian-cloud-kitchen-startup-with-plans-to-become-a-global-fb-company-closes-13m-series-a/embed/#?secret=88i440K97S" data-secret="88i440K97S" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Before adding a home kitchen to its network, DishServe screens applicants by asking them to send in a series of photos, then doing an in-person check. If a kitchen is accepted, DishServe upgrades it so it has the same equipment and functionality as the other home kitchens in its network. The company covers the cost of the conversion process, which usually takes about three hours and costs $500 USD, and maintains ownership of the equipment, taking it back if a kitchen decided to stop working with DishServe. Singhi said DishServe is usually able to recover the cost of a conversion four months after a kitchen begins operating.</p>
<p>Home kitchens start out by serving DishServe’s own white-label brand as a trial run before it opens to other brands. Each can serve up to three additional brands at a time.</p>
<p>One important thing to note is that DishServe’s home kitchens, which are usually run by one person, don’t actually cook any food. Ingredients are provided by F&amp;B brands, and home kitchen operators follow a standard set of procedures to heat, assemble and package meals for pick-up and delivery.</p>

<p>DishServe makes sure standard operating procedures and hygiene standards are being maintained through frequent online audits. Agents, or kitchen operators, regularly submit photos and videos of kitchens based on a checklist (i.e. food preparation area, floors, walls, hand-washing area and the inside of their freezers). Singhi said about 90% of its agents are women between the ages of 30 to 55, with an average household income of $1,000. By working with DishServe, they typically make an additional $600 a month once their kitchen is operating at full capacity with four brands. DishServe monetizes through a revenue-sharing model, charging F&amp;B brands and splitting that with its agents.</p>
<p>After joining DishServe, F&amp;B brands pick what home kitchens they want to work with, and then distribute ingredients to kitchens, using DishServe’s real-time dashboard to monitor stock. Some ingredients have a shelf life of up to six months, while perishables, like produce, dairy and eggs, are delivered daily. DishServe’s “starter pack” for onboarding new brands lets them pick pick five kitchens, but Singhi said most brands usually begin with between 10 to 20 kitchens so they can deliver to more spots in Jakarta and save money by preparing meals in bulk.</p>
<p>DishServe plans to focus on growing its network in Jakarta until at least the end of this year, before expanding into other cities. “One thing we are trying to change about the F&amp;B industry is that instead of highly-concentrated, centralized food business, like what exists today, we are decentralizing it by enabling micro-entrepreneurs to act as a distribution network,” Singhi said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cookie pop-ups getting you down? Complaints that the web is &#8216;unusable&#8217; in Europe because of frustrating and confusing &#8216;data choices&#8217; notifications that get in the way of what you&#8217;re trying to do online certainly aren&#8217;t hard to find.</p>
<p>What is hard to find is the &#8216;reject all&#8217; button that lets you opt out of non-essential cookies which power unpopular stuff like creepy ads. Yet the law says there should be an opt-out clearly offered. So people who complain that EU &#8216;regulatory bureaucracy&#8217; is the problem are taking aim at the wrong target.</p>
<p>EU law on cookie consent is clear: Web users should be offered a simple, free choice &#8212; to accept or reject.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem is that most websites simply aren&#8217;t compliant. They choose to make a mockery of the law by <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">offering a skewed choice: Typically a super simple opt-<em>in</em> (to hand them all your data) vs a highly confusing, frustrating, tedious opt-out (and sometimes even <em>no reject option at all</em>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Make no mistake: This is ignoring the law by design. Sites are choosing to try to wear people down so they can keep grabbing their data by only offering the most cynically asymmetrical &#8216;choice&#8217; possible. </span></p>
<p>However since that&#8217;s not how cookie consent is supposed to work under EU law sites that are doing this are opening themselves to large fines under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and/or ePrivacy Directive for flouting the rules.</p>
<p>See, for example, these <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">two whopping fines handed to Google and Amazon in France</a> at the back end of last year for dropping tracking cookies without consent&#8230;</p>

<p>While those fines were certainly head-turning, we haven&#8217;t generally seen much EU enforcement on cookie consent &#8212; yet.</p>
<p>This is because data protection agencies have mostly taken a softly-softly approach to bringing sites into compliance. But there are signs enforcement is going to get a lot tougher. For one thing, DPAs have published detailed guidance on what proper cookie compliance looks like &#8212; so there are zero excuses for getting it wrong.</p>
<p>Some agencies had also been offering compliance grace periods to allow companies time to make the necessary changes to their cookie consent flows. But it&#8217;s now a full three years since the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection regime (GDPR) came into application. So, again, there&#8217;s no valid excuse to still have a horribly cynical cookie banner. It just means a site is trying its luck by breaking the law.</p>
<p>There is another reason to expect cookie consent enforcement to dial up soon, too: European privacy group <a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a> is today <a href="https://wecomply.noyb.eu">kicking off a major campaign</a> to clean up the trashfire of non-compliance &#8212; with a plan to file up to 10,000 complaints against offenders over the course of this year. And as part of this action it&#8217;s offering freebie guidance for offenders to come into compliance.</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s announcing the first batch of 560 complaints already filed against sites, large and small, located all over the EU (33 countries are covered). noyb said the complaints target companies that range from large players like Google and Twitter to local pages &#8220;that have relevant visitor numbers&#8221;.</p>
<p>“A whole industry of consultants and designers develop crazy click labyrinths to ensure imaginary consent rates. Frustrating people into clicking ‘okay’ is a clear violation of the GDPR’s principles. Under the law, companies must facilitate users to express their choice and design systems fairly. Companies openly admit that only 3% of all users actually want to accept cookies, but more than 90% can be nudged into clicking the ‘agree’ button,&#8221; said noyb chair and long-time EU privacy campaigner, Max Schrems, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Instead of giving a simple yes or no option, companies use every trick in the book to manipulate users. We have identified more than fifteen common abuses. The most common issue is that there is simply no ‘reject’ button on the initial page,&#8221; he added. “We focus on popular pages in Europe. We estimate that this project can easily reach 10,000 complaints. As we are funded by donations, we provide companies a free and easy settlement option &#8212; contrary to law firms. We hope most complaints will quickly be settled and we can soon see banners become more and more privacy friendly.”</p>
<p>To scale its action, noyb developed a tool which automatically parses cookie consent flows to identify compliance problems (such as no opt out being offered at the top layer; or confusing button coloring; or bogus &#8216;legitimate interest&#8217; opt-ins, to name a few of the many chronicled offences); and automatically create a draft report which can be emailed to the offender after it&#8217;s been reviewed by a member of the not-for-profit&#8217;s legal staff.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an innovative, scalable approach to tackling systematically cynical cookie manipulation in a way that could really move the needle and clean up the trashfire of horrible cookie pop-ups.</p>
<p>noyb is even giving offenders a warning first &#8212; and a full month to clean up their ways &#8212; before it will file an official complaint with their relevant DPA (which could lead to an eye-watering fine).</p>
<p>Its first batch of complaints are focused on the OneTrust consent management platform (CMP), one of the most popular template tools used in the region &#8212; and which European privacy researchers have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/cookie-consent-tools-are-being-used-to-undermine-eu-privacy-rules-study-suggests/">previously shown</a> (cynically) provides its client base with ample options to set non-compliant choices like pre-checked boxes&#8230; Talk about taking the biscuit.</p>

<p>A noyb spokeswoman said it&#8217;s started with OneTrust because its tool is popular but confirmed the group will expand the action to cover other CMPs in the future.</p>
<p>The first batch of noyb&#8217;s cookie consent complaints reveal the rotten depth of dark patterns being deployed &#8212; with 81% of the 500+ pages not offering a reject option on the initial page (meaning users have to dig into sub-menus to try to find it); and 73% using &#8220;deceptive colors and contrasts&#8221; to try to trick users into clicking the &#8216;accept&#8217; option.</p>
<p>noyb&#8217;s assessment of this batch also found that a full 90% did not provide a way to easily withdraw consent as the law requires.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158886" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158886" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2158886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Stats_en.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158886" class="wp-caption-text">Cookie compliance problems found in the first batch of sites facing complaints (Image credit: noyb)</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a snapshot of truly massive enforcement failure. But dodgy cookie consents are now operating on borrowed time.</p>
<p>Asked if it was able to work out how prevalent cookie abuse might be across the EU based on the sites it crawled, noyb&#8217;s spokeswoman said it was difficult to determine, owing to technical difficulties encountered through its process, but she said an initial intake of 5,000 websites was whittled down to 3,600 sites to focus on. And of those it was able to determine that 3,300 violated the GDPR.</p>
<p>That still left 300 &#8212; as either having technical issues or no violations &#8212; but, again, the vast majority (90%) were found to have violations. And with so much rule-breaking going on it really does require a systematic approach to fixing the &#8216;bogus consent&#8217; problem &#8212; so noyb&#8217;s use of automation tech is very fitting.</p>
<p>More innovation is also on the way from the not-for-profit &#8212; which told us it&#8217;s working on an automated system that will allow Europeans to &#8220;signal their privacy choices in the background, without annoying cookie banners&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time of writing it couldn&#8217;t provide us with more details on how that will work (presumably it will be some kind of browser plug-in) but said it will be publishing more details &#8220;in the next weeks&#8221; &#8212; so hopefully we&#8217;ll learn more soon.</p>
<p>A browser plug-in that can automatically detect and select the &#8216;reject all&#8217; button (even if only from a subset of the most prevalent CMPs) sounds like it could revive the &#8216;do not track&#8217; dream. At the very least, it would be a powerful weapon to fight back against the scourge of dark patterns in cookie banners and kick non-compliant cookies to digital dust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech in Africa is a goldmine. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are betting big on startups offering a plethora of services from payments and lending to neobanks, remittances and cross-border transfers, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rightfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of these services solves unique sets of challenges. For cross-border payments, it&#8217;s the outrageous rates and regulatory hassles involved with completing transactions from one African country to another</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://chippercash.com/">Chipper Cash</a>, a three-year-old startup that facilitates cross-border payment across Africa, has closed a $100 million Series C round to introduce more products and grow its team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It hasn&#8217;t been too long ago since Chipper Cash was last in the news. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2020, the African cross-border fintech startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/african-fintech-startup-chipper-cash-raises-30m-backed-by-jeff-bezos/">raised $30 million Series B</a> led by Ribbit Capital and Jeff Bezos fund Bezos Expeditions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This was after closing a $13.8 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/african-payment-startup-chipper-cash-raises-13-8m-series-a/">Series A round</a> from Deciens Capital and other investors in June 2020. Hence, Chipper Cash has gone through three rounds totalling $143.8 million in a year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when the $8.4 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/chipper-cash-convinces-joe-montana-to-invest-in-african-fintech/">raised in two seed rounds</a> back in 2019 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is included</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this number increases to $152.2 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.svb.com/svb-capital">SVB Capital</a>, the investment arm of U.S. high-tech commercial bank Silicon Valley Bank led this Series C round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others who participated in this round include existing investors &#8212; Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions, One Way Ventures, 500 Startups, Tribe Capital, and Brue2 Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipper Cash </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018 by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamserunjogi"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ham Serunjogi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maijid/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Maijid Moujaled.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair met in Iowa after coming to the U.S. for studies. Following their stints at big names like Facebook, Flickr and Yahoo!, the founders decided to work on their own startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company which offers mobile-based, no fee,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">P2P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payment services, was present in seven countries: Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it has expanded to a new territory outside Africa. &#8220;We&#8217;ve expanded to the U.K., it&#8217;s the first market we&#8217;ve expanded to outside Africa,&#8221; CEO Serunjogi said to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition and as a sign of growth, the company which boasts more than 200 employees plans to increase its workforce by hiring 100 staff throughout the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The number of users on Chipper Cash has increased to 4 million, up 33% from last year. And w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hile the company averaged 80,000 transactions daily in November 2020 and processed $100 million in payments value in June 2020, it is unclear what those figures are now as Serunjogi declined to comment on them, including its revenues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we reported its Series B last year, Chipper Cash wanted to offer more business payment solutions, cryptocurrency trading options, and investment services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So what has been the progress since then? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve launched cards products in Nigeria and we&#8217;ve also launched our crypto product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re also launching our US stocks product in Uganda, Nigeria and a few other countries soon,&#8221; Serunjogi answered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adopted in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">African users are responsible for a sizeable chunk of transactions that take place on some global crypto-trading platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, African users accounted for $7 billion of the $8.3 billion in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/african-crypto-usage-spurs-luno-as-customers-reach-7m/">Luno&#8217;s total trading volume</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance P2P users in Africa also <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2021/05/17/binance-users-grow/">grew 2,000%</a> within the past five months while their volumes increased by over 380%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals and small businesses across Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya account for most of the crypto activity on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipper Cash is active in these countries and <a href="https://chippercash.com/bitcoin/">tapping into this opportunity</a> is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a no brainer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our approach to growing products and adding products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on what our users find valuable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can imagine, crypto is one technology that has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adopted in Africa and many emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we want to give them the power to access crypto and to be able to buy, hold, and sell crypto whenever,&#8221; the CEO added.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2159198 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="314" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png 1298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?resize=768,354 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-148.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its crypto service isn&#8217;t available in Nigeria, the largest crypto market in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind this is the Central Bank of Nigeria&#8217;s (CBN) regulation on crypto activities in the country prohibiting users from converting fiat into crypto from their bank accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To survive, most crypto players have adopted P2P methods but Chipper Cash isn&#8217;t offering that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd according to Serunjogi, the company is &#8220;looking forward to any development in Nigeria that allows it to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be offered</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">freely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for the investment service Chipper Cash plans to roll out in Nigeria and Uganda soon. Presently, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria’s capital market regulator SEC is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/nigerias-sec-warns-investment-platforms-to-stop-trading-unregistered-foreign-securities/">keeping tabs on local investment platforms</a> and bringing their activities under its purview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Chipper Cash will not be exempt when the product is live in Nigeria and has begun engaging regulators to be ahead of the curve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As fintech explodes and as innovation continues to move forward, consumers have to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be protected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We invest millions of dollars every year in our compliance programs, so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> working </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the regulators </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that these products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are offered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a compliant manner is important,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Serunjogi noted. </span></p>
<h2>Six billion-dollar companies in Africa; the fifth fintech unicorn?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During our call, Serunjogi made some remarks about Nigeria&#8217;s central bank which resembles comments made by Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga Agboola back in March</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While acknowledging the central banks in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda for creating environments where innovation can thrive, he said: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nigeria has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the most exciting and vibrant tech ecosystem in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&#8217;s credit </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to CBN for creating and fostering an environment that allowed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups like ourselves and others like Flutterwave to blossom.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>Most fintechs would argue that the CBN stifles innovation but comments from both CEOs seems to suggest otherwise. From all indication, Chipper Cash and Flutterwave strive to be on the right side of the country&#8217;s apex bank policies and regulations. It is why they are one of the fastest-growing fintechs in the region and also billion-dollar companies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re not getting into our valuation, but we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the most valuable private startup in Africa today after this round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that&#8217;s a reflection of the environment that regulators like CBN have created to allowed innovation and growth,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Serunjogi commented when asked about the company&#8217;s valuation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until last week, the only private unicorn startup in Africa this year was Flutterwave. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then China-backed and African-focused fintech OPay came along as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company was reported to be in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">raising $400 million at a $1.5 billion valuation</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Serunjogi&#8217;s comment is anything to go by, Chipper Cash might currently be valued between $1-2 billion thus joining the exclusive billion-dollar club</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to be sure, I asked Serunjogi again if the company is indeed a unicorn. This time, he gave a more cryptic answer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re not commenting on the size of our valuation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things that I&#8217;ve been quite keen on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">externally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that the valuation of our company has not been a focus for us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s not a goal we&#8217;re aspiring to achieve. For us, the thing that drives us is that we have a product that is impactful to our users.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serunjogi added that this investment actualizes the importance of possessing a solid balance sheet and onboarding SVB Capital and getting existing investors to double down is a means to that end</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to him, a strong balance sheet </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will provide the infrastructure needed to support key long-term investments which will translate to more exciting products down the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We look at our investors as key partners to the business. So having very strong partners around the table makes us a stronger company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are partners who can put capital into our business, and we&#8217;re also able to learn from them in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other ways,&#8221; he said of the investors backing the three-year-old company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Ribbit Capital and Bezos Expeditions in last year&#8217;s Series B, this is SVB Capital&#8217;s first foray into the African market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, the managing director of SVB Capital <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilli">Tilli Bannett</a>, confirmed the fund&#8217;s investment in Chipper Cash</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the VC firm invested in Chipper Cash because it has created an easy and accessible way for people living in Africa to fulfil their financial needs through enhanced products and user experiences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a result, Chipper has had a phenomenal trajectory of consumer adoption and volume through the product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the role Chipper has forged for itself in fostering financial inclusion across Africa and the vast potential that still lies ahead,&#8221; she added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech remains the bright spot in African tech investment. In 2020, the sector accounted for more than 25% of the almost $1.5 billion raised by African startups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This figure will likely increase this year as four startups have raised $100 million rounds already: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/south-african-digital-bank-tymebank-lands-109m-from-uk-and-phillippines-investors/">TymeBank</a> in February, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a> in March, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">OPay</a> and Chipper Cash this May</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All except TymeBank are now valued at over $1 billion, and it becomes the first time Africa has witnessed two or more billion-dollar companies in a year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Jumia (e-commerce), Interswitch (fintech), and Fawry (fintech), the continent now has six billion-dollar tech companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s another interesting piece of information. The timeframe at which startups are reaching this landmark seems to be shortening. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it took Interswitch and Fawry seventeen and thirteen years </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it took Flutterwave five years; Jumia, four years; then OPay and Chipper Cash three years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>We reached out to the VC firm for comment regarding Chipper Cash&#8217;s valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel kicked off this year’s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/better-processor-thin-light-laptops.html#gs.2pn9zr">virtual Computex</a> by <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/better-processor-thin-light-laptops.html#gs.2pn9zr">announcing</a> two new 11th Gen U-Series chips for use in thin, lightweight laptops. It also unveiled its first 5G M.2 module for laptops, designed in a partnership with MediaTek (Intel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/apple-acquiring-most-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business-1b-deal/">sold its smartphone modem business to Apple in 2019</a>).</p>
<p>Both of Intel’s new chips have Intel Irix Xe graphics. The flagship model is the Core i7-1195G7, which has base clock speed is 2.9 GHz, but can reach up to 5.0 GHz on a single core using Intel’s Turbo Boost Max 3.0 tech. The other chip, called the Core i5-1155G7, has a base clock speed of 2.5GHzm and a maximum of 4.5GHz. Both chips have four cores and eight threads.</p>

<p>The 5G M.2 module, called the “5G Solution 5000,” supports 5G NR midband, sub-6GHz frequencies and eSIM tech. Intel has partnerships with telecoms in North America, EMEA, APAC, Japan and Australia. The module is expected to be in laptops produced by Acer, ASUS, HP and other manufacturers by the end of this year, and OEMs are also working on 250 designs based on 11th Gen U-Series chips, expected to hit the market by the holidays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The vast majority of people in India, the world’s second most populous nation, don’t have health insurance coverage. A significant portion of the population that does have coverage get it from their employers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plumhq.com">Plum</a>, a young startup that is making it easier and more affordable for more firms in the nation to provide insurance coverage to their employees, said on Monday it has raised $15.6 million in its Series A funding to accelerate its growth.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the new funding round, with participation from existing investors Sequoia Capital India’s Surge, Tanglin Venture Partners, Incubate Fund, and Gemba Capital. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">reported</a> earlier this year that Plum was in talks with Tiger Global for the new financing round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kunal Shah (founder of Cred), Gaurav Munjal, Roman Saini and Hemesh Singh (founders of Unacademy), Lalit Keshre, Harsh Jain and Ishan Bansal (founders of Groww), Ramakant Sharma and Anuj Srivastava (founders of Livspace), and Douglas Feirstein (founder of Hired) also participated in the new round, which brings one-a-half-year-old startup’s to-date raise to $20.6 million.</p>
<p>Plum offers health insurance coverage on a B2B2C model. The startup partners with small businesses to provide health insurance coverage to all their employees (and their family members), charging as little as $1 a month for an employee.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2159214 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="571" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plum-app-india.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The startup has developed the insurance stack from scratch and partnered with insurers to include additional coverage on pre-existing conditions and dental, said Abhishek Poddar, co-founder and chief executive of Plum, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>(Like fintech firms, which partner with banks and NBFCs to provide credit to customers, online insurance startups maintain partnerships with insurers to provide health insurance coverage. Plum maintains partnerships with ICICI Lombard, Care Health, Star Health and New India Assurance.)</p>
<p>Poddar, who has worked at Google and McKinsey, said Plum is making it increasingly affordable and enticing for businesses to choose the startup as their partner. Most insurance firms and online aggregators in India today currently serve consumers. There are very few players that engage with businesses. Even among those that do, they tend to be costlier and not as flexible.</p>
<p>Plum offers its partnered client&#8217;s employees the option to top up their health insurance coverage or extend it to additional members of the family. Unlike its competitors that require all the premium to be paid annually, Plum gives its clients the ability to pay each month. And signing up an entire firm for Plum takes less than an hour.</p>
<p>The speed is a key differentiator for Plum. Small businesses have to typically spend months in negotiating with other insurers. Bangalore-based Razorpay has also partnered with Plum to give the fintech startup’s clients a three-click, one-minute option to sign up for insurance coverage.</p>

<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to further expand its offerings, making its platform open to smaller businesses with teams as small as seven employees to sign up, said Poddar. The startup plans to cover 10 million people in India with insurance by 2025, and eventually expand to international markets, he said.</p>
<p>India has an under-penetrated insurance market. Within the under-penetrated landscape, digital distribution through web-aggregators today accounts for just 1% of the industry, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent report.</p>
<p>“As India’s healthcare insurance industry rapidly expands and transforms, Plum is well positioned to make comprehensive health insurance accessible to millions of Indians. We are excited to partner with Abhishek, Saurabh and the Plum team as they scale their leading tech-enabled platform to employers across the country,&#8221; said Scott Shleifer, Partner at Tiger Global, in a statement.</p>
<p>Plum is the latest investment from Tiger Global in India this year. The hedge fund, which has backed over 20 Indian unicorns, has emerged as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/?tpcc=ECTW2020">most prolific investor in Indian startups in recent months</a>, winning founders with its pace of investment, check size and favorable terms. Last week, the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/tiger-global-koo-app-twitter/">invested in Indian social network Koo</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jai Kisan, an Indian startup that is attempting to bring financial services to rural India, where commercial banks have a single-digit penetration, said on Monday it has raised $30 million in a new financing round as it looks to scale its business.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people in India today live in rural areas. Most of them don&#8217;t have a credit score. The professions they work on &#8212; largely farming &#8212; aren&#8217;t considered a business by most lenders in India. These farmers and other professionals also don&#8217;t have a documented credit history, which puts them in a risky category for banks to grant them a loan.</p>
<p>Much of the credit these people do raise ends up getting invested in unproductive usage, which leads to higher interest and default rates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Three-year-old Mumbai-headquartered <a href="http://jai-kisan.com">Jai Kisan</a> is attempting to address this by treating farmers and other similar professionals as businesses instead of consumers.</p>
<p>The startup has developed its own system &#8212; which it calls Bharat Khata &#8212; that is helping individuals and businesses get access to cheaper financing and ensures that the money they raise is being used for agri-inputs and equipment and other income generating purposes and enablement of rural commerce transactions.</p>
<p>Arjun Ahluwalia, co-founder and chief executive of Jai Kisan, said financial services is crucial for these individuals as their entire economy depends on it. &#8220;The ability to buy now and pay later is how most people shop for things in India. Credit is an expectation by the Indian customer &#8212; it&#8217;s not a value added service,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is availability of formal financing to customers, it&#8217;s not just customer who does well. The entire ecosystem that revolves around that customer benefits,&#8221; he said, pointing to the rise of Bajaj Finance, which has helped several businesses flourish in India by giving credit to customers at the time of purchase, and Xiaomi, India&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/xiaomi-india-localization/">largest smartphone vendor</a>, which sells a large number of its devices to customers on monthly instalment plans.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159207" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159207" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2159207 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="984" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jai-kisan-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159207" class="wp-caption-text">Ahluwalia at a conference in 2019 (India FinTech Forum)</p></div></p>
<p>Bharat Khata service, which was launched in April last year, captured more than $380 million of annualized GTV run-rate across over 25,000 storefronts by the financial year that ended in March this year, the startup said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jai Kisan has financed over 15% of the transactions which portrays the monetizability and quality of commerce being captured. The ability to have visibility and virality of high-quality transactions has enabled Jai Kisan to scale business by over 50% in 3 months. The unprecedented growth trajectory stands testament to Jai Kisan’s capabilities to deploy capital efficiently by focusing on core customer credit needs,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>The startup, which operates in eight Indian states in South India, is now looking to scale its presence across the country and also increase the headcount. On Monday, it said it had raised $30 million in a Series A round led by Mirae Asset, Syngenta Ventures, and existing investors Blume, Arkam Ventures, NABVENTURES, Prophetic Ventures and Better Capital.</p>
<p>An unspecified amount of the financing was raised as debt from Blacksoil, Stride Ventures, and Trifecta Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jai Kisan is at the cusp of disrupting the rural financing industry and we’re glad to be a part of their growth story. Jai Kisan’s stellar growth, excellent asset quality and expanding footprint make them a highly differentiated player in the segment,&#8221; said Ashish Dave, chief executive of the India Venture Investments for the South Korean firm Mirae Asset.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mirae Asset has always believed in backing companies which aim to become category leaders which is evident from our other investments and we believe Jai Kisan is on the journey of doing so for rural finance,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Like most fintech startups, Jai Kisan has so far relied on its banking and other financial institutions to finance credit to businesses. The startup said it will now finance 20% of all loans by itself. Which is why it is also raising some money in debt in the new round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Delhivery, India’s largest independent e-commerce logistics startup, has raised $277 million in what is expected to be the final funding round before the firm files for an IPO later this year.</p>
<p>In a regulatory filing, the Gurgaon-headquartered startup disclosed it had raised $277 million in a round led by Boston-headquartered investment firm Fidelity. Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, Abu Dhabi’s Chimera, and UK&#8217;s Baillie Gifford also participated in the new round, a name* of which the startup didn&#8217;t specify.</p>
<p>The new round valued the 10-year-old startup at about $3 billion. Delhivery &#8212; which also counts SoftBank Vision Fund, Tiger Global Management, Times Internet, The Carlyle Group, and Steadview Capital among its investors &#8212; has raised about $1.23 billion to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Delhivery began its life <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/delhivery-seriesd/">as a food delivery firm</a>, but has since shifted to a full suite of logistics services in over 2,300 Indian cities and more than 17,500 zip codes.</p>
<p>It is among a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/indias-blackbuck-raises-150-million-to-digitize-freight-and-logistics-across-india/">handful of startups</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/rivigo-india-seriese/">attempting to digitize</a> the demand and supply system of the logistics market through a freight exchange platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159174" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159174" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2159174 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="508" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159174" class="wp-caption-text">Research and image: Bernstein</p></div></p>
<p>Its platform connects consigners, agents and truckers offering road transport solutions. The startup says the platform reduces the role of brokers, makes some of its assets such as trucking &#8212; the most popular transportation mode for Delhivery &#8212; more efficient, and ensures round the clock operations.</p>
<p>This digitization is crucial to address the inefficiencies in the Indian logistics industry that has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d529d48c-dc1b-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482">long stunted</a> the national economy. Poor planning and forecasting of demand and supply increases the carrying costs, theft, damages, and delays, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report last month about India’s logistics market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.delhivery.com">Delhivery</a>, which says it has delivered over 1 billion orders, works with “all of India’s largest e-commerce companies and leading enterprises,” according to its website, where it also says the startup has worked with over 10,000 customers. For the last leg of the delivery, its couriers are assigned an area that never exceeds 2 sq km, allowing them to make several delivery runs a day to save time.</p>
<p>Indian logistics market’s TAM (total addressable market) is over $200 billion, Bernstein analysts said.</p>
<p>The startup said late last year that it was planning to invest over $40 million within two years to expand and increase its fleet size to meet the growing demand of orders as more people shop online amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>(*Indian news outlet Entrackr, which <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/05/exclusive-ipo-bound-delhivery-raises-277-mn-led-by-fidelity/">first reported</a> on the filing, suggested it&#8217;s a Series H round. But according to insight platform Tracxn, there is no record of a Series G round for Delhivery. The startup didn&#8217;t comment on Sunday.)</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to meeting compliance standards, many startups are dominating the alphabet. From GDPR and CCPA to SOC 2, ISO27001, PCI DSS and HIPAA, companies have been charging toward meeting the compliance standards required to operate their businesses.</p>
<p>Today, every healthcare founder knows their product must meet HIPAA compliance, and any company working in the consumer space would be well aware of GDPR, for example.</p>
<p>But a mistake many high-growth companies make is that they treat compliance as a catchall phrase that includes security. Thinking this could be an expensive and painful error. In reality, compliance means that a company meets a minimum set of controls. Security, on the other hand, encompasses a broad range of best practices and software that help address risks associated with the company’s operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It makes sense that startups want to tackle compliance first. Being compliant plays a big role in any company’s geographical expansion to regulated markets and in its penetration to new industries like finance or healthcare. So in many ways, achieving compliance is a part of a startup’s go-to-market kit. And indeed, enterprise buyers expect startups to check the compliance box before signing on as their customer, so startups are rightfully aligning around their buyers’ expectations.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			One of the best ways startups can begin tackling security is with an early security hire.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, it’s not surprising that we’ve witnessed a trend where startups achieve compliance from the very early days and often prioritize this motion over developing an exciting feature or launching a new campaign to bring in leads, for instance.</p>
<p>Compliance is an important milestone for a young company and one that moves the cybersecurity industry forward. It forces startup founders to put security hats on and think about protecting their company, as well as their customers. At the same time, compliance provides comfort to the enterprise buyer’s legal and security teams when engaging with emerging vendors. So why is compliance alone not enough?</p>
<p>First, <em>compliance doesn’t mean security </em>(although it is a step in the right direction). It is more often than not that young companies are compliant while being vulnerable in their security posture.</p>
<p>What does it look like? For example, a software company may have met SOC 2 standards that require all employees to install endpoint protection on their devices, but it may not have a way to enforce employees to actually activate and update the software. Furthermore, the company may lack a centrally managed tool for monitoring and reporting to see if any endpoint breaches have occurred, where, to whom and why. And, finally, the company may not have the expertise to quickly respond to and fix a data breach or attack.</p>
<p>Therefore, although compliance standards are met, several security flaws remain. The end result is that startups can suffer security breaches that end up costing them a bundle. For companies with under 500 employees, the average security breach costs an estimated $7.7 million, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/services/cost-of-insider-threats/#/">according to a study by IBM</a>, not to mention the brand damage and lost trust from existing and potential customers.</p>
<p>Second, an unforeseen danger for startups is that compliance can create a false sense of safety. Receiving a compliance certificate from objective auditors and renowned organizations could give the impression that the security front is covered.</p>
<p>Once startups start gaining traction and signing upmarket customers, that sense of security grows, because if the startup managed to acquire security-minded customers from the F-500, being compliant must be enough for now and the startup is probably secure by association. When charging after enterprise deals, it’s the buyer&#8217;s expectations that push startups to achieve SOC 2 or ISO27001 compliance to satisfy the enterprise security threshold. But in many cases, enterprise buyers don’t ask sophisticated questions or go deeper into understanding the risk a vendor brings, so startups are never really called to task on their security systems.</p>
<p>Third, compliance only deals with a defined set of knowns. It doesn’t cover anything that is unknown and new since the last version of the regulatory requirements were written.</p>

<p>For example, APIs are growing in use, but regulations and compliance standards have yet to catch up with the trend. So an e-commerce company must be PCI-DSS compliant to accept credit card payments, but it may also leverage multiple APIs that have weak authentication or business logic flaws. When the PCI standard was written, APIs weren’t common, so they aren’t included in the regulations, yet now most fintech companies rely heavily on them. So a merchant may be PCI-DSS compliant, but use nonsecure APIs, potentially exposing customers to credit card breaches.</p>
<p>Startups are not to blame for the mix-up between compliance and security. It is difficult for any company to be both compliant and secure, and for startups with limited budget, time or security know-how, it’s especially challenging. In a perfect world, startups would be both compliant and secure from the get-go; it’s not realistic to expect early-stage companies to spend millions of dollars on bulletproofing their security infrastructure. But there are some things startups can do to become more secure.</p>
<p>One of the best ways startups can begin tackling security is with an early security hire. This team member might seem like a “nice to have” that you could put off until the company reaches a major headcount or revenue milestone, but I would argue that a head of security is a key early hire because this person’s job will be to focus entirely on analyzing threats and identifying, deploying and monitoring security practices. Additionally, startups would benefit from ensuring their technical teams are security-savvy and keep security top of mind when designing products and offerings.</p>
<p>Another tactic startups can take to bolster their security is to deploy the right tools. The good news is that startups can do so without breaking the bank; there are many security companies offering open-source, free or relatively affordable versions of their solutions for emerging companies to use, including Snyk, Auth0, HashiCorp, CrowdStrike and Cloudflare.</p>
<p>A full security rollout would include software and best practices for identity and access management, infrastructure, application development, resiliency and governance, but most startups are unlikely to have the time and budget necessary to deploy all pillars of a robust security infrastructure.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are resources like <a href="https://www.security4startups.com/">Security 4 Startups</a> that offer a free, open-source framework for startups to figure out what to do first. The guide helps founders identify and solve the most common and important security challenges at every stage, providing a list of entry-level solutions as a solid start to building a long-term security program. In addition, compliance automation tools can help with continuous monitoring to ensure these controls stay in place.</p>
<p>For startups, compliance is critical for establishing trust with partners and customers. But if this trust is eroded after a security incident, it will be nearly impossible to regain it. Being secure, not only compliant, will help startups take trust to a whole other level and not only boost market momentum, but also make sure their products are here to stay.</p>
<p>So instead of equating compliance with security, I suggest expanding the equation to consider that compliance <em>and</em> security equal trust. And trust equals business success and longevity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A venture capitalist once told me candidly that whenever you see the phrase &#8220;democratization&#8221; in tech marketing material, think of it as a red flag. Democracy, generally speaking, often comes with an ironic caveat: It disproportionately benefits white and male participants. Now, you know me well enough to know that I wouldn’t start off your Saturday with this dreary of an introduction normally, but I think that that reality is why a new tool, championed by tech entrepreneurs Lolita and Josh Taub, could be on to something actually innovative.</p>
<p>The Taubs have launched a GP-LP, or general partner and limited partner, <a href="https://www.notion.so/lolitataub/GP-LP-Matching-Tool-a294b1d887ed46d7892f66f826a5631f">matching tool</a> to help underrepresented fund managers get access to the capital they need to start their fund. The match-making tool connects those looking to raise funds (GPs!) with check-writers (LPs!). The move comes on the heels of their founder-investor matching tool, which to date has generated over 1,000 introductions that they say have led to 27 checks totaling nearly $4 million in total capital.</p>
<p>Yes, matching LPs to GPs is a relatively simple tech and concept. And this is a relatively simple experiment. But, it couldn’t have existed five, and definitely 10, years ago. Zoom investing has changed the way that people meet and vet, and I think the GP-LP tool is a key data point in how emerging fund managers can bring optionality to their fundraising process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>Speaking of fundraising:</em></p>

</ul>
<p>The tool’s explicit focus on only helping underrepresented folks &#8212; which it defines as anyone who doesn’t fit the classic Silicon Valley mold like women, LGBTQ+ folks, non-Ivy grads (or people from non-elite employers) and non-wealthy individuals &#8212; is a layer of differentiation from many other tools out there. Products like the AngelList rolling fund are great, but public, ongoing fundraising still largely benefits those who have networks to tap into in the first place — just take <a href="https://www.angellist.com/rolling">a quick scroll</a> to see who has one so far.</p>
<p>Let me put it like this: We’ve gotten to a point in venture where there are an ample number of tools out there that help founders and investors leverage their community into checks. What’s missing, though, are the tools that help the community-less, undernetworked and underestimated access those opportunities. While there still is LP hesitancy as emerging managers raise their second and third funds, this effort is a good step in the right direction. And I’ll be tracking it to see how successfully it works.</p>

<p>Disaster tech, such as startups that use data to fight wildfires or analyze brainwaves to analyze PTSD after a traumatic event, is having a moment. Are you surprised? COVID-19 and the ongoing climate crisis have energized entrepreneurs to build proactive solutions that fight literal disaster. Our own Danny Crichton spent 12,000 words mapping out the landscape so you don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The Equity team boiled down those 12,000 words on disaster into a 20-minute episode focused on top takeaways and highlights.

<p>Since travel first shut down last March, all eyes have been on Airbnb, the travel and short-term rental company with global name recognition. Nearly a year ago, the company cited revenue declines and cut 1,900 jobs, roughly 25% of its workforce. Now, as digital nomadic lifestyles and long-term travel come back, it has a growth story worth sharing, too.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky sat down with our own Jordan Crook to talk about how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/brian-chesky-describes-a-faster-nimbler-post-pandemic-airbnb/">his company is preparing for a faster, nimbler post-pandemic reality.</a> Time will tell if Airbnb’s stance pans out, but getting into the head of one of the co-founders of a business pummeled, then resurrected, by this pandemic can give founders some tactical tips on how to frame conflict and what’s next.</p>
<blockquote><p>Brian Chesky: Little did I know that a travel company in a pandemic might even be crazier than starting a company based on strangers living together. I kind of feel like I’m now 39 going on 49. It was definitely the craziest year ever.</p>
<p>Our business initially dropped 80% in eight weeks. I say it’s like driving a car. You can’t go 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, and expect nothing really bad to happen. Now imagine you’re going 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, then rebuild the car kind of while still moving, and then try to accelerate into an IPO, all on Zoom.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p><em>Hello from Friday, I presume that you are currently enjoying the long weekend. In celebration for this week’s Exchange letter we’ll try something new by being brief. </em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you are tired of hearing about cryptocurrencies, I have bad news. They are not only not going away, but it appears that the financial cannon that have helped clear the fields for their general advance are reloading with even more financial ammunition.</p>
<p>At least that’s what Eric Newcomer is reporting in a post out this week aptly titled “<a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/a16z-crypto-fund-balloons-to-2-billion">a16z Crypto Fund Balloons to $2 Billion</a>.”</p>
<p>This raises a few points. First! That there is enough LP demand to fund a crypto vehicle to the tune of $2 billion. Second! That there are enough hot crypto ideas out there worth sticking $2 billion into.</p>
<p>I can entirely believe the former, but the latter stretches my brain a little. Not that there aren’t great companies being built in the blockchain space; Coinbase’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">Q1 earnings</a> indicate that you can make money with crypto. But it seems that the firms that have proven the most successful thus far are more a hybrid of the traditional banking world and the crypto space than entirely inhabitants of the latter.</p>
<p>But as those ideas have been mined to increasing perfection, we should anticipate seeing money chase the more experimental crypto ideas. As I noted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/daily-crunch-12/">the Daily Crunch yesterday</a>, there’s a lot of money already going into those markets:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Y]ou’ve heard of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. If you have already digested the NBA TopShot hype wave, buckle in, because a lot of folks are still building in the NFT world. That includes Anima, which is bringing AR to NFTs and just raised new capital from Coinbase, and Infinite Objects, which just raised $6 million to help folks bring their NFTs IRL.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is where venture investing in crypto &#8212; and that mammoth a16z fund &#8212; gets interesting.</p>
<p>Sure, crypto exchanges can make money. But what about the further reaches of the crypto economy? Can they build material revenues that the fiat world can understand and go public? (Do they even want to go public?)</p>
<p>It’s a pleasure to watch other people wager other people’s money on ideas that may fail. Heads they lose, tails we win. Not bad!</p>
<h2>Twitter’s subscription (and media?) moment</h2>
<p>Twitter’s “Blue” subscription product is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/twitter-blue-a-3-monthly-subscription-service-could-be-coming-soon/">slowly dripping its way into the market</a>. I’m going to buy it, whatever it is.</p>
<p>But what I can’t get out of my head is that Twitter is very well positioned to build a sort of creator nirvana. After all, Twitter is already where many writers, journalists and artists hang out. Where we already have a following. Why not help us weirdos leverage all the time we’ve spent on the platform?</p>
<p>You can see how this could scale. Now that Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">bought startups Revue and Scroll</a>, it could build a newsletter platform where Blue subscriber money is divvied up amongst writers for its platform. Or Twitter could buy Medium, as a friend suggested to me the other day. Medium has a huge subscriber base, which Twitter could merge into Blue and provide a sort of extra-social-network-network for writers and other creatives. Right?</p>
<p>If I had a few billion dollars, a few thousand engineers and a dictate from shareholders to grow, I’d go hog-wild and do some crazy shit. Let’s see what Twitter comes up with, but let’s hope that they aren’t making small plans.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For many VCs, the exit is the endgame; you cash in and move on. But as we know, the startup world is evolving, and that means the impact of investment is no longer limited to how much money is made.</p>
<p>As investors, we’re looking further into what each investment <em>means</em> to human beings, at interlinking our mission with our money. And yet, one of the events that generates the most momentum for long-term impact &#8212; the successful exit of a portfolio company &#8212; is not being harnessed.</p>
<p>When leveraged properly, an exit can be the beginning of a firm’s true impact, especially when we’re talking about giving all founders equal opportunities and empowering the best ideas. The investment sphere is slowly shaking off its “America first” approach as foreign products take the world by storm and international businesses become the norm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When leveraged properly, an exit can be the beginning of a firm’s true impact, especially when we’re talking about giving all founders equal opportunities and empowering the best ideas.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Investors will be driving forces in enabling the highest-potential companies to build products that countries everywhere will benefit from &#8212; no matter where they were conceived. The way they play the game can transform the industry into one in which a founder from across the ocean has as much of a chance to change the world as one from next door.</p>
<p>We know the basics of how to do this with cash: Investing in underrepresented founders is a necessary first step. But who’s talking about the power of exits to change the playing field for diverse founders? We must consider the psychological motivation of seeing a huge buyout on other entrepreneurs, what that startup’s ex-team members go on to build, and what the achievements of one citizen does for that nation’s reputation.</p>
<p>Last year, 41 venture-backed companies saw a billion-dollar exit, totaling over $100 billion, the<a href="https://theventure.city/status-of-vc-q4-2020/"> highest numbers</a> in a decade. We have an unprecedented amount of clout to do something with those power moves and four ways to turn them into a domino effect.</p>
<h2>1. Competitor effect</h2>
<p>When a foreign entrepreneur raises money from U.S. firms and sells to a U.S. company, other immigrants see that. Regardless of how groundbreaking their product idea might be, immigrant Americans will always be more wary of putting their eggs into the entrepreneurship basket, at least as long as 93% of all VC money continues to be<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethedwards/2021/02/24/check-your-stats-the-lack-of-diversity-in-venture-capital-is-worse-than-it-looks/?sh=6c2586a8185d"> controlled by white men</a>.</p>
<p>This, despite research suggesting that immigrants contribute<a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/how-immigrants-drive-entrepreneurship-invention-innovation/"> 40% more to innovation</a> than local inventors.</p>
<p>What these foreign entrepreneurs most need is confidence, role models and success stories proving other people who look like them have made it, especially when those founders are making waves in the same industry as them.</p>
<p>So a big, well-publicized exit will create momentum in the industry for other foreign founders to give fuel to their venture and seek to take it to the next stage. Not only that, it will instill more self-assurance when it comes to fundraising, and investors will value that.</p>
<p>I was inspired to write this column after Returnly, a fintech founded by a fellow immigrant from Spain based in San Francisco &#8212; which, for full transparency, I invested in as an angel investor, and then for Series B and C via my fund &#8212; was acquired for<a href="https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-to-acquire-returnly"> $300 million by Affirm</a>.</p>
<p>While there was undoubtedly a personal financial gain worth celebrating, the success of a foreign founder who persevered against the odds in such a competitive ecosystem as Silicon Valley, raised large rounds from U.S.-based investors, and was finally acquired by a U.S. company served as a moment of inspiration for other diverse founders around the world. We saw this in the amount of media attention it received in both business and mainstream press in Spain and the floods of connect requests and congratulations that followed on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>The impact of an exit is greater when it shows foreign entrepreneurs that there are globally minded organizations helping startups like theirs get equal access to funding. That means having VC firms that spotlight international entrepreneurship and foster global expert networks.</p>
<p>As investors, we can maximize the impact of our exits in the industry by highlighting the foreign origins of our founders in a big way when it comes to promoting the exit, including narrating the challenges and opportunities they encountered on their journey. We can use the victory to drive the point home to our fellow investors that diverse and international entrepreneurship is an undervalued gem. We can personally take the win to boost our brand as one that empowers foreign entrepreneurs in that niche, attracting more to seek funding with us in a positive reinforcement cycle.</p>
<h2>2. Wealth effect</h2>
<p>The windfall from a big exit puts all previous investors in a privileged position, and it’s unlikely that money will sit around for long. They’ll look to reinvest in other high-potential companies &#8212; probably ones that look a lot like the one that was just sold.</p>
<p>But in addition to those investors multiplying the positive impact in their own portfolio, they will rally other investors to behave in a similar way.</p>
<p>Each exit &#8212; good or bad &#8212; sets a precedent for that niche and that type of company. Other investors will follow suit if they sense that one of their peers is onto a cash cow. Because foreign and ethnic minority founders are still underrepresented in startup funding, it makes this field less competitive while harboring huge potential. VCs who have an eye out for unique opportunities will spot when an investor has made a hefty profit from an unconventional startup, especially if they continue to invest in others in that same field.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NTPHL1YhIP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/want-to-double-your-rate-of-return-seek-counsel-from-experienced-executives/">Want to double your rate of return? Seek counsel from experienced executives</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Want to double your rate of return? Seek counsel from experienced executives&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/want-to-double-your-rate-of-return-seek-counsel-from-experienced-executives/embed/#?secret=NTPHL1YhIP" data-secret="NTPHL1YhIP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To help this along, angels and VCs who’ve been behind a recent exit and are reinvesting in similar founders should publicize those knock-on investments, explaining how their previous success motivated them to support similar ventures. They can also be vocal within their network about their decision to raise up certain entrepreneurs because they’ve seen it works.</p>
<p>Returnly’s founder recently offered to put some of his earnings back into our fund, enabling more foreign entrepreneurs like himself to access capital. If as investors we foster meaningful relationships with our funders and truly care about empowering diverse entrepreneurs, we’ll see more of that wealth circle back into our mission.</p>
<h2>3. Team effect</h2>
<p>The PayPal Mafia is a set of former PayPal executives and employees &#8212; such as Elon Musk, a South African, and Peter Thiel, a German American &#8212; who have gone on to seriously disrupt not one but<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-mafia-members-careers-elon-musk-peter-thiel-reid-hoffman-2019-11#there-are-several-more-former-paypal-employees-who-went-on-to-have-careers-both-in-and-out-of-technology-29"> multiple industries</a> across tech. Among the companies they’ve founded are YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp and Tesla, and they’ve even been named U.S. ambassadors. That’s just one company. Imagine what other diverse and driven teams can do with the influx of cash and inspiration that comes with a big exit. There will be a ripple effect of team members eager to start out on their own who feel empowered by the success of someone who believed in them.</p>
<p>Their ventures will be more likely to “pass it on” when it comes to giving equal opportunities to people regardless of origin and will generate more jobs for people with their mission. Take Thiel, who has to date backed<a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/peter-thiel-european-investments/"> over 40 companies</a> in Europe alone.</p>
<p>As VCs, we can capitalize on this team effect by keeping our eye on any spinoff ventures that arise and supporting them when possible (with experience and contacts, if not with capital). But beyond this, you can also consider encouraging these people to join the investment sphere, maybe even within your firm. Many successful startup founders and executives go on to become investors &#8212; the PayPal Mafia has contributed to some of the most notorious funds out there today. The origin story of these former team members will make them more prone to supporting underrepresented founders they can get behind. In turn, new entrepreneurs will draw more value from their personal experiences.</p>
<h2>4. Reputation effect</h2>
<p>Although Returnly is headquartered in San Francisco, its founder is Spanish and many of its employees were based in Spain.</p>
<p>That means that the impact of Returnly’s exit will be felt on the other side of the Atlantic as well as among co-nationals in the United States. The same is true of other notable sales, like AlienVault, which was founded in Spain and had multiple offices there. AlienVault was<a href="https://elreferente.es/venture-capital/las-20-ventas-millonarias-mas-relevantes-de-startups-espanolas/"> acquired</a> by U.S. telecommunications giant AT&amp;T for $900 million. Or IPOs &#8212; earlier this month, the Spanish-origin payments company Flywire<a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/payments-specialist-flywire-files-for-ipo"> filed for an IPO</a> that could value the company at $3 billion. One startup’s success boosts the reputation of its entire team, and with it other founders and talent with their same country of origin, background, education and drive.</p>
<p>It follows that investors and other stakeholders will be more inclined to back opportunities among founders from the same home country if it says something about the mission, expertise and culture they bring to their startup.</p>
<p>At the same time, growing startups will be more interested in hiring the talent of evidently successful teams. That doesn’t just mean hiring more foreign experts in the United States, but seeking to outsource farther afield. We’re already becoming far more comfortable with remote teams, and it’s more capital-efficient for one half of the team to be working while the other half sleeps. But founders will always gravitate more to countries where local talent and innovation is already seen to be thriving. Open up that conversation with your portfolio companies.</p>
<p>VCs have the power to change an industry forever, to connect startup ecosystems across continents and to see startups expand worldwide. But this is about staying relevant as an investor as much as it’s about ensuring this next stage in the startup world is a positive one.</p>
<p>Investors who don’t recognize that the future of startups is global and diverse in nature won’t be in sync with the best opportunities &#8212; and won’t be selected by the best founders. Rather than trying to play catchup, help build that ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook this week will begin to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">publicly roll out the option to hide Likes on posts across both Facebook and Instagram</a>, following earlier<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/instagram-private-like-counts/"> tests</a> beginning in 2019. The project, which puts the decision about Likes in the hands of the company’s global user base, had been in development for years, but was deprioritized due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the response work required on Facebook’s part. When the company tested how people felt about Like counts, it got pushback from both sides &#8212; some wanted to see this information and others felt it was leading to a negative, competitive experience.</p>
<p>The company decided to split the difference and put the decision in its users&#8217; hands. Via new settings, users can choose to disable Like counts on the posts they make and those that appear when they browse the social apps&#8217; feeds.</p>
<p>The decision, however, indicates not one of user empowerment, but rather one representative of a company that&#8217;s so large (and intent on remaining the largest), it declines to have its own point of view on controversial matters for fear of causing a mass exit. You can see this in other areas of the business as well, like how it wanted to downplay its responsibility with regard to the misinformation it recirculated by leaving it to fact-checkers to handle, or how it offloaded hard decisions about takedowns to an advisory board. While it&#8217;s one thing to not want to piss off a large number of users, turning every toggle and setting into a user choice is just another way at shrugging off responsibility while claiming that something has been done.</p>
<h3>Poparazzi hypes and growth hacks to the top</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2157861" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157861" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2157861" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="284" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg 3282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=768,321 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=680,284 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=1536,642 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=2048,856 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-26-at-1.34.37-PM.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157861" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Poparazzi</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new app with its own point of view has made it to the top. Recently launched anti-selfie app <a href="https://www.poparazzi.xyz/">Poparazzi</a> sees itself as a referendum on the Instagram age of performative and self-obsessed social media. The app turns the &#8220;tag your friends in photos&#8221; feature from Instagram into a standalone, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">excellently marketed and growth-hacked app experience</a>.</p>
<p>Your Poparazzi profile can only be added to by your friends, which makes the app feel more authentic as it captures casual, unpolished moments, not those you&#8217;ve rehearsed and filtered to perfection. But the viral app favors giving up some user privacy protections for network effects, which could potentially be harmful. In the end, it also overlooks why people use social media today: self-expression. Posting pictures to other profiles doesn&#8217;t fulfill that desire. That means the app either become an additive experience to be used alongside your existing preferred social app, or one that&#8217;s risking a bet on a future where people are actually less self-involved.

<p>As the Apple-Epic App Store antitrust trial adjourns, the judge seemed <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-facing-potential-loss-in-app-store-antitrust-case-as-judge-turns-hostile">leaning more</a> to Epic&#8217;s point of view on specific matters, including the 30% cut Apple takes and its decision to ban companies from telling their customers where they could get a better deal on an in-app purchase. (Tim Cook taking the stand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/tim-cook-plays-innocent-in-epic-v-apples-culminating-testimony/">only to claim ignorance</a> of certain key aspects of the App Store business didn&#8217;t help matters, either.)</p>
<p>At its core, the case is about whether or not Apple is a monopoly and could set the tone for later lawsuits and government regulation. Epic believes Apple has a monopoly over distribution to the iPhone, but Apple argued there were plenty of other places for a company like Epic to sell its games &#8212; including those that Epic pays a cut to without complaint, like Microsoft and Sony. Epic, meanwhile, argued that its metaverse is more than just a game, it&#8217;s a social place to hang out.</p>
<p>The judge pointed out both Epic&#8217;s plain-as-day ulterior motives (hint: $$$$), but also the extent to which mobile games &#8212; games that make up the lion&#8217;s share of App Store revenue &#8212; seem to be subsidizing the platform for others. That includes apps where Apple doesn&#8217;t take a cut of IAPs.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/05/apple-epic-trial-antitrust-market-power-fortnite.html">for the judge to rule for Epic</a>, she would have to find that Apple leveraged its market power as a monopoly. And that means Apple has to actually <em>have</em> a monopoly in the first place. But does it? There are other places to buy apps (Google&#8217;s Android devices, e.g.) and games, like console platforms. Epic wants the definition of a monopoly here narrowed to the market for apps on Apple devices, and that may not work. Though the trial has adjourned, a decision will still be months out, so don&#8217;t worry about prepping your in-app credit card forms and PayPal buttons yet.</p>

<p><strong>Apple released its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-kicks-off-june-7/">agenda</a> for WWDC 2021, which will still be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/">virtual</a>. The keynote address will air June 7 at 10 AM PDT, followed by the Platform State of the Union at 2 PM PDT. </strong>The schedule also includes the Apple Design Awards on June 10 at 2 PM PDT. Plus, there will be more than 200 sessions and labs, as well as special activities and events. New this year is &#8220;Pavilions,&#8221; which will better organize event sessions, labs and activities around a given topic.</p>
<p><strong>With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-14-6-features/">iOS 14.6&#8217;s public launch</a></strong>, Apple released Apple Card Family and Apple Podcast subscriptions, Spatial Audio and lossless audio for Apple Music, added enhanced support for AirTags (you can now add emails for lost AirTags), and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/25/apple-made-shortcuts-run-faster-on-iphone-and-ipad-with-ios-14-6/">made Shortcuts actions run faster </a>on both iPhone and iPad, among other features.</p>

<p><strong>Apple&#8217;s new M1-powered iPad Pro can <a href="https://www.redmondpie.com/apples-new-m1-ipad-pro-can-download-ipados-updates-over-5g/">download</a> entire iPadOS updates over cellular,</strong> a support <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT212196">document</a> confirms. That means more devices will likely have new OS updates sooner than before.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=fwpxy9kw">updated age ratings setting</a> in App Store Connect</strong>. The Gambling and Contests setting is now split into two settings, allowing app developers to indicate these content types separately. They’re also indicated separately on the App Store. If your setting was previously yes or no, it will remain across both content types now if you don&#8217;t make any adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>App Annie<a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-strategy/what-are-the-top-sdks-since-the-ios-14-5-release/"> analyzed the top Apple SDKs</a> by iOS installs globally</strong> following the release of iOS 14.5. The top six were all in the tools and utilities categories, indicting many developers are looking for SDKs to add functionality to create better user experiences.</p>
<p><strong>ATT opt-in update.</strong> According to<a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/ios-14-att-dashboard/"> new data form AppsFlyer,</a> there were 78M instances were users saw an ATT prompt and allowed tracking. The advertiser side opt-in rates remain consistent at 35%-40%. In addition, spend in iOS apps increased 20% since ATT was enforced. Android budgets, by comparison, remained mostly the same (+2%).</p>
<p><strong>Apple pulled an app from the App Store that <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-pulls-iphone-app-forced-users-good-review?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheIphoneBlog+%28iMore%29">forced users to leave a good review</a>.</strong> The scammy app was yet another that developer Kosta Eleftheriou highlighted as an example of Apple dropping the ball on App Store fraud protection, user safety and security.</p>

<p>Recently launched from public beta, <a href="https://www.hoptale.com/">Hoptale</a> is ready to kick off the post-Covid summer travel season with its travel journal and discovery app. The startup uses smart technology to organize trip plans and your photos, and users metadata to create trips as well as &#8220;hops&#8221; within your trips &#8212; meaning the individual stops you made during trips at different locations. This creates a travel journal of sorts where you itinerary, points of interest, map and, optionally, your own commentary are organized for you.</p>
<p>You can also share trips publicly with the Hoptale community or privately with friends and family. That could make it easier for sharing your favorite recommendations with someone who wants to know what to do and see from a place you&#8217;ve already visited. The beta version had hundreds of users who cataloged thousands of trips, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hoptale-remember-your-journey/id1441363420">the app is now open</a> to the wider public.</p>

<p>Well, you have to see what all the hype is about, right? The <a href="https://www.poparazzi.xyz/">new social app</a> for iOS and Android offers Instagram-like photo profiles with one big difference: you can&#8217;t post pictures yourself. Instead, the app only allows users to post photos to their friends&#8217; profiles, arguing against the self-absorbed nature of today&#8217;s social media. After a lot of pre-launch hype on TikTok, the app shot to the top of the App Store at launch where it sits poised to be the viral trendy app of the post-COVID summer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Scotland's capital Edinburgh boasts a beautiful, hilly landscape, a robust education system and good access to grant funding, public and private investment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scotland is slowly but surely drawing attention in the UK&#8217;s startup space. In 2020, Scottish startups collectively raised £345 million, according to Tech Nation, and with nearly 2,500 startups, it has the highest number of budding tech companies outside London. Venture capital fundraises are also consistently on the rise every year.</p>
<p>Scotland&#8217;s capital Edinburgh boasts a beautiful, hilly landscape, a robust education system and good access to grant funding, public and private investment. It&#8217;s also one of the top financial centers in the U.K., making it a great place to begin a business.</p>
<p>So to find out what the startup scene in Edinburgh looks like, we spoke to six founders, executives and investors. The city&#8217;s tech ecosystem appears to have a robust space for machine learning, artificial intelligence, biomedicine, fintech, travel tech, oil, renewables, e-commerce, gaming, health tech, deep tech, space tech and insurtech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<hr />
<p>However, the city&#8217;s tech scene is apparently lackluster when it comes to legal tech, blockchain and consumer-facing technology.</p>
<p>Breakout companies that were founded in Edinburgh include Skyscanner and FanDuel. Notable among the current crop are Desana, Continuum Industries, Parsley Box, Current Health, Boundary, Zumo, Appointedd, Criton, Mallzee, TravelNest, TVSquared, Care Sourcer, Stampede, For-Sight, Vistalworks, Reath, InfraCost, Speech Graphics and Cyan Forensics.</p>
<p>The Edinburgh business-angel community appears to be quite strong, but it seems local founders find it difficult to get London-based investors to take an interest. Scottish investors are said to be &#8220;pretty conservative and risk-adverse&#8221; with some notable exceptions.</p>

<h2>Wendy Lamin, managing director, Holoxica</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s strong in space, biomedicine, fintech/insurtech, AI.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
The Scottish business-angel community is said to be the largest in Europe. It&#8217;s difficult to get London-based investors take an interest in Scotland — investors can tend to look at where companies are based. It is hard for &#8220;underrepresented founders&#8221; to get investments in Scotland and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Stay. Not always easy to get people to come and live in Scotland. Edinburgh, there are lots of prejudices, despite it being one of the best cities to live in in the whole of the U.K.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Good to see more focus on impact investing. Par Equity is one of Edinburgh&#8217;s biggest investors, whereas Archangels is one of the biggest angel investors. Poonam Malik is great for diversity and female entrepreneurs, and she is on the board of Scottish Enterprise, and is a social entrepreneur and investor. Garry Bernstein is also an investor — he leads the Scottish chapter of Tech London Advocates and Global Tech Advocates, and as such is the founder of Tech Scot Advocates.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Thriving. The government is doing its best for the tech sector. Education in tech is currently an issue, though. Hope Brexit won&#8217;t be too much of an issue.</p>
<h2>Andrew Noble, partner, Par Equity</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Strong in fintech, health tech, data science, deep tech. Excited by quantum computing, advanced materials, AI in Edinburgh. Weak in blockchain and consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?</strong><br />
Current Health, InfraCost, Speech Graphics and Cyan Forensics.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Good at seed stage up to £1 million, okay for pre-series A (£1 million to £3 million) and non-existent for Series A (£3 million-£10 million). Quality of investors is improving. Par Equity is leading the way.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Experiencing influx of new talent due to COVID-19. Edinburgh is a highly desirable city to live in. Recent new residents include Aaron Ross (Predictable Revenue) and Jules Pursuad (early employee at Airbnb and now VP at Omio).</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Par Equity (investor), Paul Atkinson, Alistair Forbes, Mark Logan, Lesley Eccles, Chris McCann, CodeBase.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
One to two new unicorns. Promising number of high-growth tech companies. A much more sophisticated investor scene in the Series A space.</p>
<h2>Danae Shell, co-founder and CEO, Valla</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Edinburgh is strong in fintech because of our proximity to so many financial services companies and banks. Also, there are some exciting games tech companies because of our history of games companies. We&#8217;re pretty weak in law tech, Valla&#8217;s area.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?</strong><br />
Vistalworks for consumer tech; Sustainably for fintech; Reath for sustainable tech.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
As a rule, Scottish investors are pretty conservative and risk-averse. The only real exception is Techstart Ventures, in my experience.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
I think more people will come to Edinburgh from London because the quality of life and cost of living are both so much better here.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Calum Forsyth and Mark Hogarth at Techstart Ventures; Janine Matheson at CodeBase; Jackie Waring from the Investing Women angel syndicate; Jim Newbury is a very well-respected developer and coach, and my co-founder Kate Ho is also well known. Also Danny Helson who runs the EIE event with the Bayes Centre.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
We&#8217;ve had a few exits in the past few years (Skyscanner, FreeAgent), which means that talent is spreading out across the ecosystem here and we&#8217;re getting some fantastic new startups kicking off. In five years, that first crop should be coming into the Series A stage so we could see a lot of super exciting businesses!</p>
<h2>Allan Nelson, co-founder and CEO, For-Sight</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Strong in fintech, travel tech, health, oil, renewables, e-commerce, gaming (both video game and gambling tech). Excited by all bar oil (great driver of revenue, but not the future).</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?</strong><br />
Boundary, Parsley Box, Appointedd, Criton, Mallzee, TravelNest, TVSquared, Care Sourcer, Stampede, For-Sight.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Big fintech scene here. Travel tech is growing too, with Skyscanner&#8217;s influence strong.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Most will stay, as it&#8217;s a very attractive city to live and work in. It&#8217;s a globally recognized and unique city. Very international flavor as evidenced by the makeup of our team.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Ex-Skyscanner people including Gareth Williams, Mark Logan, etc. Ian Ritchie, Alistair Forbes, the FanDuel&#8217;s founders and the CodeBase founders.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
A lot bigger, as tech is a key growth target of the Scottish government and is underpinned/influenced/inspired by Skyscanner and FanDuel.</p>
<h2>Lysimachos Zografos, founder, Parkure</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Strong in machine learning/AI/digital. Weak in deep tech discovery, especially in biotech/therapeutics. Excited by the rise in adoption of AI in drug discovery — all these ideas that were sci-fi 20 years ago are now adopted in £B deals.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?</strong><br />
Pheno Therapeutics.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Conservative angels and a few tech seed VCs.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Move in.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Investors: Archangels, Techstart Ventures and Epidarex.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Growing.</p>
<h2>Bertie Wilson, co-founder, “Stealth mode”</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is your tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t think there are any sectors that stand out — it&#8217;s fairly evenly split. A good strength of the city is the talent that comes from the universities. There are some really good engineers that come from Edinburgh, Heriot Watt and Edinburgh Napier. The main weakness is that the ecosystem doesn&#8217;t favor the most ambitious founders. Most investors in the region are angels and aren&#8217;t interested in finding outliers that could grow 1000x and are more interested in backing companies that are less risky but might 5x their money. If you want to find investors that will back risky (but very ambitious) plans, it&#8217;s easier to find that elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Edinburgh?</strong><br />
Desana, Continuum Industries, Parsley Box, Current Health, Boundary, Zumo.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Edinburgh? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
I would say it&#8217;s getting better, but there are still a lot of issues with the ecosystem. It is being helped in Scotland by the likes of Techstart investing at the earliest stages with high conviction and term sheets that are more similar to London VCs. Outside of this, though, it&#8217;s easy for founders to end up with a messy cap table due to the number of angels and lack of VCs looking for VC-type returns — the messiness of these cap tables can then make it hard to raise venture funding down the line. This is fine for a lot of companies that aren&#8217;t aiming for a venture-scale return (which admittedly is a lot), but it can hurt those that are.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Edinburgh, or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
I imagine and hope others will move in. It is a great place to live with a very high quality of life, and this should be a natural attraction for people who want a good standard of living but want to remain in a city.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
SEP (investor), Techstart Ventures (investor), Gareth Williams (founder/investor), MBM Commercial (lawyers), Pentech, Bill Dobbie (investor), Jamie Coleman.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Optimistically, I hope that there will be a good number of companies that are at the Series B/Series C stage, which will invite a lot more interest from investors outside of Edinburgh (London, Berlin, Paris, New York, San Francisco, etc.) to start investing more actively in the city at the earliest stages as well as these stages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alibaba&#8217;s cloud computing unit is making its <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/apsara-stack">Apsara operating system</a> compatible with processors based on Arm, x86, RISC-V, among other architectures, the company announced at a conference on Friday.</p>
<p>Alibaba Cloud is one of the fastest-growing businesses for the Chinese e-commerce giant and the world&#8217;s fourth-largest public cloud service in the second half of 2020, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47685521">according to market research firm IDC</a>.</p>
<p>The global chip market has mostly been dominated by Intel&#8217;s x86 in personal computing and Arm for mobile devices. But RISC-V, an open-source chip architecture competitive with Arm&#8217;s technologies, is gaining popularity around the world, especially with Chinese developers. Started by academics at the University of California, Berkeley, RISC-V is open to all to use without licensing or patent fees and is generally not subject to America&#8217;s export controls.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Trump Administration&#8217;s bans <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/huawei-uncertainties-new-us-chip-rules-tsmc/">on Huawei</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/trump-adds-another-year-to-huawei-zte-ban/">rival ZTE</a> over national security concerns have effectively severed ties between the Chinese telecom titans and American tech companies, including major semiconductor suppliers.</p>
<p>Arm was forced to decide its relationships with Huawei and said it<a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3127782/british-chip-design-firm-arm-takes-aim-intel-biggest-tech-overhaul"> could continue licensing to the Chinese firm</a> as it&#8217;s of U.K. origin. But Huawei still struggles to find fabs that are both capable and allowed to actually manufacture the chips designed using the architecture.</p>
<p>The U.S. sanctions led to a burst in activity around RISC-V in China&#8217;s tech industry as developers prepare for future tech restrictions by the U.S., with Alibaba at the forefront of the movement. Alibaba Cloud, Huawei and ZTE are among the 13 premier members of <a href="https://riscv.org/members/">RISC-V International</a>, which means they get a seat on its Board of Directors and Technical Steering Community.</p>
<p>In 2019, the e-commerce company&#8217;s semiconductor division T-Head launched its first core processor Xuantie 910, which is based on RISC-V and used for cloud edge and IoT applications. Having its operating system work with multiple chip systems instead of one mainstream architecture could prepare Alibaba Cloud well for a future of chip independence in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IT ecosystem was traditionally defined by chips, but cloud computing fundamentally changed that,&#8221; Zhang Jianfeng, president of Alibaba Cloud&#8217;s Intelligence group, said at the event. &#8220;A cloud operating system can standardize the computing power of server chips, special-purpose chips and other hardware, so whether the chip is based on x86, Arm, RISC-V or a hardware accelerator, the cloud computing offerings for customers are standardized and of high-quality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some argue that Chinese companies moving towards alternatives like RISC-V means more polarization of technology and standards, which is not ideal for global collaboration unless RISC-V becomes widely adopted in the rest of the world.</p>
