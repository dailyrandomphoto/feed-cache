										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s that time of year again. Summer is winding down, the leaves are starting to change color and Apple’s getting ready to drop a brand new iPhone on the world. Today’s big event arrives less than a year after the last big iPhone event, as Apple seems to be back on schedule, after some early pandemic supply chain issues.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/what-we-expect-from-next-weeks-apple-event/">a handy roundup</a> of all the things we expect to see live on video from Cupertino, based on a slew of rumors and leaks. The big news today is almost certainly the arrival of the iPhone 13. We’re also expecting the new Apple Watch Series 7 to drop, as well as some other key hardware additions, potentially including new AirPods and additional Apple Silicon Mac models.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you&#8217;re hot, you&#8217;re hot. And 1047 Games is making the most of the heat generated by <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/play-now"><em>Splitgate</em></a>, its first game and a now a breakout success. After working on a shoestring for years, the team has since May raised <em>three</em> rounds, the latest for a massive $100M.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Ian Proulx credited a dedicated community and, as he described it, &#8220;taking a Silicon Valley approach to running a game business.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time 1047 Games was founded, about 5 years ago, free to play (f2p) PC games were a niche genre. While games like <em>World of Tanks</em> and <em>Warframe</em> were seeing success, and of course many mobile games relying on in-app-purchases, <em>Fortnite</em> had yet to show the industry that f2p could be so ludicrously profitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;5 years ago it was very hit driven: you spend years developing a product, put all this money into hyping the launch, and then hope it&#8217;s a success,&#8221; Proulx explained. &#8220;Our process was, there&#8217;s no way we can take that risk — if we spent our entire budget and got it wrong, we&#8217;re out of business. So we thought, let&#8217;s do a soft launch, put it out there and see what happens, learn, listen, look at the data. Why would I spend money marketing a product that I have no idea about whether it will be a success? If we wanted to spend money, and we didn&#8217;t have a lot, I&#8217;d rather spend it on a product that has great metrics and KPIs.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with it, <em>Splitgate</em> is a multiplayer online competitive shooter with a lot of DNA from the old-school arena shooters like <em>Quake 3</em>, <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, and <em>Halo</em>. Those games are frenetic enough, but <em>Splitgate</em> adds the ability to bend space with portals, like the eponymous <em>Portal</em>, adding a truly ridiculous amount of mobility to the action.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201709" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201709" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2201709" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png" alt="Screenshot of the game Splitgate showing a player aiming through a portal" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/splitgate.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2201709" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> 1047 Games</p></div></p>
<p>Proulx said investors shut the door on him repeatedly because they didn&#8217;t see <em>Splitgate</em> competing in any of the popular genres, battle royales and hero shooters, for instance. But he felt confident that this update to a familiar formula would be a success partly because the demand was there, just sleeping. &#8220;People grew up playing these games, and the reason [the market] is dead is not because they stopped loving them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No one has moved the needle because there hasn&#8217;t been a lot of innovation, and there hasn&#8217;t been something that&#8217;s accessible to the masses. <em>Quake Arena</em> is great, but it&#8217;s extremely difficult. No 12-year-old <em>Fortnite</em> kid is gonna play it. We really do fill this void.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While gameplay-wise <em>Splitgate</em> is most obviously similar to classic shooters, Proulx said a better comparison would be <em>Rocket League</em>, another huge success story in gaming that took a great concept and provided it as cheaply as possible, making money off cosmetic items and other totally optional perks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can just have fun, turn your brain off and play, but there&#8217;s this limitless skill ceiling,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t spring fully-formed from 1047 in 2019, though. The team put out the gaming equivalent of a minimum viable product. &#8220;It was fun, and the basics were there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but we learned there&#8217;s way more to running a business and free-to-play than just having a fun game.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5XKcTM_NM8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The danger for any game is simply that people stop playing, so the team focused on retention and on listening to feedback from the community to make <em>Splitgate</em> a &#8220;forever game&#8221; that can go years with &#8220;seasons,&#8221; new features and maps, and so on.</p>
<p>The original MVP release saw some traction, around 600,000 downloads in its first month, but the big multi-platform relaunch — still as an &#8220;open beta&#8221; — this summer made a huge splash, pulling in more than 10 <em>million</em> in July.</p>
<p>Suddenly the tables had turned and 1047 was holding, as Proulx put it, &#8220;lightning in a bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first round six months ago was extremely difficult. We talked to every investors on the planet and they all said no,&#8221; he recalled. But the hard work paid off: &#8220;We got lucky and ended up with the perfect partners — I can&#8217;t stress enough how supportive our investors have been.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next round ( with Human Capital, just as <em>Splitgate</em> was taking off, went from phonecall to funding over a weekend. This third round, with 1047 picking and choosing, was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from &#8220;Insight Partners, Anthos Capital, and earlier seed round investors Galaxy Interactive, VGames, Human Capital, Lakestar, DraperDragon, and Draper University&#8221; (from the press release).</p>
<p>One wonders what a team of fewer than ten people could possibly do with $100M ($116M if you count the two previous rounds). But the bet investors are making is not that 1047 is going to suddenly make<em> Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em>, but rather that they think ten million (and rising) people playing a unique game is potentially a huge opportunity — <em>if</em> the developers have the chance to follow through. This post-hype period is the valley of death for many games, the developers starved for cash after streamers and curious casuals move on. But the funding means that, for 1047, it&#8217;s license to hire like mad and double down.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scope of what we can do is now through the roof,&#8221; said Proulx. &#8220;There&#8217;s so much we couldn&#8217;t think about because we were a tiny team with a tiny budget, but now everything is on the table. We&#8217;re focusing on the long term — I look at the game as being 25 percent done. We don&#8217;t need to be Fortnite tomorrow, but now it really is about building the next Riot Games, the next big games business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, <em>Splitgate</em> itself is still on the road to 1.0 and Proulx says the team can now truly focus on making it the game they and the community have been shaping it to be for years. He noted that many players have stuck by the team for years and helped make the game what it is, and that their input is just as important now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We read everything, we&#8217;re listening — keep the feedback coming. We&#8217;re still operating like the indie team that had to stay close with our community. We&#8217;re still in that mindset,&#8221; Proulx said, &#8220;but now we just have a ridiculous amount of money.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a>, the popular auto editing tool, announced the release of Grammarly for Developers today. The company is starting this effort with the Text Editor SDK (software development kit), which enables programmers to embed Grammarly text editing functionality into any web application.</p>
<p>Rob Brazier, head of product and platform at Grammarly, says that the beta release of this SDK gives developers access to the full power of Grammarly automated editing with a couple of lines of code.&#8221;Literally in just a couple lines of HTML, [developers] can add Grammarly&#8217;s assistance to their application, and they get a native Grammarly experiences available to all of their users without the users needing to install or register Grammarly,&#8221; Brazier told me.</p>
<p>Underneath the hood, these developers are getting access to highly sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) technology without requiring any artificial intelligence understanding or experience whatsoever. Instead, developers can take advantage of the work that Grammarly has already done.</p>
<p>While users of the target application don&#8217;t need to be Grammarly customers (and that is in fact the idea), if they do happen to be, they can log into their Grammarly accounts and access all of the functionality that comes with that. &#8220;If their users have a Grammarly subscription, those users can link their Grammarly accounts into the developer&#8217;s application. They can sign in with Grammarly and unlock the additional features of their particular subscriptions [directly] in that application,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Brazier said that because this is a starting point, the company wanted to keep it basic, get feedback on the beta and then add additional capabilities in the future. &#8220;We wanted to start with the simplest possible way of giving access to this capability to the greatest number of users. So that&#8217;s why we started with a pretty simple product. I think it&#8217;ll evolve over time and grow in sophistication, but it is really just a couple lines of code and you&#8217;re up and running,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is the company&#8217;s first dip into the developer tool space, allowing programmers to access Grammarly functionality and embed it in their applications. This is not unlike the approach Zoom took last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/">when it released an SDK</a> to tap into video services (although Zoom is much further along <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/will-zoom-apps-be-the-next-hot-startup-platform/">on this developer tool journey</a>). As companies like Grammarly and Zoom grow in popularity, it seems the next logical step is to expose the strengths of the platform, in this case text editing, to let developers take advantage of it. In fact, Salesforce was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/22/how-salesforce-paved-the-way-for-the-saas-platform-approach/">the first to implement this idea</a> in 2007 when it launched Force.com.</p>
<p>This approach also will potentially provide another source of revenue for Grammarly beyond the subscription versions of the product, although Brazier says it&#8217;s too early to say what shape that will take. Regardless, today&#8217;s announcement is just the first step in a broader strategy to expose different parts of the platform to developers and enable them to take advantage of all the work Grammarly&#8217;s engineers put into the platform. Interested developers <a href="https://developer.grammarly.com/">can apply</a> to be part of the beta program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://millions.co">Millions.co</a>, a social commerce platform geared towards professional and semi-professional athletes wanting help to monetize their fanbase by selling merch and/or on-demand video, has grabbed $10 million in funding led by Boston-based Volition Capital.</p>
<p>The round is being loosely pegged as a Series A as the seasoned team behind Millions self-funded the first wave of development to get the platform launched.</p>
<p>The founding team includes CEO Matt Whitteker, a boxing gym owner who co-founded the supply chain data management unicorn Assent Compliance and NoNotes.com; CMO Brandon Austin, co-founder of Go-Fish Cam; and, in advisor roles, Adrian Salamunovic, co-founder of DNA 11 and CanvasPop; Scott Whitteker (Fight For The Cure) and Bruce Buffer (a veteran sports announcer).</p>
<p><a href="https://millions.co">Millions</a>&#8216; launched its fan engagement social commerce platform in April &#8212; with an initial three products for pro/semi-pro athletes to pitch at their followers: Namely custom merchandize (including a free design service); ask-me-anything personalized videos; and a pay-per-view streaming offering that lets fans pay to tune into a live stream of their favorite sportsperson.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s initial plan had been to build just an e<span style="font-weight: 400;">commerce and merchandising platform but, having built that component, Salamunovic says the team decided to bundle in video products &#8212; such as personalized videos and &#8220;&#8216;democratiszing&#8217; pay-per-view (PPV). </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our biggest advantage and differentiator is that we are strictly focused on the sports world and fan engagement,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The obvious indirect competitors are Twitch (heavily focused on e-sports/gaming), Patreon (focused on creators), Represent.com (focused on merch drops for &#8216;influencers&#8217;), and even Onlyfans (we know who they focus on) but we’re laser focused on the multi-billion dollar sports market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cameo has a very similar product to our video &#8216;Ask Me Anything&#8217; platform &#8212; but we don’t focus on birthday shout outs we focus on allowing fans to ask their favorite athletes questions around their training, their success, predictions (we’ve seen a lot of gamblers use our platform to get tips) and less on things like Shoutouts,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We love <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/">Cameo</a>, but we’re really different and focused on sports.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cameo raises $50M to deliver personalized messages from celebrities &#038; influencers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/embed/#?secret=MY6s9teGIf" data-secret="MY6s9teGIf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook are all great social media platforms that allow athletes to engage and interact with their fans but it’s not a great place to monetize your audience,&#8221; Salamunovic also argues. &#8220;We help athletes create a brand, build a merch line, sell video content (Personalized videos and watch parties all on a single platform). We’re not trying to replace any of these platforms, we’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complementing them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by allowing the athletes to provide a single link and landing page for deeper interaction and monetization. The fans seem to love it too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>At this stage, Millions only has around 300 athlete profiles live but says it has &#8220;thousands&#8221; who&#8217;ve registered interest across a variety of sports categories.</p>
<p>Its first focus &#8212; including for partnerships with agencies and sports leagues &#8212; has been on &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">combat sports and gyms&#8221;. But the platform has a long list of sports types in the search filter &#8212; from lacrosse to water polo to baseball or gymnastics &#8212; so the ambition is to go after a very broad funnel of pro/semi sportspeople. </span></p>
<p>And for every Michael Jordan or Cristiano Ronaldo &#8212; aka, those top tier athletes who can command hundreds of millions in sponsorship fees by inking partnerships with top brands to promote their products and who you certainly won&#8217;t find selling hats on Millions &#8212; there are scores of athletes who aren&#8217;t able to cut such sweet deals and who will have far more modest fanbases.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that broad field of players and performers who Millions hopes will flock to its platform &#8212; and take up its dedicated offer of social commerce tools and tech to engage with and monetize their followers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commenting on the funding in a statement, Sean Cantwell, managing partner at Volition Capital, suggested: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Athletes are always looking for ways to connect on a deeper level with fans, generate additional revenue streams and build their personal brands and Millions offers all of this on a single platform. We think that Millions is the future of fan engagement.”</span></p>
<p>To help grease the funnel of sportspeople it needs to drive eyeballs to its platform, Millions is offering athletes a &#8220;signing bonus&#8221; when they join and start selling &#8212; with a variety of tiers of bonus (of up to $5k) per sportsperson.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We initially wanted to stay hyper-focused on combat sports and not try to &#8216;boil the ocean&#8217;. Now we’re releasing new athletes profiles daily and introducing new sports like football, volleyball, golf and more,&#8221; notes Salamunovic. &#8220;Really, this platform is designed for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">any athlete</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who wants to reach their fans and create new monetization channels without having to put a ton of effort into things like page design, technology, design or logistics&#8230; we take care of all that so they can focus on engaging with their fans and most importantly on their sport and training.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re looking to build the most important sports tech company in history,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We’re going to be the Etsy (21B market cap) of sports. That’s an ambitious statement but it&#8217;s true. 98% of athletes NEED our product/platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Chasing that scale is why Millions is raising now<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> And while the early focus has been on North America &#8212; where about 90% of the onboarded sportspeople hail from currently &#8212; it reckons there&#8217;s &#8220;huge growth potential&#8221; in Europe and Asia so is very much gunning to build a global business.</p>
<p>It says it&#8217;ll be splashing Series A cash on growing its<span style="font-weight: 400;"> product engineering team and recruiting to expand its team generally, as well as spending on marketing to get the word out to athletes and get more signed up to build their own brands and sell direct to fans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe a powerful thing we’re doing, past just the product offering, is enabling athletes to have a team,&#8221; adds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Austin. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Millions, athletes get a marketing team, a personal account manager, and a design team that they can use to build their brand and product line, and to promote to, and further build, their fan base. We allow the athlete to focus on training, playing/fighting, and winning while we help take care of everything else, and coach them on how to brand and market themselves.” </span></p>
<p>Millions&#8217; business model is to take a 20% cut of all sales athletes make via the platform &#8212; with the split remaining the same for merchandise or video sales.</p>
<p>For the former, Millions is using a global network of print-on-demand suppliers to do the fulfilment.</p>
<p>While products the platform can customize for athletes to sell as their own brand merch include t-shirts, caps and hoodies.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Sonos has sold home theater products for a long time, but the company has made the living room even more of a priority in recent years. It started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-sonos-beam-review.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">with the Sonos Beam</a>, a smaller and more affordable version of the flagship Playbar soundbar. And 2020’s new flagship, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">the Sonos Arc</a>, was the company’s first soundbar capable of Dolby Atmos playback.</p>
<p>Today, the <a href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Beam" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Beam</a> is getting a major upgrade. The new, second-generation Beam goes <a href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:on sale today" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">on sale today</a> for $449 and will be available on October 5th. That’s $50 more than before, in line with the other price increases Sonos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-raising-prices-september-12-174153206.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">announced last week</a>. The good news is that the new Beam is more capable than its predecessor in a number of ways. We’ll have to review it before we can really say if it’s worth the extra $50, but there are a number of notable new features here.</p>
<p>The new Beam looks nearly identical to its predecessor, aside from a new perforated polycarbonate grille instead of the cloth front found on the original. It also has the same speaker components inside: a center tweeter, four woofers, and three passive bass radiators. What’s different is that the new processor inside the Beam is 40 percent faster, which opens up a lot of new audio formats.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-09%2F19eb6d30-14dd-11ec-bac3-6ed10307fd94&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=c93fb3944e4b3527e8719b229be3cf831e0c1e59" alt="Sonos Beam (gen 2)" data-uuid="a6ea4fed-59ef-32d4-8695-c67c838ae170" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div>
</figure>
<p>Most notably, the gen-two Beam supports Dolby Atmos, for movies, TV and music (the latter in a limited fashion, for now). Scott Fink, a product manager at Sonos who worked on the new Beam, says that the horsepower from the new CPU let the company increase the speaker arrays — not the specific speaker components, but, as Fink explains, “the set of software that coordinates the playback and interaction of all the speakers together in the soundbar.” The new Beam has five arrays, up from the three in the older model, and Fink said that the extras are dedicated to surround sound and height info.</p>
<p>All told, the Beam supports the same home theater audio formats <a href="https://support.sonos.com/s/article/4945?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="0">as the Arc</a>(including Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, Multichannel PCM and more), which costs twice as much as the Beam. In addition to the increased processing power, the new Beam has HDMI eARC to facilitate these new formats. Sonos says the speaker should have improved dialog clarity thanks to the additional audio processing power, something that should make the currently-available speech enhancement feature work better than before.</p>
<p>The hardware also supports additional music formats, as well. The Beam (as well as the Arc) will soon support the Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos formats from Amazon Music. Some Sonos speakers have worked with a handful of HD music services for a while now, but this is the first time that a 3D music format will work with the company’s products. I asked if there were any plans to support Dolby Atmos on Apple Music, and unsurprisingly the company wasn’t willing to say yet. But, there shouldn’t be any technical reason, it’s just a matter of Sonos and Apple working together to get more Apple Music formats supported.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-09%2F5e258d50-14dd-11ec-bbbb-043e27acfed2&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=9333b785a2447bfed0858373f29fb25254a1845d" alt="Sonos Beam (gen 2)" data-uuid="25c287ff-9baa-30f6-a9a4-eb241cd92d3b" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div>
</figure>
<p>As with other Sonos products, the new Beam connects to the company’s other speakers for multi-room playback; you can also use other Sonos speakers as surrounds. You can tune the speaker to your room to improve the sound using Trueplay, assuming you have an iOS device. The Beam also has far-field microphones so it can receive voice commands through either Alexa or the Google Assistant, but that’s not required (there’s a mic mute button right on top of the Beam, too). Like some other recent Sonos speakers, the new Beam has NFC to make setup even easier — playing your phone running the Sonos app near it will automatically connect it to your WiFi network.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based on what Sonos has said so far, the <a href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:new Beam" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">new Beam</a> is probably not a crucial upgrade for most, unless you’ve been itching to get Dolby Atmos into your setup without spending a ton of money. But given that the Beam is already the best-selling compact soundbar (according to NPD data), these upgrades should help it keep its lead over the competition — even with that $50 price hike.</p>

The device won&#8217;t only be capable of taking photos, but also of displaying messages and notifications, making calls, providing navigation and translating text right in real time in front of your eyes. Like Facebook, Xiaomi is also putting emphasis on the device&#8217;s lightness despite its features. At 51 grams, though, it&#8217;s a bit heavier than the social network&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">Ray-Ban Stories</a>. In addition, the glasses also has an indicator light that shows when the 5-megapixel camera is in use.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I9bnmES7O74?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s Smart Glasses are powered by a quad-core ARM processor and run on Android. They also use MicroLED imaging technology, which is known for having a higher brightness and longer lifespan than OLED. The company says the technology has a simpler structure that enabled it to create a compact display with individual pixels sized at 4μm. You won&#8217;t be able to view the images you take in color, though — Xiaomi says it opted to use a monochrome display solution &#8220;to allow sufficient light to pass through complicated optical structures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The grating structure etched onto the inner surface of the lens allows light to be refracted in a unique way, directing it safely into the human eye. The refraction process involves bouncing light beams countless times, allowing the human eye to see a complete image, and greatly increasing usability while wearing. All this is done inside a single lens, instead of using complicated multiples lens systems, mirrors, or half mirrors as some other products do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Its smart glasses won&#8217;t be just a second screen for your phone, according to Xiaomi. It&#8217;s independently capable of many things, such as selecting the most important notifications to show you, including smart home alarms and messages from important contacts. The device&#8217;s navigation capability can display maps and directions in front of your eyes. It can also show you the number of whoever&#8217;s currently calling your phone, and you can take the call using the smart glasses&#8217; built in mic and speakers.</p>
<p>That mic will be able to pick up speech, as well, which Xiaomi&#8217;s proprietary translating algorithm can translate in real time. The glasses&#8217; translation feature also works&#8217; on written text and text on photos captures through its camera. Unfortunately, the company has yet to announce a price or a launch date for the glasses, but we&#8217;ll keep you updated when it does.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[What would you pay for $1 of BNPL GMV?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a two-Exchange Tuesday, everyone. First up, we&#8217;re talking fintech valuations. Next up, we&#8217;re digging into Atlanta.</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s news that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/">PayPal intends to buy Japanese startup Paidy</a> marked the second major acquisition of a buy now, pay later (BNPL) company this year. PayPal&#8217;s news followed an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">even larger deal by Square for the Australian BNPL company Afterpay</a>.</p>
<p>The multibillion-dollar exits provided hard market proof that what BNPL startups are building has value beyond simple operating results; major fintech platforms are willing to shell out large sums for their revenues and possible strategic value.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Because both deals happened in 2021, they provide two data points for the value of BNPL companies operating at scale. And because both Square and PayPal provided some information to their investors concerning their transactions, we have a little bit of comparative work to do.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do a little math and figure out how much PayPal and Square investors are paying for transaction volume across both platforms. Then, we&#8217;ll peek at what Affirm is worth along similar lines. We&#8217;ll wrap with a look at Klarna&#8217;s numbers to see if there&#8217;s anything we can dig up there.</p>

<h2>What would you pay for $1 of BNPL GMV?</h2>
<p>Square&#8217;s Afterpay deal is worth some $29 billion, a huge sum. It isn&#8217;t hard to see why the U.S. consumer- and business-focused fintech is willing to write so large a check &#8212; Afterpay does <em>volume</em>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[EverAfter's customer-facing tool streamlines onboarding and retention and enables B2B clients to embed personalized customer portals within any product.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://everafter.ai/">EverAfter</a> secured $13 million in seed funding to continue developing its no-code customer-facing tool that streamlines onboarding and retention and enables business-to-business clients to embed personalized customer portals within any product.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-based company was founded in 2020 by Noa Danon and Tal Shemesh. CEO Danon, who comes from a project management background, said they saw a disconnect between the user and product experience.</p>
<p>The company’s name, EverAfter, comes from the concept that in SaaS companies, someone has to be in charge of the “EverAfter,” with customers, even as the relationship changes, Danon told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Via its no-code platform, customer success teams are able to build a website in weeks using drop-and-drag widgets like training materials, timelines, task management and meeting summaries, and then configure what each user sees. Then there is a snippet of code that is embedded into the product.</p>
<p>EverAfter also integrates with existing customer relationship management, project management and service ticket tools, while also updating Salesforce and HubSpot directly through an interface.</p>
<p>“It’s like the customer owns a piece of real estate inside the product,” Danon said.</p>
<p>TLV Partners and Vertex Ventures co-led the round and were joined by angel investors Benny Shneider, Zohar Gilon and Amit Gilon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yanai Oron, general partner at Vertex Ventures, said he is seeing best-in-breed companies try to solve customer churn or improve the relationship process on their own and failing, which speaks to the complexity of the problem.</p>
<p>Startups in this space are coming online and raising money, but with EverAfter, they are differentiating themselves by not only putting a dashboard on their product, but launching with the capabilities to manage thousands of customers using the product, he added.</p>
<p>“I’ve been tracking the customer success space over the past few years, and it is a growing field with the least sophisticated tools,” Oron said. “During COVID, companies realized it was easier to retain customers rather than get new ones. We are all used to more self-service and wanting to get the answer ourselves, and customers are the same. Companies also started to be more at ease in letting customers develop things on their own and leave R&amp;D departments to do other things.”</p>
<p>Clients include Taboola, AppsFlyer and Verbit, with Verbit reporting its company’s customer success managers save 10 hours a week managing ongoing customer communication by using EverAfter, Danon added. This comes as CallMiner reports that <a href="https://pages.callminer.com/US-CallMiner-Churn-Index-2020.html">unplanned customer churn</a> costs companies $35.3 billion in the U.S. alone.</p>
<p>EverAfter offers both customer success and partner management software and clients can choose a high-touch service or kits and templates for self-service.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to focus on integration and expansion into additional use cases. Since being founded, EverAfter has grown to 20 employees and 30 customers. The founders also want to utilize the data they are collecting on what works and doesn’t work for each customer.</p>
<p>“There are so many interesting things that happen between companies and customers, from onboarding to business reviews, and we are going to expand on those,” Danon said. “We want to be the first thing companies put inside their product to figure out the relationship between customers and customer success teams and managers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seems Locus Robotics is striking while the iron is hot. Seven months after raising <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/locus-robotics-has-raised-a-150m-series-e/">a sizable $150 million Series E</a>, Tiger Global is investing another $50 million in the Massachusetts firm. The last round made Locus a unicorn, and this one brings the company’s total funding to around $300 million.</p>
<p>Locus specializes in warehouse and fulfillment robotics, making a more modular solution that doesn’t require the sort of &#8220;ground-up build&#8221; of a Berkshire Grey. The company’s approach is closer to that of Fetch, which was acquired by Zebra Technologies back in July. Locus seems prime for an acquisition from a logistics firm or retailer grappling to compete with the monolith of Amazon.</p>
<p>The continued funding rounds, on the other hand, seem to point to a company looking to continue to go it alone.</p>

<hr />
<p>CEO Rick Faulk confirmed as much with me back in February, stating, “We have no interest in being acquired. We think we can build the most and greatest value by operating independently. There are investors that want to invest in helping everyone that’s not named ‘Amazon’ compete.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Faulk adds this morning that the new funds are a kind of validation for Locus. Certainly they’re yet another sign in accelerated interest in automation amid the pandemic. “At a time of increasing volumes and ongoing labor shortages, this new round of funding underscores how critical flexible, scalable, intelligent robotics automation has become to the warehouse and the supply chain,” the executive says. “Locus is uniquely positioned to drive digital transformation in this enormous global market.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Funding will be used to further expand Locus’ global operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s a new entrant in Southeast Asia’s growing list of unicorns. Jakarta-based <a href="https://www.xendit.co/en/">Xendit</a>, best known for its digital payment infrastructure but also focused on other financial products, announced today it has raised $150 million in Series C funding, bumping its valuation to $1 billion. The round was led by Tiger Global Management, with participation from returning investors Accel, Amasia and Goat Capital, the venture firm co-founded by former Y Combinator partner Justin Kan (in 2015, Xendit became the first Indonesian startup to participate in the accelerator program).</p>
<p>Accel led Xendit’s $64.6 million Series B, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/indonesia-payments-infra-startup-xendit-raises-64-6m/">announced just six months ago</a>. This new round brings its total funding so far to $238 million. The company was founded in 2015 by chief executive officer Moses Lu and chief operating officer Tessa Wijaya.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Xendit expanded into the Philippines, and says it is now one of the biggest payment players in the country. In July, it <a href="https://www.dragonpay.ph/dragonpay-announces-strategic-investment-from-xendit/">announced a strategic investment</a> in legacy online payments platform Dragonpay.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="V1TvqCpRiU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/indonesia-payments-infra-startup-xendit-raises-64-6m/">Indonesian payments infra startup Xendit raises $64.6M in Accel-led Series B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indonesian payments infra startup Xendit raises $64.6M in Accel-led Series B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/indonesia-payments-infra-startup-xendit-raises-64-6m/embed/#?secret=V1TvqCpRiU" data-secret="V1TvqCpRiU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Xendit decided to raise again because to fuel expansion into other countries, Wijaya told TechCrunch. “Our core focus at the moment for this new fundraise is to further regionalize and to expand our product suite in regions where we are at or will expand into.” The company also plans to launch value-added services.</p>
<p>Wijaya said that Xendit has experienced more than 200% year-over-year increase in total payments volume, and now has a total payment volume (TPV) of $9 billion processed per annum.</p>
<p>Before COVID-19, many of Xendit’s customers were in the travel industry, and it was hit hard by the pandemic. But since then, it’s expanded its scope.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“One big segment are SMEs. By August, there were 10,000 SME sign-ups on our platform alone. The other one is expanding out to fintech companies—for example, there’s been a big uptick in Indonesia, especially accounting platforms. We’ve also expanded to traditional enterprises, like telecom companies, who focused on having retail outlets in shopping malls. Suddenly the malls are closed, so we’ve been able to sign some of the bigger retail outlet groups in the market as well.”</p>
<p>The company’s clients range in size from SMEs to some of the region’s largest tech players, including Traveloka, Wise, Wish and Grab. Digital payments in most Southeast Asian markets are extremely fragmented, with consumers using everything from digital wallets, buy-now-pay-later services and virtual accounts to traditional debit and credit cards.</p>
<p>Xendit’s solutions let businesses accept payments from many of these methods through three integration options. These include live URLs that sellers can message to a customer for payment; web and mobile checkouts that work with e-commerce platform plug-ins; and APIs.</p>
<p>Though it is best known as a payment infrastructure provider, referring to itself as “a Stripe alternative build for Indonesia and Southeast Asia” <a href="https://www.xendit.co/en/stripe-in-indonesia/">on its website</a>, Xendit is also working on other services. “In Southeast Asia, you can’t just focus on one thing, you can’t just focus on payments,” said Wijaya. “You want to focus on being this platform for every merchant to get onboard, and to never leave whenever they transact digitally.”</p>
<p>For example, Xendit is experimenting with working capital loans for merchants, and also exploring credit card issuing with partners, since credit card penetration is still very low in Indonesia and the Philippines. “For merchants to come online, they don’t just need payments, they need to be able to do things like subscribe to Shopify or subscribe to Google Suite, to be able to support being digital-first.”</p>
<p>Xendit’s expansion strategy into new markets, like Malaysia and Vietnam, will rely on solving problems that are unique to each market. For example, Wijaya said disbursements, including marketplace refunds, were difficult in Indonesia, so Xendit focused on fixing that. In the Philippines, on the other hand, “the real problem was accepting money,” so Xendit developed direct debit with Grab.</p>
<p>“I think the formula we had in the Philippines, which is hiring a lot of local people who understand the market rather than telling them what to do, has really worked for us, and that is how we’re going to continue our expansion plan,” she said.</p>
<p>Some of Xendit’s competitors in its current markets include Midtrans in Indonesia, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/14/go-jek-buys-three-startups-to-advance-its-mobile-payment-business/">acquired by Gojek in 2017</a>, and PayMongo in the Philippines, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/27/philippines-payment-processing-startup-paymongo-lands-12-million-series-a-led-by-stripe/">backed by Stripe</a>.</p>

<p>Xendit’s edge is combining a global approach with its intense focus on localization, Wijaya said. “One of our investors sent a survey to some potential customers, big merchants, and they said what they like about Xendit is because we have a full commitment to being on the ground. We’re not like players where expanding into one market means a sales team, and that’s it. When we expand somewhere, we really mean we’re going to expand. We’re going to hire partnership people, a customer success team there. We’re going to hire a whole team on the ground.”</p>
<p>In a press statement, Tiger Global Management partner Alex Cook said, “Xendit’s digital payments infrastructure, built specifically for Southeast Asia, is quickly becoming the standard for financial operations in the region. By providing a reliable and secure payment gateway, Xendit has created an on-ramp to the digital economy for businesses across the region.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QED Investors announced the closing of two new funds totaling $1.05 billion, capital that it will be using to back early-stage startups, as well as growth rounds for later-stage companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, today </span><a href="https://www.qedinvestors.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QED</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is announcing a $550 million early-stage fund and a $500 million growth-stage fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both of which are aimed at backing fintech companies primarily in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Latin America and Southeast Asia. The fund was oversubscribed, according to QED co-founder and managing partner Nigel Morris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2007 founding by Morris &#8212; who also co-founded Capital One Financial Services in 1994 &#8212; and Frank Rotman, QED has backed more than 150 companies, including 20 unicorns. It currently has over $3 billion under management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While fintech has been an area of investor interest for some time, it’s safe to say the sector has exploded in recent years &#8212; largely fueled by consumer demand as more people transact online. That’s especially true as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to (sadly) rage on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, Alexandria, Virginia-based QED was investing in fintech before fintech was “cool.” As evidence of that, the firm led Credit Karma’s Series A in 2009; led Remitly’s Series A in 2014 and participated in Nubank’s Series A in 2014.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm has come a long way from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">when it closed its first fund &#8212; $30 million of internal capital &#8212; in 2008. Its last fund &#8212; totaling $400 million &#8212; closed in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, QED has backed unicorns that went on to exit either via the public markets or by acquisition, including SoFi, Credit Karma, Red Ventures and, more recently, Flywire.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who also years prior had launched Capital One Financial Services, it’s no surprise that when Morris started a venture fund, it was one that focused on funding fintech companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 14 years&#8230; it remains our cornerstone, even though fintech has evolved from the lending and credit businesses of the early years that was a core part of our Capital One DNA,” said Morris, who serves as QED’s managing partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Rotman, the firm’s founding partner, describes fintech as QED’s “North Star.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are so many exciting financial technology verticals today that can have a meaningful and lasting impact on consumers across the world, from proptech, sustainability and earned wage access to student loan solutions and financial products that cater to those that have been long ignored by banks and financial institutions,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Rotman said the firm is bullish on the future of embedded finance and on backing companies that distribute financial products in a variety of industries such as cross-border trucking logistics (such as Nuvocargo), car sales (Kavak) and shrimp farming (XpertSea).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QED plans to invest in between 40 to 50 companies out of its early-stage fund, with an initial average check size of $5 million to $15 million with similar reserves, according to Morris. The firm expects to make 20-25 investments out of its growth fund, with average check sizes between $10 million and $40 million. It has so far made one investment out of that growth fund, which has not yet been publicly announced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost every single” LP from QED Fund VI increased their allocation in the firm’s new funds, according to Morris. But the firm also welcomed several new LPs. While Morris declined to be more specific, he said the new LPs included “some really well-known names.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no better confirmation than when an LP doubles down in their support of what we’re doing,” Rotman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of strategy, Rotman notes that QED has continued to lead deals that it feels “passionate about being involved in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not a secret that the market’s hot, and opportunities move quickly in this type of environment,” he told TechCrunch. “We see firms meeting with a founder in the morning, and a term sheet issued as soon as the following day. Many VCs can offer capital. Very, very few can augment that with proven, actionable advice and insight that can help them tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Morris and Rotman believe the fact that QED&#8217;s 17-person investment team being made up of former operators gives it a competitive edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a unique company offering unique insights in an industry in which it’s easy to perform poorly and hard to do well,&#8221; Morris said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most fintech companies will fail. That&#8217;s just the statistical, pragmatic distribution that occurs,” he added.</span></p>
<p>Within the fintech industry, <span style="font-weight: 400;">there are myriad complicated issues &#8212; compliance, operations, tech, talent, credit risk and treasury, Morris continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And they take a long time for people to have enough tree rings to be able to understand them,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;Much of what we do&#8230;is help ameliorate and mitigate against those different issues by bringing to bear specific functional talent and the scars on our back of mistakes that we&#8217;ve made as operators to make sure that the young entrepreneur doesn&#8217;t make those same errors. It’s not enough to simply solve one problem. Founders need to successfully solve five, six, seven problems concurrently because if any one is not solved, the entire business will come crashing to the ground.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than six months after raising $75 million, </span><a href="https://www.pacaso.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacaso</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; a real estate platform which aims to help people buy and co-own a second home &#8212; announced today that it has raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the Series C funding round for Pacaso, which essentially went from “launch to unicorn” in five months earlier this year and is pronounced like Picasso. New backers Fifth Wall and Gaingels also participated in the financing, along with existing backers Greycroft, Global Founders Capital, Crosscut and 75 &amp; Sunny Ventures. (Sunny Ventures is Pacaso co-founder Spencer Rascoff’s venture firm). With the latest round, Pacaso has now raised a total of $215 million in equity funding since its 2020 inception. It also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">secured $1 billion in debt financing earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fully distributed startup launched its platform in October of last year and already has an annualized revenue run rate of $330 million, according to CEO and co-founder Austin Allison &#8212; a feat which quite frankly seems remarkable. The company currently manages nearly $200 million in real estate on its platform, and in the second quarter, its website and mobile app saw a combined 1.8 million visits, up 196% from the first quarter. It’s currently serving owners “in the hundreds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Zillow executives Allison and Rascoff came up with the concept of Pacaso after leaving Zillow together about two years ago. (Publicly traded Zillow today has a market cap of $24 billion.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a unique co-ownership model made possible via the creation of a property-specific LLC, the company aims to reduce the cost and hassle of second home ownership. It also gives vacation homeowners an alternative option to renting out their property.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/embed/#?secret=1AQ1btPGx8" data-secret="1AQ1btPGx8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacaso distinguishes its model from the age-old concept of timeshares, which sell the right to use a fixed amount of time in a condo or hotel. Pacaso aims to bring together a small group of co-owners to purchase a share of a single-family home and “enjoy ongoing access throughout the year.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way it works is that Pacaso purchases a home either outright or shares in a home. The company then partners with local real estate agents to market the properties. It then sells shares in the home — from one-eighth of the home to a greater percentage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacaso holds a brokerage license in about 25 top second home markets such as Napa, Lake Tahoe, Palm Springs, Malibu and Park City. It recently expanded to its first market outside of the U.S. &#8212; Spain. Buyers can view curated listings on the startup’s website, which includes active listings, as well as previews of homes under consideration for purchase based on buyer demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to curating the listings, Pacaso also offers integrated financing, “upscale” interior design, professional property management and proprietary scheduling technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January of this year, Pacaso had 30 employees. Today, it has over 120, according to Allison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that while Pacaso one day aspires to offer homes that are affordable to a broader segment of the population, Allison acknowledges that currently, the homes available on its platform are “very much” luxury, or higher price, homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for what markets it plans to enter next, he said that will be based on customer feedback. For now, Allison said, 65% of Pacaso’s customers are first-time second homeowners </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and 30% of are non-white or identify as LGBTQ.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Investing Partner </span><a href="https://visionfund.com/team/lydia-jett"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lydia Jett</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says she was drawn to Pacaso for both professional and personal reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one thing, she says that when she was growing up, her family owned one-tenth of a “modest” beach house on the coast of Oregon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is asset that should be an investment, and source of joy actually had an incredible amount of friction, pain and unexpected cost,” Jett told TechCrunch. “It was a difficult asset to make liquid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The friction and pain she referred to included debates around scheduling, capital investments and tension when one of the co-owners needed liquidity but none of the others wanted to buy them out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the pain involved many of the the things that Pacaso is trying to solve for, Jett believes. By managing the whole co-ownership process, owners don’t have to deal with the “headaches” of maintenance, furnishings and scheduling respective vacations, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve designed  a very innovative scheduling solution we call SmartStay, which empowers a calendar to be shared equitably among the ownership group so that each co-owner has fair and equitable access to the property all times of the year,” Allison told TechCrunch</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Pacaso is effectively an intermediary between the co-owners, something Jett makes it a very attractive model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, she said, SoftBank was drawn to the opportunity to “create a whole new category of home ownership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is something that fundamentally can enrich millions of people’s lives,” she told TechCrunch, “and help them realize that dream of co-ownership.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[SellersFunding created a lending and financial services platform to streamline global commerce for thousands of marketplaces, including working capital, cross-border cash management and taxes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sellersfunding.com/">SellersFunding</a> secured $166.5 million in a combination of Series A equity funding and a credit facility to continue developing its technology and payments platforms for e-commerce businesses.</p>
<p>Northzone led the round and was joined by Endeavor Catalyst and Fasanara. SellersFunding CEO Ricardo Pero did not disclose the funding breakdown, but did say the company previously raised two seed rounds for a total of $40 million in equity and more than $100 million in credit facilities, including one that the company was expanding to $200 million.</p>
<p>SellersFunding, with offices in Florida, New York and London, created a digital platform that delivers financial tools and resources to streamline global commerce for thousands of marketplaces, including working capital, cross-border cash management, tax solutions and business valuation.</p>
<p>Pero got the idea for the company after spending 20 years in the financial industry. He left JP Morgan in 2016 with a drive to start his own company. He was consulting for a friend selling on Amazon who asked him to help make sense of Amazon’s fees and to review the next year’s budget because the friend was struggling to keep up with growth.</p>
<p>“I helped him address the fees issue, but when I went to talk to traditional lenders, I found that they have no clue about e-commerce and the needs of SMEs,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition to being a lending source for businesses selling on these marketplaces, SellersFunding leverages sales data provided by the marketplaces and e-commerce platforms to create sales and cash flow estimates based on the credit limits given to clients so that owners can better understand the fees they are paying and make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>He founded the company in 2017, and today has over 30,000 registered users and is approaching $10 billion in sales volume that is feeding data into SellersFunding’s daily models. The company makes money as both a lender and on fees it charges for payments collected by its customers. Merchants can collect money from marketplaces and pay their suppliers in local or foreign currency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SellersFunding has consistently grown 300% year over year, Pero said. As such, he intends to use the new funding to scale globally, expand the team, create a marketing budget and look for two small acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>The company will continue to invest on the payments side and to promote cross-border payments.</p>
<p>“When I look at the payments landscape, companies are competing on pricing and I don’t think we will ever have a focus there, but instead will compete on customer experience,” Pero added. “Our core business will always be lending and our core investments will be payments and technology, but then we will extend to other services that our clients want.”</p>
<p>With an eye on expanding internationally, it fit to bring on Northzone as a partner, he added. The venture firm is based in Europe and was of a similar vision for thinking globally.</p>
<p>Jeppe Zink, general partner at Northzone, said via email that Pero and his team “are the most experienced in this category” and are building a category leader that is “more experienced and understanding of the lending side than its competitors.”</p>
<p>“We have seen this massive rise in e-shopping, most of the new ones coming from marketplaces like Amazon and Shopify, and if you look at the sellers, thousands are small businesses sourcing their goods which means that they are very important customers,” Zink added. “Normal banks like Barclay can&#8217;t check credit. SellersFinding is helping small businesses get this credit, and rightly so. In the same way we thought neobanks won with accounts created when it comes to delivering credit and banking products, they are nowhere to be found yet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Corporate gift services have come into their own during the Covid-19 pandemic by standing in as a proxy for other kinds of relationship building activities &#8212; office meetings, lunches, and hosting at events &#8212; that have traditionally been part and parcel of how people do business, but were no longer feasible during lockdowns, social distancing and offices closing their doors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, <a href="https://sendoso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendoso</a> &#8212; a popular &#8220;end-to-end&#8221; gifting platform offering access to 30,000 products including corporate swag, regular physical gifts, gift cards and more; and then providing services like logistics, packing and sending to get those gifts to the recipients &#8212; is announcing $100 million of funding to capitalize on this shift, led by a big new investor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New backer SoftBank, via its Vision Fund 2, is leading this latest Series C round of funding. Oak HC/FT, Struck Capital, Stage 2 Capital, Craft Ventures, Signia Venture Partners and Felicis Ventures &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/for-a-monthly-subscription-fee-this-startup-will-send-out-customized-gifts-to-current-and-prospective-clients-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all</a> previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/online-to-offline-platform-sendoso-raises-40m-after-growing-330-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors</a> &#8212; are also participating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company has been on a strong growth trajectory for years now, but it specifically saw a surge of activity as the pandemic kicked off. It now has more than 20,000 businesses signed up and using its services, particularly for sales and marketing outreach, but also to help shore up morale among employees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Everyone was stuck at home by themselves, saturated with emails,&#8221; said Kris Rudeegraap, the CEO of Sendoso, in an interview. &#8220;Having a personal connection to sales prospects, employees and others just meant more.&#8221; It has now racked up some 3 million gifts sent since launching in 2016.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sendoso is not disclosing its valuation, but Rudeegraap hinted that it was four times higher than the startup&#8217;s Series B valuation from 2020. PitchBook <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/171316-63/company/profile#comparisons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that to be $160 million, which would make the current valuation $640 million. The company has now raised over $150 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rudeegraap said Sendoso will be using the funds in part to invest in a couple of areas. First, to hire more talent: it has 500 employees now and plans to grow that by 30% by the end of this year. And second, international expansion: it is setting up a European HQ in Dublin, Ireland to complement its main office in San Francisco.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Comcast, Kimpton Hotels, Thomson Reuters, Nasdaq and eBay are among its current customers &#8212; so this is in part to serve those customers&#8217; global user bases, as well as to sign up new gifters. He estimated that the bigger market for corporate gifting is about $100 billion annually, so there is a lot to play for here.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company was co-founded by Rudeegraap and Braydan Young (who is its chief alliances officer) on the back of a specific need Rudeegraap identified while working as a sales executive. Gifting is a very standard practice in the world of sales and marketing, but he was finding a lot of traction with potential and current customers by taking a personalized approach to this act.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;I was manually packing boxes, grabbing swag, coming up with handwritten notes,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;It was inefficient, but it worked so well. So I dreamed up an idea: why not be able to click a button in Salesforce to do this automatically? Sometimes the best company is one that solves a pain point of your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this is essentially what Sendoso does. The startup&#8217;s platform integrates with a company&#8217;s existing marketing, sales and management software &#8212; Salesforce, HubSpot, SalesLoft <a href="https://sendoso.com/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among them</a> &#8212; and then lets users use this to organize and order gifts through these channels, for example as part of larger sales, marketing or HR strategies. The gifts are wide-ranging, covering corporate swag, other physical presents, gift cards and more, and there are also integrations you can include to share gifting across teams of salespeople, to analyze the campaigns and more.</p>
<p>The Sendoso platform itself, meanwhile, positions itself as having the &#8220;marketplace selection and logistics precision of Amazon.com.&#8221; But Sendoso also believes it&#8217;s better than someone simply using Amazon.com itself since it ultimately takes a more personalized approach in how it presents the gift.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of things we do uniquely in terms of what we have built throughout our software, gifting options and logistics centre. We really personalize our gifts at scale with handwritten notes, special boxing, and more,&#8221; something that Amazon cannot do, he added. &#8220;We have built a lot of unique technology and logistics software that would make it hard for Amazon to compete.&#8221; He said that one of Sendoso&#8217;s integrations is actually with Amazon, so Sendoso users can order through there, but then the gift is first routed to Sendoso to be repackaged in a nicer way before being sent out.</p>
<p>At its heart, the startup has built a way of knitting together disparate work practices &#8212; some codified in software, and some based on human interactions and significantly more infused with randomness, emotion and ad hoc approaches &#8212; and built it all into a technology platform. The ability to scale what feels like an otherwise bespoke level of service is what has helped Sendoso gain traction not just with users, but investors, too:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We believe Sendoso offers the most comprehensive end-to-end gifting platform in the market,” said Priya Saiprasad, a partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. &#8220;Their platform includes a global marketplace of curated vendors, seamless integration with existing tools, global logistics, and deep analytics. As a result, Sendoso serves as the backbone to enterprises’ engagement programs with prospective customers, existing customers, employees and other key stakeholders. We&#8217;re excited to lead this Series C round to help Sendoso accelerate its vision.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The funding raise comes as Immi releases a reformulation of their product this year aimed at replicating traditional instant ramen in broth taste, mouthfeel, texture and slurp ability.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://immieats.com/">Immi</a> is putting a healthy spin on instant ramen by going plant-based and offering more bold tastes. The company announced Tuesday that it raised $3.8 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Co-founders Kevin Lee and Kevin Chanthasiriphan both grew up in food families from Taiwan and Thailand, respectively, and met a decade ago while working at the same tech company. They bonded over getting noodles every day.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and they both saw family members stricken with diabetes and high blood pressure and started thinking about what a better-for-you food and beverage brand would look like.</p>
<p>Taking the love of the Asian food they grew up with, they wanted to develop one of those brands for the U.S.</p>
<p>“We immediately agreed on instant ramen,” Chanthasiriphan told TechCrunch. “My dad still eats instant ramen each night, and it is such a massive market: 4 billion packets are sold per year, but it is also a product that has been dominated by the same three incumbents for years.”</p>

<p>Their take on it is Immi, which is plant-based, low carb and low sodium, high fiber and has 22 grams of protein on average. The product comes in three flavors — Black Garlic “Chicken,” Tom Yum “Shrimp” and Spicy “Beef.”</p>
<p>The pair went into the company full-time in 2019 and have spent the better part of the last few years heads down in R&amp;D, but the finished product didn’t come easy. In fact, when speaking with people in the industry, they were told that creating a healthier version of ramen would be “kind of impossible,” Lee said. They had to start from the ground up and make it themselves, formulating the first recipes in their own kitchens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The funding raise comes as Immi releases a reformulation of their product this year aimed at replicating traditional instant ramen in broth taste, mouthfeel, texture and slurpability.</p>
<p>Siddhi Capital led the round and was joined by Palm Tree Crew, Constellation Capital, Animal Capital, Pear Ventures, Collaborative Fund and a group of individuals, including Patrick Schwarzenegger, Kat Cole and Nik Sharma, as well as executives from Thrive Market, Caviar, Daring Foods, Madhappy, Twitch, Kettle &amp; Fire, MUD\WTR, Native, Amity Supply, Visionary Music Group, Italic, Tatcha and Casper.</p>
<p>Melissa Facchina, co-founder and general partner at Siddhi Capital, said her firm invests in food and beverage brands and its investment arm is a mentor to the Immi team.</p>
<p>“We were blown away by them,” she said. “It costs a lot of money to innovate in this industry, and it is exciting for myself and family to have something that we can grab and go. The second version launching looks exactly like the traditional brick pack and now has adult flavors that attach to a different culinary pallet.”</p>
<p>The natural or better-for-you foods industry has changed “dramatically” in the last decade,  Facchina said. Most of it is driven by consumers that want transparency in the supply chain, cleaner ingredients and authentic brands.</p>
<p>Consumer packaged goods brands that are reinventing themselves already have successful product lines, but few brands are taking a look at certain categories she said are ripe for reinvention, like cereal. Her firm is an investor in Magic Spoon, and she sees Immi reinventing ramen and Asian cuisine, saying “the Kevins as a founder group are highly moldable, high-achieving and want to surround themselves with best-in-class people.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Back to School: Wide World of Ramen&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/19/back-to-school-wide-world-of-ramen/embed/#?secret=glGlVfKe3V" data-secret="glGlVfKe3V" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding will be split between R&amp;D, hiring and marketing, Lee said. The company is taking in customer feedback to enhance the flavors, and would like to optimize its supply chain, hire for key executive roles and put spending toward testing new marketing channels. Immi sells its product via its own online store, but would like to expand into wholesale channels and online grocers.</p>
<p>Immi’s products were launched in January and saw inventory sell out in the first month without any marketing. They have since sold over 10,000 orders across the U.S. and are even looking to go international.</p>
<p>Going forward, the company will be working on two initiatives: The first is to develop an infrastructure to expand its product offerings, like more flavors and noodle types, so it can launch a new flavor every few months. Lee and Chanthasiriphan also aim to develop additional Asian food products that have cleaner ingredients, like snacks and confections, that they loved eating when they were children.</p>
<p>The second is marketing and distribution. The company has amassed a community of 4,000 members that help Immi with rapid taste testing.</p>
<p>“We are figuring out how to bring our products to a more mainstream audience, especially those that may not be following a certain diet, but want to bring in food and beverages that are healthier,” Lee said. “We are also bringing in taste makers of culture, celebrities and TikTok influencers to broaden consumer interest and bring Immi into the mainstream cluster.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new lawsuit threatens a decades-long collaboration that brought Skype, robot delivery startup Starship Technologies and encrypted enterprise messaging service Wire into the world.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has learned that Mark Dyne, one of Skype&#8217;s founding investors, is suing billionaire Skype co-founder Janus Friis in California&#8217;s Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles for unlawful conspiracy in his business dealings.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is complex, with plenty of twists, turns and allegations. The heart of the dispute is whether Dyne and his partners, who had managed some of Friis&#8217;s investments, were working for — or simply with — the Skype co-founder when they organized a rescue package for Wire in 2019.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At stake is who gets to control Wire and the financial return each side gets from Starship. </span></p>
<p>Dyne and his investor partners accuse Friis of illegally replacing one of them as a director of a general partnership that manages Wire, and conspiring to reduce their interest in Starship Technologies. Dyne and his partners also allege (and dismiss) accusations by Friis that they had fiduciary duties to him when they found funding for and restructured Wire.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Friis] unfortunately believes he is always entitled to have what he wants, can force others to do what he wants, and can re-write history (and agreements) whenever it suits his present purpose,&#8221; reads the complaint, filed in July, but not previously reported.</p>
<h2>Founding stories</h2>
<p>Dyne was a key player in the history of Skype, as one of its original investors and its first board member. He remained on the board through its sale to eBay for more than $2.6 billion in 2005, and was part of the group that bought Skype from eBay in 2009. He was still on the board when it was eventually sold to Microsoft in 2011.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dyne and Friis worked together extensively in the years after Skype. Dyne was an investor and board member of Friis&#8217;s ill-fated music streaming service Rdio, which filed for bankruptcy in 2015. Like Friis, he also served as a director of the general partners of the Iconical investment funds that funded Wire to the tune of more than $64.5 million between 2013 and 2018, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Wire, launched by ex-Skype and Microsoft engineers, offers secure end-to-end encrypted messaging, file sharing, voice and video calls. Friis hoped Wire would become &#8220;the new Skype,&#8221; according to the lawsuit, but became disenchanted after it failed to scale quickly, and then pivoted to enterprise. Five years after its launch, Wire had acquired only about 150,000 users, all of whom were non-revenue generating, the lawsuit notes, and was burning through $8 to $10 million a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friis has a history of abandoning companies when they did not achieve their early objectives in his sole opinion,&#8221; the lawsuit reads. In addition, it states, Friis himself was highly involved with the design of the robots, the logo and the software app at Starship Technologies.</p>
<h2>A turning point</h2>
<p>At this point, the men were apparently still friends. They were working on a new venture referred to in the lawsuit only as &#8220;Project X,&#8221; and in 2017, Friis even donated $500,000 to Dyne&#8217;s charitable foundation.</p>
<p>In late 2018, the lawsuit says that Friis cut off the flow of cash from Wire&#8217;s loan facility and sent a text message to Dyne, reading: &#8220;Want to make sure we are ready to put everything into a Foundation if all else fails.&#8221; Wire would become free open source software, with the foundation responsible for setting terms for open source licenses. Friis envisioned himself, Wire&#8217;s CTO Alan Duric and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales sitting on its board.</p>
<p>But Dyne and his partners had a different idea. In early 2019, when Wire was only days away from shutting down, according to the lawsuit, Dyne and his partners quickly pulled together an $8 million Series A including them, Marbruck Investments and Wire&#8217;s own executive management team.</p>
<p>Friis told others that Dyne had &#8220;pulled off a miracle&#8221; in finding this financing, states the lawsuit. Although the Iconical funds would remain Wire&#8217;s single-largest shareholder, the transaction would, apparently, remove the company from Friis&#8217;s direct control.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says that following the round, Friis called Duric &#8220;a completely f**king disaster&#8221; and hastened to sever all ties with the company. It alleges he missed board meetings and did not speak to Morten Brøgger, Wire&#8217;s CEO, for nearly a year and a half.</p>
<p>That seems to have changed this year, following Wire&#8217;s $21 million Series B round. In May, Friis insisted that Wire be redomiciled in Germany, the lawsuit states: &#8220;In hindsight, this was clearly part of Friis&#8217;s undisclosed plan to reacquire control of Wire.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a Zoom (not Skype or Wire) call in October, says the lawsuit, Friis alleged that if the terms of the Wire transaction had been made clear to him and he had been properly advised, he would have never agreed to it, blaming Dyne and his partners. He also replaced one of them as a director and stalled meetings, it says.</p>
<h2>The fight over Starship</h2>
<p>Nor are Friis&#8217;s actions limited to Wire, according to the lawsuit. It says that Friis was always vexed that he did not have a controlling interest in the sidewalk robot delivery startup Starship, which was structured as a 50/50 deal with another Skype alumnus, Ahti Heinla. The lawsuit includes a screengrab of a text from Friis to Dyne suggesting if that structure could be remedied &#8220;in a way that was set in stone, one would easily pay [$]10-15 million for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that Friis conspired with one of his companies to inaccurately claim Starship as a &#8220;controlled portfolio company&#8221; of one of the Iconical funds. This would inflate his own interest in it at the expense of Dyne and his partners &#8220;to the point where [our] interest is no longer a financeable asset in the secondary markets,&#8221; it says. &#8220;Friis will say or do anything in order to suit his present fiction, no matter the cost to others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dyne did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Friis&#8217; legal team filed a motion to quash the lawsuit on Friday, on the grounds that Friis &#8212; a Danish citizen living in London &#8212; is not subject to the court&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The motion stated: &#8220;More than a decade ago, Dyne [and partner] recognized they could profit handsomely if they hitched their wagon to Friis. And over the ensuing years, while extracting millions of dollars&#8217; worth of fees and profit interests, they pretended they were acting as Friis&#8217;s and his entities&#8217; trusted fiduciaries overseeing and managing Friis&#8217;s various venture capital pursuits. But in reality&#8230; Plaintiffs had a single-minded focus of advancing their own commercial interests at the expense of Friis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friis&#8217;s lawyers also provided TechCrunch with the following statement: &#8220;Dyne&#8217;s defective lawsuit is a defensive reaction to questions raised regarding his and his team&#8217;s conduct&#8230; Although we believe that the allegations in the complaint are irresponsible, incomplete, and without merit, they also effectively concede that Dyne and his team breached fiduciary duties over their decade-plus relationship as trusted advisers. We look forward to fully addressing these matters in litigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outcome of this lawsuit, which is still in its early days, is likely to have little immediate impact on the operations of either Starship, which has made over 1.5 million autonomous deliveries and recently snagged ex-Google Loon chief Alastair Westgarth as its CEO, or Wire, which completed its pivot to enterprise customers and enjoyed some success during the pandemic.</p>
<p>However, it does spell the end of a dream team that has created some of the most interesting and influential startups of the 21st century so far.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe, Sony Innovation Fund by IGV, Hearst Ventures and individuals from Stone Point Capital also participated in the financing, which brings San Diego-based Truepic’s total raised since its 2015 inception to $36 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than trying to detect what is fake, <a href="http://www.truepic.com">Truepic</a> says its patented “secure” camera technology proves what is real. The startup’s technology acquires “provenance” data (such as origin, contents and metadata) about photos and videos and uses cryptography to protect the images from tampering before they reach the intended recipients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the company says its software can authenticate where photos were taken and prove that they were not manipulated since there are an increasing number of deceptive photos and personal information that can be purchased on the Dark Web, social media and via software that can change the metadata of an image’s time or location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our approach is unique in that we are verifying the authenticity of content at the point it is captured, which is also referred to as ‘provenance-based media authentication’ versus detecting anomalies or edits post-capture,” Truepic CEO Jeff McGregor told TechCrunch. “We believe that detection of fake images and videos will not be viable or scalable. Provenance-based media authentication is the most promising approach to universal visual trust online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truepic’s camera technology is software-based, and runs on mobile devices. Photos and videos captured through its camera are cryptographically assured to be unedited, original images, according to McGregor, with “trusted” metadata such as time, date and location. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Truepic’s technology &#8212; for which it has 13 patents &#8212; has been popular among an increasing number of financial services companies, McGregor said. Insurance companies, for example, are using it to verify claims remotely. This has been particularly meaningful during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in its early days when in-person interaction was avoided at all costs. But it also has a number of other use cases, he said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company must be doing something right. Its technology is used by over 100 enterprises, such as Equifax, EXL Service Inc, Ford Motor Company, Accion Opportunity Fund and Palomar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And last year, Truepic says its revenues grew by over 300% thanks to “dramatic client growth” across the insurance, banking, automotive, peer-to-peer commerce, project management and international development industries. McGregor declined to reveal hard revenue figures, though, so it’s hard to know just how significant 300% revenue growth is. He added that the company is intentionally not yet profitable as it is currently focused on speed of distribution for its core technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use cases for Truepic’s technology, according to McGregor, are quite broad given how pervasive untrusted photos and videos are. Its customers include any organization that is ingesting digital photo or video content, and requires a high level of trust in that content. For example, it works with insurance companies, banks, peer to peer commerce, online marketplaces, real estate and franchise organizations, warranty providers and automotive companies, among others. Generally, companies with platforms that rely on visual media &#8212; such as home rental, news media, online dating, social media, e-commerce, sharing economy, traditional media &#8212; can benefit from Truepic’s technology, according to McGregor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We imagine a world where the origin and authenticity of all digital content is verifiable, allowing humans to gain higher trust in what they view online,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M12 Principal James Wu said that t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he number of deep-fake videos and synthetic media online is growing at an exponential rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Used nefariously, manipulated media can result in negative political discourse, reputational consequences, and fraudulent claims,” he wrote via email. “The pervasiveness of synthetic media is a growing business risk for corporations &#8212; especially established brands &#8212; and solutions like Truepic will become an integral part of an enterprise’s end-to-end fraud management strategy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to describe Truepic as a “pioneer” in provenance technology, which M12 believes is the most reliable way to establish the integrity of the data contained in photo and video files. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There has been a great deal of investment in synthetic media, but very few are thinking about the other side of the coin &#8212; when synthetic media is used nefariously,” he said. “Truepic is at the forefront of providing tools to maintain a shared sense of reality online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital in part toward speeding up the release of a new product, Truepic Lens, that will power “trusted” image capture in third-party applications, “regardless of industry or use-case,” McGregor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will create a single integration point for any customer that requires trusted media to run their service,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to use the new capital to increase distribution for its current flagship product, Truepic Vision, a “turnkey” platform for requesting and “instant” reviewing of trusted photos and videos from anywhere in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also, naturally, plans to hire. It currently has 50 employees, up from about 25 a year ago. McGregor expects Truepic’s team will double to 100 over the next 18 months. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 51 of its Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Monday night at 8:55 PM PDT (11:55 PM EDT). This was the first launch for the Starlink satellite internet constellation from the west coast, and also the first batch of a second stage of Starlink satellite deployment, targeting a new orbital trajectory that will help the network provide service to new regions including Northern Canada and parts of Northern Europe.</p>
<p>The launch used a reflown Falcon 9 that had previously supported nine other missions, including seven prior Starlink flights. In total, SpaceX has now launched around 1,800 Starlink satellites, and it has been providing coverage to customers during its beta program for over a year now. The company said in August that it has now shipped around 100,000 terminals to customers, with over 90,000 active users on the service at the moment and a full order volume of around 500,000 kits in total.</p>

<p>SpaceX plans to expand the constellation considerably in order to continue to grow the footprint of where Starlink service is available globally. It ultimately aims to build out the constellation to where it consists of nearly 30,000 satellites, which should provide reliable worldwide broadband coverage for customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five months ago, Ambi Robotics emerged from stealth with a $6 million raise. Today the Bay Area-based firm is back with several times that, announcing a $26 million Series A, led by Tiger Global. The new round also features participation from existing investors, including Bow Capital, Vertex Ventures US and The House Fund.</p>
<p>The startup<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/robotics-roundup-6/"> first hit our radar</a> through the involvement of UC Berkeley (and frequent TC Sessions: Robotics guest Ken Goldberg). Ambi operates in the pick and place robotics space &#8212; it’s a crowded category, but one with an intense level of interest, as more warehouse and fulfillment centers are accelerating toward automation after the shutdowns of the past year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Ambi has already enlisted some high-profile partners, including Pitney Bowes. In spite of only coming out of stealth in April, the robotics startup began deploying its first systems &#8212; including the AmbiSort and AmbiKit &#8212; in October of last year, ahead of the massive holiday rush.</p>

<hr />
<p>The company’s primary differentiation is in the AI that powers its picking robotics system.</p>
<p>“Ambi Robotics combines cutting-edge AI technology with engaging user interfaces to transform the role of ‘item handlers’ to ‘robot handlers,’ ” CEO Jim Liefer said in a release. “With our Series A funding, we will be able to empower more companies to help their associates work harmoniously alongside robots.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest round will go toward scaling both the systems and the team of humans that build them, and deploying additional units.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More startup swapping in the food delivery space: Spain&#8217;s Glovo, an on-demand delivery platform which operates a network of dark stores focused on urban convenience shopping, is pushing deeper into planned grocery shopping &#8212; announcing the acquisition of two regional &#8216;Instacart-style&#8217; grocery picking and delivery startups, Madrid-based Lola Market and Portugal&#8217;s Mercadão.</p>
<p>Terms of the acquisitions are not being disclosed.</p>
<p>2015-founded Lola Market had raised around €3M, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lola-market/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>. It&#8217;s not clear how much Portugal&#8217;s Mercadão &#8212; which was founded in 2018 &#8212; had raised over its shorter run.</p>
<p>Glovo, meanwhile, raised a meaty <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/">$528M Series F back in April</a> &#8212; but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/glovo-delivery-hero-brands-consolidation-chicken/">quickly splurged $208M</a> to pick up three food delivery brands from rival Delivery Hero in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The Spanish on-demand delivery platform is facing challenges to its model on home turf where the government has applied a labor reform aimed at delivery workers in the gig economy.</p>
<p>The reform, agreed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/">earlier this year</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/gig-economy-crackdowns-are-off-to-a-bad-start-in-spain">came into application last month </a>&#8212; recognizing delivery platform riders as employees, or at least on paper.</p>
<p>Glovo responded by imposing a new self-employment model on the vast majority of riders on its platform, hiring only around a fifth. So the scene looks set for legal challenges in its home market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the European Union level, lawmakers are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">eyeing how to improve conditions for platform workers</a> &#8212; and could come with pan-EU legislation that has wider implications for the business models of regional players like Glovo.</p>

<p>Ongoing regulatory challenges over employment classification and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/italys-dpa-fines-glovo-owned-foodinho-3m-orders-changes-to-algorithmic-management-of-riders/">algorithmic management of workers in the gig economy</a> may offer some context for Glovo&#8217;s expanding interest in grocery purchasing in Europe, where it has been building out a network of dark stores to power what it calls &#8216;Q-commerce&#8217; (aka, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/spains-glovo-inks-real-estate-tie-up-to-add-more-dark-stores-for-speedy-urban-delivery/">quick urban convenience shopping</a>).</p>
<p>As well as for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/glovo-to-double-down-african-investment-in-the-next-12-months-but-will-it-stay-put/">recently announced international expansion in Africa</a>, where it has said it will be doubling down investment over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>But also the challenge of hitting profitability for pure on-demand food delivery looks like a sizeable piece of the puzzle here driving consolidation.</p>
<p>By adding players in the supermarket and retail outlet picking delivery space, Glovo expands its coverage of shoppers&#8217; needs &#8212; and can nudge users to spend more by being able to cross-sell them on planned purchases (such as the weekly grocery shop), as well as what it bills as &#8220;emergency essentials&#8221; and &#8220;fast action convenience&#8221; powered by the more limited inventory it can offer in its city center dark stores.</p>
<p>Both Lola Market and Mercadão&#8217;s brand identities will be retained, per Glovo, which also says they will operate independently &#8212; led by Gonçalo Soares da Costa, CEO of Mercadão.</p>
<p>It touts the acquisitions as strengthening its competitive position in Europe in &#8220;key markets&#8221; &#8212; going on to suggest it will add grocery picking and delivery across its entire market footprint, with an initial expansion planned for Poland and Italy.</p>
<p>Also today it said its Q-Commerce division is &#8220;on track&#8221; to reach an annual Gross Transaction Value (GTV) of more than €300M this year &#8212; adding that it expects that to more than triple by the end of 2022, projecting it will surpass a run rate of €1BN.</p>
<p>Commenting on its latest acquisitions in a statement, Oscar Pierre, CEO and co-founder of Glovo, added: “We see huge potential in the on-demand groceries marketplace and both companies are strong local players in their respective markets, and further strengthen our Q-Commerce offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Lola Market and Mercadão on board, we can build stronger partnerships with retailers, offer our users big-basket purchases and provide a more complete service. These acquisitions represent a significant step forward for us, as we’re now able to cover all of the main purchasing considerations for groceries customers, making Glovo a one-stop-shop for e-groceries.”</p>
