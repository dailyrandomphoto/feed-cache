										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://meethoneybee.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HoneyBee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aims to help companies provide access to financial support for their employees, announced today it has raised $5.7 million in equity in a round led by FFVC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolute Ventures, Afore Capital, Rebalance Capital, K50 and Financial Venture Studio also participated in the financing, along with two-time NBA all-star Baron Davis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HoneyBee has also secured a $100 million debt facility from CIM, an institutional impact investment manager that provides debt capital for innovation that lends to underserved communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Los Angeles-based <a href="https://bcorporation.net/about-b-corps#:~:text=Certified%20B%20Corporations%20are%20businesses%20that%20meet%20the,and%20build%20a%20more%20inclusive%20and%20sustainable%20economy.">Certified B Corp</a> describes itself as a B2B financial technology company that is on a mission to give employees &#8212; and their families &#8212; free access to financial support in the workplace as a benefit. That support could come in the form of employer-sponsored “no-cost rainy day funds” and on-demand financial therapy with the goal of “creating a healthier workforce environment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or put even more simply, HoneyBee aims to give HR and DEI leaders that say they are committed to creating an equitable and inclusive culture a way to provide access to financial tools and education to help improve their employees’ financial health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO and co-founder Ennie Lim said she was inspired to start HoneyBee after suffering financial setbacks after her own divorce several years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My credit was negatively impacted to the point where I found myself unable to get access to any affordable credit,” she recalls. “I wish I had done a lot of things differently, but I didn’t know what I didn’t know, and I was embarrassed to ask for help.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience helped Lim realize the importance of feeling in control of your financial life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It affects your self-esteem, happiness, and personal relationships and it made me want to help others take control of theirs,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lim teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benny Yiu and Max Zschoch in 2017 to build HoneyBee with that goal in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are solving a massive economic disparity and we&#8217;re leveling the playing field in the workplace by reducing the financial literacy gap and providing access to credit to people that need it most,” Lim said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to acknowledge that people come from different socioeconomic backgrounds. The varying levels of financial illiteracy is an issue we can no longer ignore.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198137" style="width: 293px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198137" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2198137 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?w=266" alt="" width="283" height="319" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg 1550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=266,300 266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=768,867 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=602,680 602w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=1360,1536 1360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HoneyBee.jpg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198137" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HoneyBee</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study conducted by Washington University in St Louis found that 89% of HoneyBee users are people of color, women, or both. During the pandemic, when the need for its offering was even greater, HoneyBee signed over 60 mid-markets companies as customers and is launching with Fortune 500 companies later this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup&#8217;s user growth grew by 225% during the pandemic and the company says it delivered over $2 million in rainy day funds. Meanwhile, its on-demand financial therapy usage increased by 172% over the prior year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Amidst this pandemic, when employers were cutting budgets, furloughing, laying off, reducing hours and salaries, we started to see a shift in their buying behavior to address financial health,” Lim said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honeybee’s customers include Alameda County Community Food Bank, DC Central Kitchen, Kate Somerville, Community Catalyst of California, Southwest Water Company, Straus Family Creamery, Asian Art Museum, Pasadena Humane Society and Peachtree Health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBA star Baron Davis grew up in South Central Los Angeles with his grandmother and says he believes strongly in the startup’s desire to provide access to affordable credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Financial literacy is a barbed wire for people like me. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential for companies to provide equitable access to financial support for their employees,” he wrote via email. “Financial access alleviates stress in the workplace especially when they are working hard to make ends meet to support their family. Providing easy access to money and education will result in a happier, healthier, productive workforce.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FFVC Partner AJ Plotkin said his firm likes that the structure of the product “solves a serious access problem for customers who need a bridge for short-term, emergency needs, in a way that is not burdensome for the employee or the employer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital in part to grow its sales, engineering, and customer success team. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.jetty.com">Jetty,</a> a fintech company which aims to give renters flexibility when paying rent, has raised $23 million in a funding round co-led by Citi and Flourish Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing brings Jetty’s total raised since its 2016 inception to $78 million. Other investors participating in the latest growth round include Credit Ease and K5. Previous backers include Farmers Insurance Group, Khosla and Ribbit Capital, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100-person New York City-based startup has come up with a way to help renters make rent on time with an offering that resembles the ‘buy now, pay later’ (BNPL) model that is increasingly used by consumers at the point of sale, online and in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, renters can pay their rent when it’s due and then have up until the 24th of the month to pay the money back to Jetty  &#8212; either in a lump sum or via installments. They don’t pay interest charges or late fees, but rather a monthly subscription fee ranging from $15 to $25, depending on the renter&#8217;s risk profile. If the renter fails to pay back the money during the agreed upon time, they will not be able to borrow more for the following month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monthly fee is “far lower” than any potential late fee if the rent is not paid on time, said co-founder and CEO Mike Rudoy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Around 50% of the average renter&#8217;s paycheck is going to rent. So this is the largest expense of any renter, on a given month,” he said. “And so you would expect that there would be some type of financial services product that would give them the flexibility that they need to come up with the money on time in such a way that they weren&#8217;t penalized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The offering is more of a cousin to traditional BNPL, he said, than actual BNPL.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will pay the rent on behalf of the renter in full on the first of the month, giving property managers the money they need when they need it,” Rudoy explained. “Renters get 24 days to pay it back on a schedule that suits their needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To launch Jetty Rent, the company partnered with Cortland, a large real estate investment, development and management company, to roll out the offering in beta to residents across a portfolio of properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the startup is launching the offering to the public. Jetty Rent is the newest product on the startup’s platform, which also offers “low cost” renters insurance as well as security deposit replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mission of the company is to make renting more affordable and flexible,” Rudoy said. “And we are a financial services platform whereby every product that we have launched is meant to both provide value to both property managers as well as renters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the move, Jetty is evolving from being an insurtech to also a lender, said Rudoy. The company is providing the loans through Cross River Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are working to bring some additional credit and lending prowess to the business given the fact it has historically been considered an insurtech company,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that the company offers all three products to property managers gives it a competitive edge, according to Rudoy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This makes us different from other financial services companies attacking the same space and problem set,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re the only one that has both a security deposit alternative and flexible rent product under the same roof. It makes the choice to work with us much easier if you’re a property manager, from an integration and onboarding perspective. It means fewer different brands in front of renters as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renters pay for all the products and the property managers are partners in the distribution of the products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the company has agreements with property owners and managers that operate more than 2.2 million rental units across the country. Since starting to build its property partner network in 2017, Jetty has seen 193% average year over growth in contracted units, according to Alex Vlasto, the company&#8217;s VP of marketing. Besides Cortland, it also works with AMLI Residential, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmalyn Shaw, managing partner of Flourish Ventures, notes that over 70% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stable housing is a critical component in helping them achieve financial security,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jetty, Shaw added, is the only company “that extends beyond a single solution to embed a rich and differentiated set of financial offerings” including rental insurance, security deposit alternatives and now rent flexibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through its unique consumer insights, differentiated pricing, increased consumer loyalty, Jetty has achieved a significant competitive advantage,” she wrote via email. “Moreover, their consumer reach through top property management entities like Cortland is unparalleled.”</span></p>
<p>As of late, other startups that have come up with new technology to make the lives of renters easier have also raised money. <a href="https://www.sugarliving.com/">Sugar</a>, a startup that aims to turn apartment buildings into “interactive communities,” recently closed on $2.5 million in seed funding.  And, <a href="https://www.getrentcheck.com/">RentCheck</a>, a startup that has built out an automated property inspection platform, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/rentcheck-raises-millions/">raised $2.6 million in seed money</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emulate Inc., a biotech company focused on developing “organ-on-a-chip” technology, closed an $82 million Series E round on Tuesday. This latest round is intended to formulate a massive investment in a “roadmap” for developing model organ systems created to fit drugmakers&#8217; needs and bring the idea of an organ-on-a-chip into use in the lab. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An organ-on-a-chip is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: it’s a recreation of a human organ (or system of human organs) scaled down into a tiny piece of hardware about the size of a AA battery. That hardware, the so-called “chip,” contains chambers where human cells (like brain cells, the kidney, lung, brain intestine, etc), can be grown. Then the chip can be manipulated to simulate breathing, blood flow through an organ or other mechanical forces that might happen in a human body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the chip is supposed to mimic the conditions within a human body, and allow drugmakers to better predict what might happen when a new candidate is introduced. It’s a new model for experiments that could prove critical in the pre-clinical study process. Right now that area of research is dominated by traditional cell- or animal-based models – though Emulate, and other similar companies are hoping to change that paradigm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emulate was founded in 2013 and has, so far, raised about $255 million in funding. This most recent Series E round, led by Northpond Ventures and Perceptive Advisors, is part of Emulate’s plan to invest more heavily in R&amp;D, and create specific organ-on-a-chip applications that they’ve honed in on through conversations with drug companies. So far, Emulate counts 21 major drug companies, including Roche, Genentech, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Gilead Sciences as customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We researched what pharma is spending their R&amp;D dollars on – particular types of molecules, biologics and so-forth – then we created a roadmap, a series of applications aligned to where big pharma is spending their money” Jim </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corbett</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the CEO of Emulate tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, Emulate announced several new products and services that are part of this roadmap. They include the Emulate brain chip, designed to aid with research into central nervous system disorders (like Alzheimer’s), an immune cell recruitment application that will investigate how the immune system interacts across the lungs, liver, and intestine (using lung-chips, liver-chips, and intestine chips), and a microbiome model integrated into the liver chip. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corbett says the company will look to roll out 14 applications over the next two years, seven of which will roll out next year. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organs on chips have been around for about a decade. The NIH has </span><a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/tissuechip/projects/space"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched them into spac</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">e to study the effects of spaceflight, and has been developing tissue chip testing and validation programs </span><a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/tissuechip/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">since 2010</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/7/3/112/htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 review paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bioengineering </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes the organ-on-a-chip industry was recently valued around $21 million, but could grow to about $220 million by 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of that growth will depend on the potential for an organ-on-a-chip to disrupt the preclinical side of the drug testing process. And that itself depends a lot on how the FDA views data collected on that platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The specific organ-on-a-chip technology itself doesn’t need to be FDA approved (it’s not a  therapeutic or device), but drug companies will almost certainly seek assurance that the agency is receptive to experiments using organs-on-chips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Corbett’s perspective, he says the FDA has proved “very receptive” to data collected on these platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is evidence the company has worked closely with the FDA in the past. </span><a href="https://emulatebio.com/press/fda-organ-chip-crada-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, Emulate entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), with the FDA. A CRADA agreement allows a non-federal collaborator to provide funding and equipment for a research project conducted at an FDA laboratory. The FDA provides no funding, but does allow for the collaborator to license intellectual property developed during such projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this program, Emulate’s lung chips were used in COVID-19 research. The brain chip, liver, and intestine chips were also used for individual research projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDA collaboration aside there’s also been regulatory movement that could favor companies pursuing organ chips. For instance, the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2565/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.+1%22%5D%7D&amp;r=33&amp;s=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDA Modernization Act of 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced in Congress in April, which would allow the FDA to use “alternative testing methods to animal testing” to evaluate safety and efficacy of drugs. The bill specifically includes organs on chips in its definition of a non-clinical test or study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the Modernization Act goes through, it&#8217;s clearly spelled out,” says Corbett. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the field of organ-on-a-chip research is relatively new. Whether or not it will eventually help more drug candidates materialize is still theory. Though, with a new round of funding and a changing regulatory environment, we could have solid answers sooner rather than later. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Managers are occasionally evaluated by their team&#8217;s occupational wellness — the sometimes-hazy calculation that rates employees’ professional and personal contentment. What may not be as commonly tested is the connected concept of <a href="https://blog.smarp.com/employee-engagement-8-statistics-you-need-to-know">employee engagement</a>, which measures how committed employees are to helping their company succeed. While 71% of executives <a href="https://fasttrack.com.au/blog/employee-engagement-leads-to-greater-productivity/">cite employee engagement as essential</a> to their success, a mere 15% of U.S. employees <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx">consider</a> themselves engaged.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for employers, when we look through either the contentment or engagement lens, we see a workforce in crisis — <a href="https://mhanational.org/sites/default/files/Mind%20the%20Workplace%20-%20MHA%20Workplace%20Health%20Survey%202017%20FINAL.PDF">upward of 70% of U.S. workers</a> are so unhappy in their roles that they are thinking about and/or actively looking for a new job.</p>
<p>What’s behind all this? Developmental stagnation at work and the opportunity for a better role elsewhere, often defined not merely as one with more pay, but as one presenting a pathway toward <a href="https://turningpointexecsearch.com/blog/employers/good-employees-quit/">personal and professional growth</a> and upward mobility.</p>

			Rather than list out the litany of errors, let’s gauge your company’s employee development and engagement efforts.					</blockquote>

<p>The pandemic has only exacerbated the dissatisfaction of many employees — at varied levels — who feel stuck in unfulfilling jobs, with little guidance on how to advance or pivot in their careers and achieve the dignity of meaningful, impactful work.</p>
<p>This piece aims to deliver a simple action plan for assessing your employees’ engagement level and taking targeted steps to build the kind of committed and reliable workforce necessary to survive and thrive in today’s marketplace.</p>
<h2>Common failures in corporate career development efforts</h2>
<p>While researching employee retention when building our startup, we identified a number of common and recurring shortcomings in career-development practices — ones that are likely to be familiar to most Fortune 500 companies, as well as scaling, high-growth startups.</p>
<p>We focused on the <a href="https://irrationallabs.com/">activities</a> and <a href="https://worldmanagementsurvey.org/">strategies</a> companies use to align their skills needs with workers&#8217; capabilities and aspirations — specifically, their approach to advancing staff toward jobs deemed both desirable to employees and essential to employers.</p>
<p>We found significant behavioral-design failure points across three main areas: Their strategic framework for employee engagement and advancement; implementation process and templates; and goal setting and rewards.</p>
<p>To understand the companies&#8217; strategic framework, we examined upskilling and tuition reimbursement policies and spend; individualized employee future-fit assessments; tools for employee career pathway modeling and advancement; and early-in-career and diverse-hire career-progression programs.</p>
<p>For implementation processes and templates, we examined onboarding; employee performance and development cycle; manager feedback; and succession planning.</p>
<p>For goal setting and rewards, we examined manager and VP-level goals and rewards connected directly to their activities and performance in developing and advancing employee careers.</p>
<h2>Take this employee development survey</h2>
<p>Let’s gauge your company’s employee development and engagement efforts. How many of the following can you answer with a “yes”?</p>
<ol>
<li>Has your company run a process to define skills or talent-gaps across organizations in the past two years?</li>
<li>As part of such a process, did your company define a role taxonomy for essential roles?</li>
<li>Do you have a process and the tools for mapping existing personnel to that taxonomy, whether from within or outside the relevant organization?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life exposed the personal information of hundreds of job applicants after a website bug allowed anyone to access their resumes, which were stored in an unprotected directory on its website.</p>
<p>A security researcher told TechCrunch that the group&#8217;s main website, built largely in WordPress, was not properly protecting the file storage on its website, which it used to store resumes of more than 300 job applicants, as well as other files uploaded to the website. The resumes contained names, phone numbers, addresses, and details of a person&#8217;s employment history.</p>
<p>The website bug was fixed over the weekend, a short time after details of the leak were posted on Twitter. The group&#8217;s website no longer lists any of the exposed files.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are taking action to protect the concerned individuals,&#8221; said Kimberlyn Schwartz, a spokesperson for Texas Right to Life told TechCrunch, referring to those who &#8220;sought and circulated the information.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked, Schwartz would not say if the organization planned on informing those whose personal information was exposed by its security lapse.</p>
<p>Texas Right to Life sparked anger when last week it publicized a &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; website that encouraged Texas residents to report when someone might be seeking an abortion in violation of the state&#8217;s restrictive new abortion law. The law allows anyone to sue someone seeking an abortion, or anyone &#8220;aiding and abetting&#8221; an abortion after six weeks. That provision has been widely interpreted as targeting doctors who perform these procedures, but also <a href="https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-you-can-help-shut-down-the-vile-website-for-1847557293">potentially anyone</a> who gets involved, such as contributing money or driving a friend to a clinic.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for the &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; website to be flooded with fake tips, memes, and Shrek porn in protest. The site briefly fell offline Thursday, which coincided with an activist <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3x9ba/tiktok-texas-abortion-law-bot-site-ios-shortcut">releasing an iOS shortcut</a> to help anyone pre-fill the website&#8217;s form with fake information.</p>
<p>But by the weekend, GoDaddy, the company hosting the website, told Texas Right to Life that the site <a href="https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-you-can-help-shut-down-the-vile-website-for-1847557293">violated its terms</a> of service and gave the group 24 hours to find another host. It did — briefly — by way of Epik, a web host that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/the-far-rights-favorite-registrar-is-building-censorship-resistant-servers/">helped other controversial sites</a> like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/28/far-right-social-network-gab-goes-offline-after-godaddy-tells-it-to-find-another-domain-registrar/">far-right social networks Gab</a> get back online. But that didn&#8217;t last long either.</p>
<p>As of Monday, the &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; website pointed to Texas Right to Life&#8217;s main website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/">Peanut</a>, a social networking app for women, initially found traction connecting women in the earlier stages of their motherhood journey. But over the years, the network expanded to support women through other life stages. Now, that will include menopause, as well &#8212; a life stage that will impact nearly half the world&#8217;s population at some point, but where opportunities there are few online communities where women can connect and learn.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been thinking about this life stage for a long time, in terms of how it is so underserved,&#8221; explains Peanut founder and CEO Michelle Kennedy. &#8220;By 2025, there are going to be a billion women who are in menopause at that moment&#8230;and yet, when you think about what is there and accessible in terms of community, social [networking], and support &#8212; there&#8217;s literally nothing,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The company saw the opportunity in this market by observing what women were already discussing on the app, Kennedy says.</p>
<p>Although the app had historically skewed towards younger women just getting started with marriages and family, there were a number of women who had undergone surgical or chemically-induced menopause because of something like breast cancer or some other medical condition. This had put them into early or premature menopause, and they began to discuss how that was impacting their life &#8212; particularly as younger parents. There were also women who felt like they may have begun to experience menopause but were having their concerns dismissed by their doctors because they were too young. They wanted to talk about their symptoms with others who were going through the same thing. Others, meanwhile, were older and entering menopause, and were in search of community.</p>

<p>To address this market, Peanut is expanding with the launch of Peanut Menopause, a dedicated space in the app where women can meet others who are at a similar life stage &#8212; whether that&#8217;s other premenopausal, menopausal, or postmenopausal women.</p>
<p>Women can join groups, ask questions, and get advice, or even join live audio conversations hosted by experts, through Peanut&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/">newer live audio rooms feature, Peanut Pods</a>.  And they can use the app&#8217;s matchmaking feature to discover other women who are also in their same demographic, where they can chat using messaging or video.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kennedy notes that the topic of menopause is something women have historically kept quiet about, often suffering in silence due to the lack of resources available to them when it comes on online networking and support groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men are never going to build this for us, so we have to build it for ourselves,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We have to build what we want and what we need.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198696" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198696" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198696" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PR_Menopause_Group_Post.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198696" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Peanut</p></div></p>
<p>The expansion may bring a broader group of women to Peanut. Today, the average age of the Peanut user is around 32, but the menopause-focused communities may attract women in the 49-plus age demographic, in addition to those who are going through the experience at a younger age, for other reasons.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Peanut, not all investors see the opportunity in addressing the needs of menopausal women. In fact, on a recent phone call, Kennedy said one investor seemed dismayed about the expansion, noting they had really loved &#8220;the younger age demo.&#8221; Kennedy said this comment blew her away.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are women who are at a stage in their life where they probably have more disposable income,&#8221; she said of the new demographic Peanut is now including. &#8220;They are more considered users, in many respects. They&#8217;re not as flighty. They don&#8217;t have 30 apps on their phone, and the ones they have on their phone they&#8217;re really invested in. It&#8217;s just astonishing to me that someone in the investment community would make a comment like that,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Peanut is not yet monetizing its users and doesn&#8217;t intend to do so using ads Instead, the company&#8217;s plan is to eventually introduce the freemium model where women will pay to unlock a set of premium features &#8212; a model that worked well in the dating app industry, where Kennedy has roots as the former deputy CEO at dating app Badoo and an inaugural board member at Bumble.</p>
<p>The feature is the latest in a long line of expansions over the years &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/peanut-the-matchmaking-app-for-moms-launches-a-community-feature-called-peanut-pages/">Q&amp;A forums, Peanut Pages,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/social-network-for-motherhood-peanut-raises-5m-expands-to-include-women-trying-to-conceive/">Peanut Groups</a>, and recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/">Peanut Pods</a> &#8212; that have helped Peanut evolve into an online community that serves over 2 million users. The Peanut app is available as a free download across both iOS and Android, while a preview of its communities are <a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/posts">available on the web</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As developers look for ways to simplify how they create software, serverless solutions, which enable them to write code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure required to run their applications, is becoming increasingly popular. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> announced today that it is enhancing its existing offering in this area with the acquisition of serverless startup <a href="https://nimbella.com/">Nimbella</a>. The companies did not share the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>With Nimbella, the company is getting a platform for building serverless applications that is built on the open source container orchestration platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/04/how-kubernetes-came-to-rule-the-world/">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://openwhisk.apache.org/">Apache OpenWhisk</a>, which is itself an open source serverless development platform.</p>
<p>DigitalOcean CEO Yancey Spruill, who took over two years ago, refers to Nimbella&#8217;s capabilities as Function as a Service with the goal being to simplify serverless development in an open source context for its target customers.&#8221;Serverless kinds of capabilities are taking a whole level of the infrastructure burden away from developers and businesses and we absorb that. We&#8217;ll allow our customers to have more configurability around the tools, which just removes burdens for them and allows them to go faster,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In practical terms, Nimbella CEO Anshu Agarwal says that means they are providing a specific set of tools to build sophisticated serverless applications and connect to other DigitalOcean services. &#8220;The capabilities that we will be adding to DigitalOcean portfolio are a fast solution, a function as a service solution that also integrates with the underlying DigitalOcean services [like] managed databases, storage and other services that make it make it easier for a developer to develop full applications, not just addressing events, but doing things which are completely stateless,&#8221; Agarwal explained.</p>
<p>Spruill said that this wasn&#8217;t the company&#8217;s first foray into serverless. That began last year when it offered its initial serverless tooling, but it wanted to build on its current offering and Nimbella fit the bill.</p>
<p>DigitalOcean is a cloud Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service provider, aiming at individual developers, startups and SMBs. While DigitalOcean&#8217;s $318 million 2020 revenue was a fraction of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/the-cloud-infrastructure-market-hit-129b-in-2020/"> $129 billion cloud market</a>, it is proof that there is still money to be made even with a small slice of that market.</p>
<p>The companies did not discuss the terms of the deal, the number of employees involved or even the title that Agarwal would have when the deal closed, but the plan is to fully integrate Nimbella into the DigitalOcean portfolio and eventually make it a DigitalOcean-branded product some time in the first half of next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Glovo is available in more than 40 cities with more than 300,000 users, 8,000 restaurants and 12,000 couriers in these countries. Earlier this year, it launched operations in Lagos, Nigeria and Accra, Ghana before expanding to Tema, another Ghanaian city last month.</p>
<p>Over the next 12 months, Glovo says it will invest an additional €50M ($60M) to drive expansion into more cities on the continent and move into new markets like Tunisia, where it plans to launch in Tunis next month.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the company, the expansion will make Glovo&#8217;s services available to 6.5 million people. Co-founder Sacha Michaud believes these markets are currently underserved, and Glovo has found the right opportunity to work with local restaurants, bringing them online to reach new customers in a bid to &#8220;make everything, within all towns and cities, available to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attention on Africa follows a series of regional moves Glovo has pulled this year. After its mammoth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/">$528 million Series F raise</a>, it acquired several <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/glovo-delivery-hero-brands-consolidation-chicken/">Delivery Hero&#8217;s businesses</a> in Central and Eastern Europe for $208 million.</p>

<p>Now present in 23 countries, Africa represents 30% of the company&#8217;s geographical footprint. And the Spanish company plans to be live in 30 countries before the end of next year, a decision in part due to an IPO target in three years.</p>
<p>Glovo says it is a market leader in 80% of the countries where it has operations. The company&#8217;s grocery service arm has grown the fastest and revenue has been increasing significantly after a steady rise in orders. To meet the growing needs of customers, Glovo has had to invest heavily in dark stores and launched virtual brands for restaurants in July.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if Glovo will extend these add-on services to Africa where it has its largest market in terms of population size: Nigeria. Yet, the West African nation does not come without its own fair share of troubles like poor logistics infrastructure and an unpredictable regulatory environment.</p>
<p>Despite that, a couple of food delivery platforms like Gokada and Jumia Food, a subsidiary of e-commerce giant Jumia have tried to scale, finding varying degrees of success doing so.</p>
<p>While Glovo will have to compete for market share with these players, it is bullish because of its multi-category strategy, for which grocery sales account for half of its business in some African markets.</p>
<p>That said, Glovo&#8217;s performance in emerging markets is questionable. Last year, the company pulled out of all the Latin American countries &#8212; Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. It sold operations in these markets to Delivery Hero for $272 million.</p>
<p>The company also exited the Middle East and North Africa (Egypt and Turkey) and Uruguay and Puerto Rico in January 2020.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, Glovo has said it wanted to achieve profitability in a short amount of time. The delivery space is a thin-margin business and it is thinner in emerging markets. This played a part in why Glovo exited both Middle East and Latin America. The market isn&#8217;t any different in Africa, and time will tell if the Spanish delivery will stay put, exit, or close shop.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, Glovo says it is &#8220;committed to continuing its policy to hire top local talent&#8221; on the continent and plans to double its number of staff and add an extra 200 employees before the end of next year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Our expansion in Nigeria, Ghana, and our upcoming launch in Tunisia is something we’ve been looking at for some time now, so it’s great to be able to make it official. There’s been an unprecedented spike in the on-demand delivery business in Africa and the expansion of our services to new countries and cities is both a reflection of that trend and a testament to our commitment to the continent. We’re looking forward to making food, groceries, pharmaceuticals, and retail products available to our new users at the touch of a button,” William Benthall, Glovo&#8217;s general manager of sub-Saharan Africa, said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After living through the global upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/16/us-workers-want-career-change/">re-evaluating</a> their career path. Stefan Heinrich Henriquez, a former Head of Global Marketing at TikTok and Chief Marketing Officer at Cameo, is one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been thinking about music since my time at TikTok, and I was really thinking about building something on my own, but then it took me another year to finally have the guts to do it,&#8221; said Henriquez. &#8220;Then when the pandemic started, I think so many people were thinking about like, ‘What am I doing with my life?&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with his co-founder Akiva Bamberger, who was a software engineer on Snap&#8217;s Spectacles, Henriquez began work on <a href="http://mayk.it">mayk.it</a> last summer. Today, the social music app launches on iOS and announces its $4 million seed round from investors including Greycroft, Chicago Ventures, Slow Ventures, firstminute, Steven Galanis, Randi Zuckerberg, YouTuber Mr. Beasts’ Night media, Spotify’s first CMO Sophia Bendz, Cyan Banister, artist T-Pain and music industry veteran Zach Katz, among others.</p>
<p>Mayk.it wants to help people easily produce, own, and share music that they can create using just their phone. Users can upload their own beat or select an existing beat from another user, then add vocals (voice effects and somewhat corny lyric generators are available if you&#8217;re shy), and then add a visual from Giphy. Once you make (or, &#8220;mayk&#8221;) something, you can post it on the app, where other users can see it via a discovery page, which categorizes music by feeling or theme, rather than genre.</p>
<p>Mayk.it also poses &#8220;ideas,&#8221; or prompts to spur creativity, like &#8220;What is your pet thinking about right now?&#8221; or &#8220;Make a song about your first crush.&#8221; There&#8217;s also a Tinder-like tab that lets you swipe left or right on songs &#8212; if you really like it, you can leave a comment (called an &#8220;encouragement&#8221; in an attempt to keep things supportive) or remix it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2197713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=768,413 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=1536,826 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=2048,1102 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8030-copy.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Of course, for creators who might want to get a bit more serious about their creations, remixing and collaborating poses a question of ownership &#8212; if someone writes a beat and another user sings over it, who owns it? While you can&#8217;t monetize music on mayk.it, you have the right to export it and sell it elsewhere. Henriquez said that anyone involved in the creation of an audio clip or song on the app gets an equal cut, so the beat-maker would get 50% of any profit, and the singer would get 50%. Mayk.it doesn&#8217;t take a cut.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, the mayk.it doesn&#8217;t have in-app purchases, but Henriquez said that down the road, it could be possible to profit from working with brands or establishing an in-app marketplace. For now, mayk.it is focused on using its seed funding to add new features, improve the product and build a tool that inspires creativity &#8212; Henriquez added that, as an LGBTQ+ founder, it&#8217;s important to him that users can find community on the app through its social features.</p>
<p class="p1">“When I worked at YouTube, you really needed to know Adobe Premiere and After Effects,” said Henriquez. “And what I learned since <span class="s1">Musical.ly</span> and TikTok is that you could be a video creator or an actor without having to go through all these things. I think Roblox is doing that now with games, and Canva is doing that with design tools.”</p>
<p>Mayk.it wants to be like a Roblox or Canva for music composition and sharing. You can&#8217;t currently create something on mayk.it that sounds like it came from an artist who&#8217;s mastered Ableton, but something from mayk.it could easily make the rounds on TikTok.</p>
<p>Though mayk.it is now in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mayk-it/id1527850965">App Store</a>, there&#8217;s a waitlist to gain access &#8212; but you can also test your skills with a &#8220;vibe check,&#8221; which invites you to make a song and see if existing users will right-swipe you in. Not to brag, but we passed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bringing order and understanding to unstructured information located across disparate silos has been one of more significant breakthroughs of the big data era, and today a European startup that has built a platform to help with this challenge specifically in the area of life sciences &#8212; and has, notably, been used by labs to sequence and so far identify two major Covid-19 variants &#8212; is announcing some funding to continue building out its tools to a wider set of use cases, and to expand into North America.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seqera.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seqera Labs</a>, a Barcelona-based data orchestration and workflow platform tailored to help scientists and engineers order and gain insights from cloud-based genomic data troves, as well as to tackle other life science applications that involve harnessing complex data from multiple locations, has raised $5.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.taliscapital.com/"><span class="s2">Talis Capital</span></a> and <a href="https://www.speedinvest.com/"><span class="s2">Speedinvest</span></a> co-led this round, with participation also from previous backer <a href="https://www.boxoneventures.com/"><span class="s2">BoxOne Ventures</span></a> and a grant from the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/"><span class="s2">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,</span></a> Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan&#8217;s effort to back open source software projects for science applications.</p>
<p>Seqera &#8212; a portmanteau of &#8220;sequence&#8221; and &#8220;era&#8221;, the age of sequencing data, basically &#8212; had previously raised less than $1 million, and quietly, it is already generating revenues, with five of the world&#8217;s biggest pharmaceutical companies part of its customer base, alongside biotech and other life sciences customers.</p>
<p>Seqera was spun out of the Centre for Genomic Regulation, a biomedical research center based out of Barcelona, where it was built as the commercial application of <a href="https://www.nextflow.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nextflow</a>, open-source workflow and data orchestration software originally created by the founders of Seqera, Evan Floden and Paolo Di Tommaso, at the CGR.</p>
<p>Floden, Seqera&#8217;s CEO, told TechCrunch that he and Di Tommaso were motivated to create Seqera in 2018 after seeing Nextflow gain a lot of traction in the life science community, and subsequently getting a lot of repeat requests for further customization and features. Both Nextflow and Seqera have seen a lot of usage: the Nextflow runtime has been downloaded over 2 million times, the company said, while Seqera&#8217;s commercial cloud offering has now processed more than 5 billion tasks.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic is a classic example of the acute challenge that Seqera (and by association Nextflow) aims to address in the scientific community. With Covid-19 outbreaks happening globally, each time a test for Covid-19 is processed in a lab, live genetic samples of the virus get collected. Taken together, these millions of tests represent a goldmine of information about the coronavirus and how it is mutating, and when and where it is doing so. For a new virus about which so little is understood and that is still persisting, that&#8217;s invaluable data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So the problem is not if the data exists for better insights (it does); it is that it&#8217;s nearly impossible to use more legacy tools to view that data as a holistic body. It&#8217;s in too many places, and there is just too much of it, and it&#8217;s growing every day (and changing every day), which means that traditional approaches of porting data to a centralized location to run analytics on it just wouldn&#8217;t be efficient, and would cost a fortune to execute.</p>
<p>That is where Segera comes in. The company&#8217;s technology treats each source of data across different clouds as a salient pipeline which can be merged and analyzed as a single body, without that data ever leaving the boundaries of the infrastructure where it already exists. Customised to focus on genomic troves, scientists can then query that information for more insights. Seqera was central to the discovery of both the alpha and delta variants of the virus, and work is still ongoing as Covid-19 continues to hammer the globe.</p>
<p>Seqera is being used in other kinds of medical applications, such as in the realm of so-called &#8220;precision medicine.&#8221; This is emerging as a very big opportunity in complex fields like oncology: cancer mutates and behaves differently depending on many factors, including genetic differences of the patients themselves, which means that treatments are less effective if they are &#8220;one size fits all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Increasingly, we are seeing approaches that leverage machine learning and big data analytics to better understand individual cancers and how they develop for different populations, to subsequently create more personalized treatments, and Seqera comes into play as a way to sequence that kind of data.</p>
<p class="p2">This also highlights something else notable about the Seqera platform: it is used directly by the people who are analyzing the data &#8212; that is, the researchers and scientists themselves, without data specialists necessarily needing to get involved. This was a practical priority for the company, Floden told me, but nonetheless, it&#8217;s an interesting detail of how the platform is inadvertently part of that bigger trend of &#8220;no-code/low-code&#8221; software, designed to make highly technical processes usable by non-technical people.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s both the existing opportunity, and how Seqera might be applied in the future across other kinds of data that lives in the cloud, that makes it an interesting company, and it seems an interesting investment, too.</p>
<p class="p2"><b></b>&#8220;Advancements in machine learning, and the proliferation of volumes and types of data, are leading to increasingly more applications of computer science in life sciences and biology,&#8221; said Kirill Tasilov, principal at Talis Capital, in a statement. “While this is incredibly exciting from a humanity perspective, it’s also skyrocketing the cost of experiments to sometimes millions of dollars per project as they become computer-heavy and complex to run. Nextflow is already a ubiquitous solution in this space and Seqera is driving those capabilities at an enterprise level – and in doing so, is bringing the entire life sciences industry into the modern age. We’re thrilled to be a part of Seqera’s journey.”</p>
<p>“With the explosion of biological data from cheap, commercial DNA sequencing, there is a pressing need to analyse increasingly growing and complex quantities of data,&#8221; added Arnaud Bakker, principal at Speedinvest. &#8220;Seqera’s open and cloud-first framework provides an advanced tooling kit allowing organisations to scale complex deployments of data analysis and enable data-driven life sciences solutions.”</p>
<p class="p2">Although medicine and life sciences are perhaps Seqera&#8217;s most obvious and timely applications today, the framework originally designed for genetics and biology can be applied to are a number of other areas: AI training, image analysis and astronomy are three early use cases, Floden said. Astronomy is perhaps very apt, since it seems that the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think we are in the century of biology,&#8221; Floden said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the center of activity and it’s becoming data-centric, and we are here to build services around that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/elvie/">Elvie</a>, the women&#8217;s health tech pioneer behind a connected breast pump and smart pelvic floor exerciser, has topped up a Series C which it announced earlier this summer (July) &#8212; adding a further £12.7m to bring the total raised to £70 million ($97m).</p>
<p>The 2013-founded, UK-based startup previously raised a $42M Series B<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/elvie-raises-42m-to-become-the-go-to-destination-for-womens-health/"> in 2019</a>, and a $6M Series A in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/elvie-pulls-in-6m-series-a-to-build-a-global-female-health-tech-brand/">2017</a> &#8212; when femtech startups were a lot rarer than they are now. Products designed for (and often by) women have gained a lot of momentum over this period as female-led startups have blazed a trail and shown there&#8217;s a sizeable market for femtech &#8212; leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/femtechs-billion-dollar-year/">investors to slow clock on to the opportunity too</a>.</p>
<p>Analysts now project the femtech industry will become a $50 billion market by 2025.</p>
<p>Elvie says the Series C extension includes funds sponsored by the co-founders of Blume Equity – a PE firm that focuses on the food and health sectors – plus further capital from existing investors IPGL, Hiro Capital and Westerly Winds.</p>
<p>In July, when it announced the earlier ($80M) tranche of the raise, Elvie said the Series C was led by BGF and BlackRock alongside existing investors including Octopus Ventures.</p>
<p>The Series C will be used to drive for more growth through geographical expansion (including entering new markets) and diversifying its product portfolio to target other &#8220;key stages&#8221; in women&#8217;s lives, it said.</p>
<p>That means it&#8217;ll be splashing out on R&amp;D to support product development &#8212; connected hardware that blends physical gadgetry with software still looks to be a strong focus &#8212; and also on strengthening its ops and infrastructure to prep for further scale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Elvie sells four products at this stage: Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/elvie-early-impressions/">connected kegel trainer</a>, and a wearable <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/14/kegel-trainer-startup-elvie-is-launching-a-smaller-smarter-breast-pump/">breast pump</a> (plus two <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/elvie-adds-a-non-electric-breast-pump-and-cups-to-its-growing-femtech-portfolio/">non-electric pumps</a>).</p>
<p>Where the company goes next in terms of product will be an interesting one to watch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting in a statement, Tania Boler, CEO and founder, said: “Elvie is ready for the next phase of our growth. We have already revolutionized the categories we operate in, but we know that there is vast untapped potential to create better technology products and services for women in new areas.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">She added that Elvie&#8217;s goal is to create &#8220;the go-to destination for women’s health at all life stages&#8221; &#8212; selling &#8220;sophisticated, accurate and personalised solutions&#8221; to its target female consumer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elvie doesn&#8217;t break out product sales but it told us its pump business has doubled in the US over the last 12 months &#8212; adding that they are the highest single breast pump SKU revenue driver on Amazon in the US.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company also touts &#8220;strong&#8221; growth for its European business &#8212; at 139% YoY. While, in the UK market, it says it&#8217;s seen a further +31% growth YoY over the last 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai Motor Group is backing hydrogen as a top energy solution for sustainability. With its new fuel cell system that it plans to launch in the next few years, the South Korean automaker said it will provide hydrogen fuel cell versions for all its commercial vehicles by 2028.</p>
<p>Hyundai announced its strategy for the future of hydrogen on Tuesday during a live stream of the automaker&#8217;s Hydrogen Wave conference. Saehoon Kim, executive vice president and head of the fuel cell center at Hyundai Motor Group, said Hyundai&#8217;s goal is to also achieve cost competitiveness comparable to that of EV batteries by 2030.</p>
<p>The company also shared details about its high-performance, rear-wheel drive hydrogen sports car, the Vision FK, with a 500kW fuel cell system that can push it from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in under four seconds and has 600 kilometers (373 miles) of range. Hyundai did not share when the vehicle would go into production.</p>
<p>As most automakers begin to roll out electric vehicles for both passenger and commercial use, hydrogen is still a bit of a niche market, but one that is growing as Europe, China and the United States set ambitious emissions reductions goals. Toyota Motor Corp, BMW and Daimler have all begun embracing hydrogen fuel cell technology to varying degree, even as they continue to develop exclusively electric vehicles. For its part, Hyundai&#8217;s commitment to hydrogen doesn&#8217;t deter from its commitment to electric. With the climate situation as it is, we&#8217;re facing an all hands on deck situation. May the best fuel win.</p>
<p>At the event, Kim also announced Hyundai&#8217;s plans to launch two new hydrogen fuel cell powertrains in 2023, which the company hopes will help make hydrogen mainstream by 2040. The third generation of Hyundai&#8217;s hydrogen fuel stack will come in either 100 kW or 200kW outputs for either passenger cars or commercial vehicles, respectively.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Hyundai, Kia and Genesis, has one fuel cell bus on the market today, the Elec City Fuel Cell bus, with 115 buses live on the road in South Korea. The automaker also has one fuel cell truck, the Xcient Hyundai, on the market, 45 of which were launched in Switzerland last year.</span></p>
<p>Hyundai boasts a fuel-cell SUV, the NEXO, with plans to introduce the next model in 2023, alongside a hydrogen-powered multi-purpose vehicle model. The company announced at the IAA Mobility conference in Munich that it would also launch a large fuel cell-powered SUV after 2025, as well as four more commercial vehicles by the end of the decade. The company aims to provide fuel cell technology for different use cases, including emergency vehicles, ships, freights, trams, forklifts and other vehicles for industrial processes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Fuel cell is a proven technology that can deliver the benefits of hydrogen to people around the world in various fields,&#8221; said Kim. &#8220;Basically, a fuel cell is a power generator like an engine. It differs from a battery which stores electricity. A fuel cell system consists of a fuel cell stack that generates electricity, a hydrogen supply system, an air supply system and a thermal management system. It generates power by combining hydrogen and oxygen, similar to the engine of an internal combustion vehicle, but without the carbon emissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kim went onto explain that fuel cell systems produce energy through chemical reactions and operate as long as hydrogen fuel is supplied, unlike a battery which just passively stores energy. He said Hyundai is working on building up the necessary ecosystem to create success in the hydrogen space, including production, storage, fuel cell technology and infrastructure. Much of the infrastructure would be solar and wind sources that would produce the renewable energy needed to create clean power to split water into oxygen and &#8216;green&#8217; hydrogen.</p>
<p>Alongside its own research and development, Hyundai Motor has also already invested in hydrogen startups like H2Pro and has announced plans to establish green hydrogen infrastructures in countries with supportive governments and abundant renewable energy resources.</p>
<p>Much of the movement in this space comes after the group announced its commitment to become carbon neutral by 2045 and to reduce its emissions by 75% below 2019 levels by 2040. By 2030, Hyundai expects 30% of all vehicle sales to be zero emission, with battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles taking up 80% of total fleet sales by 2040.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francophone Africa has its first unicorn, and if you&#8217;ve been following tech on the continent, you will be very unsurprised to hear that it&#8217;s coming from the world of fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.wave.com/en/">Wave</a>, a U.S. and Senegal-based mobile money provider, has raised $200 million in Series A round of funding. The investment is the largest-ever Series A round for the region, and it values Wave at $1.7 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four big-name backers jointly led the round &#8212; Sequoia Heritage, a private investment fund and a subsidiary of Sequoia; Founders Fund; payments giant Stripe; and Ribbit Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others in the round include existing investors Partech Africa and Sam Altman, the former CEO of Y Combinator and current CEO of OpenAI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mobile money market in sub-Saharan Africa is growing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This past year, up to $500 billion has moved through the accounts of 300 million active mobile money users in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite being one of the largest alternative financial infrastructures known globally, this represents only a fraction of the overall market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Monetary Fund says that as of 2017, only 43% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa were &#8220;banked&#8221; by way of a traditional bank or mobile money account. When it comes to growing that proportion, however, m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obile money &#8212; based on simpler technology and with an easier onboarding process &#8212; wins out, and it is set to capture more market share faster than traditional banking in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And this has investors, especially foreign ones, excited and looking to get on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Neobanking, based on mobile technology too, falls somewhere in the middle of the two).</span></p>
<h2>From Sendwave to Wave</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re wondering why you haven&#8217;t heard of Wave, the reason might be because you don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s a spinoff from Africa-focused remittance provider Sendwave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk founded Sendwave in 2014 to offer little or no fee remittances from North America and Europe to select African and Asian countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The YC-backed company became a WorldRemit subsidiary last year when the global fintech paid up to $500 million in cash and stock for Sendwave.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198507" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198507" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?w=680" alt="Wave" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg 5479w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wave-founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198507" class="wp-caption-text">L-R: Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before that, the team </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stealthily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked on a mobile money product described as having no account fees and &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">instantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available and accepted everywhere</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the product was piloted as Wave in Senegal but it was still within the Sendwave ecosystem. When WorldRemit acquired Sendwave, Durbin and his team turned their focus to Wave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We saw an opportunity to make a bigger impact by trying to build a better, much more affordable mobile money service than the telcos are building throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa,&#8221; Durbin told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see any companies besides the telcos trying to solve that problem.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Going up against incumbents</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telecom operators and banks have been the early entrants in the mobile money space, not least because they control much of the infrastructure in the process, from having mobile subscribers using handsets on their networks through to building the financial services to manage money and payments at the back end, and everything in between. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party providers, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fintechs, have tried to capture some market share from these incumbents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wave, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, wants to disrupt it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durbin tells TechCrunch that unlike M-Pesa, the mobile payment provider led by Safaricom, and other products of telecom operators like Orange and Tigo, Wave is building a mobile money service that is &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">radically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affordable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dakar-based platform is akin to PayPal (with mobile money accounts, not bank accounts) and runs an agent network that uses their cash on hand to service Wave users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the company, users can make free deposits and withdrawals and charge a 1% fee whenever they send money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durbin says this is 70% cheaper than telecom-led mobile money and whenever there is a transfer problem, refunds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are made</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">instantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unlike with incumbents where users might need to wait for some days</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wave&#8217;s technology also differs from telecom-led mobile money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas the incumbents mostly focus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on USSD (although there are provisions to use applications), Wave is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app-based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For users without a smartphone, Wave also provides a free QR-card to transact with an agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By building its own infrastructure full-stack &#8212; agent network, agent and consumer applications, QR cards, business collections, and disbursements &#8212; Wave has been able to fuel its growth to several million monthly active users and billions of dollars in annual volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2198492" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198492" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2198492" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?w=680" alt="Wave" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg 8688w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WAVECI2895.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2198492" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wave</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year-old startup claims to be the largest mobile money player in Senegal and that over half of the country&#8217;s adults are active users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That pegs the number of users between 4 million and 5 million, and Wave wants to replicate this growth in Ivory Coast, the second market it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanded to last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sort of growth puts pressure on telecom operators. That has indeed been the case for the leading telecom operator in both regions, Orange. In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">June, the telecom operator stopped users in Senegal from purchasing Orange airtime via Wave&#8217;s mobile application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per this <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/97171/senegal-cote-divoire-wave-the-fintech-thats-shaking-up-the-mobile-money-industry/">report</a>, Wave argued that Orange was applying anti-competitive tactics by restricting it from selling </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or via an approved wholesaler</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Orange, on the other hand, said it had made proposals &#8220;in line with those offered to its other providers&#8221; and that Wave wanted special treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach a fair decision, both parties are working with the regulatory body in charge, Regulatory Authority for Telecommunications and Posts (RATP)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And if the regulator isn&#8217;t capable of settling the issue, BCEAO, the regional bank of Francophone countries, is next in line to resolve the dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Wave&#8217;s CEO, the bank&#8217;s regulatory approach is one reason why Wave has been able to take on the telecom operators in the first place. But among all the West African countries where mobile money is prevalent, why start with Senegal, an emerging market?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Senegal is a big enough market that we would have to work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hard to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> win the market. But also a small enough market that if we were doing well, we could win the market quicker than if we were in a giant country. And so that combination of those two things made it seem like a good place to start,&#8221; Durbin remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this fundraise, Wave will deepen its presence in Senegal and Ivory Coast and grow its already 800-strong team across product, engineering, and business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Wave will expand into other markets it feels are regulatory-friendly like Uganda</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s a pretty broad array of countries that have strong central banks and clear regulations are open to new players, or even want new players to come in and try to compete with the telcos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so we have a lot of licenses that are in progress, and we&#8217;ll </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">try to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prioritize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the countries where we&#8217;re able to get started sooner over the ones that it takes longer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>A unicorn after two rounds</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/97171/senegal-cote-divoire-wave-the-fintech-thats-shaking-up-the-mobile-money-industry/">reports</a> say Wave had raised $13.8 million prior to this, Durbin declined to comment on the figure when asked. However, he did mention</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Partech, the French outfit with an African fund, invested in a seed round alongside other investors like Founders Fund and Stripe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sequoia, Ribbit, and Sam Altman, the same crop of investors also participated in this monster Series A round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a market that has typically lacked innovation, Partech general partner Tidjane Deme says the investment will help Wave improve its service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since 2018, we&#8217;ve supported Wave because we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were convinced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile money is still an unsolved problem in Africa,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;Wave has great product design, stellar execution, and a strong financial trajectory. We are proud to see it become the first unicorn from Senegal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Sequoia Capital invested in Egyptian fintech Telda, its first big deal on the continent. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wave investment, meanwhile, is coming via subsidiary Sequoia Heritage and is the latter&#8217;s first investment in an Africa-focused startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a call with TechCrunch, Altman said that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wave ticked the boxes he considers before an investment &#8212; strong founders, an important problem in a large market, working product, and traction</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve known these founders for a long time, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they&#8217;re like off the charts good. I&#8217;ve been super impressed with their ability to figure out what users want and how to grow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company is solving the most important problem around money transfer in Africa and fixing the inefficient agent networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest venture rounds for any venture in Africa remain OPay&#8217;s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/african-fintech-opay-valued-at-2b-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-400m-funding/">$400 million fundraise</a> and Jumia&#8217;s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/03/rocket-internets-africa-internet-group-raises-326m-from-goldman-sachs-and-others/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equivalent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both were Series C rounds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next biggest rounds include Interswitch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">$200 million investment</a> from Visa and Flutterwave&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">$170 million Series C</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">these</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies attained unicorn status following their respective rounds. The same goes for Wave but more spectacularly, considering the company bagged it in a Series A round, it&#8217;s transcending the region and is one of the largest A-rounds globally this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wave joins OPay and Flutterwave as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> minted unicorns in Africa this year &#8212; that is, startups valued above $1 billion &#8212; and the fourth African unicorn after Interswitch. Other billion-dollar companies include publicly traded Jumia and Egyptian fintech Fawry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding rounds in Africa keep getting bigger and the continent has reached an inflection point. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some skeptics have questioned the valuations of previous unicorns; Wave wouldn&#8217;t be an exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument would be around why Wave commands such a high valuation when for instance, two prominent telecom operators, Airtel and MTN, are looking to list their mobile money businesses between $2 to $6 billion despite being in the operations for several years across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet like any investor optimistic about a portfolio company, Altman doesn&#8217;t believe Wave </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is overvalued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, he thinks the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is undervalued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The opportunity in front of the company is massive. But plenty of times, I&#8217;ve gotten it wrong, so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you never know. However, I have been fortunate to make </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> great investments and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wave has as good of a shot as you can ask for,&#8221; he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Africa is going to be the fastest growing and most important market over the next coming decades for many companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people are realizing how big the market opportunity is and how much value is going to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we&#8217;ll see a lot more things like this happen.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BP Ventures, the investing arm of oil and gas giant BP, has announced a €10 million (~$11.9 million) investment in Ryd, a German in-car digital payments provider. The fresh funds will help Ryd expand its service into international markets and build out its offering, according to a statement.</p>
<p>Ryd&#8217;s service allows users to lump together online payments for services like fuel purchases, EV charging and car washing via the startup&#8217;s app or integration with smart car systems. BP already offers digital payment options in the UK and the Netherlands through its BPme app. As part of its investment and partnership with Ryd, the legacy company hopes to expand its digital offerings as it learns from the startup&#8217;s secure and flexible digital payment options. Ryd will get the benefit of scaling its technology to BP customers across Europe.</p>
<p>“In-car digital payments are an integral part of the seamless and convenient experience that customers increasingly expect at our retail sites,&#8221; Alex Jensen, bp’s senior vice president mobility and convenience, Europe and Southern Africa, said in a statement. &#8220;Ryd’s technology can help deliver just that, and for an increasing range of services.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first bet BP is taking in the smart vehicle space, and it likely won&#8217;t be the last. In June,<a href="https://www.bp.com/en/global/bp-ventures/news/press-releases/bp-makes-seven-million-dollar-investment-in-electric-vehicle-charging-firm-iotecha.html"> the firm also invested $7 million in IoTecha</a>, a smart EV charging company that connects chargers with the electricity grid using IoT and automates charging payments. Strategic investments like these ultimately add to<a href="https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-strategy-update-2018-lamar-mckay-presentation.pdf"> BP Ventures&#8217;s ecosystem</a> which is designed to help BP reinvent itself as an integrated energy company, as well as help it reduce its carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Ryd is already accepted today at 3,000 partner service stations across seven countries, according to the company. It has 1.4 million direct customers, as well as access to up to 100 million additional customers through its partnerships with Mastercard and several car manufacturers. With the connected car data market expected to reach $19 billion globally by 2030, and the non-fuel retail sales market expected to reach <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/ie/pdf/2020/06/fuel-forecourt-retail-market.pdf">$285 billion globally by the same year,</a> the startup is now homing in on its strategy to integrate its tech into more vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Ryd we want to enable hassle-free and secure interactions with cars,&#8221; said Oliver Goetz, founder and chairman of Ryd, in a statement. &#8220;BP is the final piece to our puzzle and completes our ecosystem with strong strategic partners in all of our business areas: finance, automotive and energy. BP expects tens of millions of car drivers to move to direct digital payment systems, which are both connected to car data and to payment systems at gas stations and beyond. This new payment form is much faster, easier and more comfortable. Ryd is on its way to lead this movement in Europe.”</p>
<p>Ryd expects to go live at the first BP filling stations in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to Ryd&#8217;s CEO Sandra Dax.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian crypto exchange CoinSwitch Kuber is in advanced stages of talks to raise a new financing round at up to $2 billion in valuation, several sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>If the talks materialize in a deal, CoinSwitch Kuber will become the second crypto startup in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market to attain the unicorn status.</p>
<p>The four-year-old startup, which counts Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, and Ribbit Capital among its existing investors, was valued at over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/tiger-global-backs-indian-crypto-startup-coinswitch-kuber-at-over-500m-valuation/">$500 million valuation in its Series B</a> financing round in April this year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear who is positioning to lead the round. The firm has engaged closely with Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase in recent weeks, several people aware of those discussions told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A deal may finalize within this month, sources said. The size of the deal, according to one source, is over $100 million. Usual caveats apply: terms of the proposed deal may change or the talks may not result in a deal.</p>
<p>The startup declined to comment. Coinbase and A16z, which has yet to back any Indian startup, did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India did not respond to a request for comment last week.</p>
<p>The investment talks come at a time when CoinSwitch Kuber has almost doubled its userbase in recent months &#8212; even as local authorities push back against crypto assets. Its eponymous app had over 7 million monthly active users in India last month, up from about 4 million in April this year, according to mobile insight platform App Annie (data of which an industry exec shared with TechCrunch).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>B Capital backed CoinDCX, a rival of CoinSwitch Kuber that has amassed 3.5 million users, last month in a $90 million round that valued CoinDCX at about $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Policymakers in India have been debating on the status of digital currencies in the South Asian market for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">several years</a>. India&#8217;s central bank, Reserve Bank of India, has expressed concerns about private virtual currencies though it is planning to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/india-considering-phased-roll-out-of-central-bank-digital-currency/">run trial programs of its first digital currency</a> as soon as December.</p>
<p>More than two dozen Indian startups have become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year, as several high-profile investors, including Tiger Global, SoftBank and Falcon Edge, have increased the pace of their investments in the South Asian market. TechCrunch reported last week that Tiger Global is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiger-global-in-talks-to-make-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">engaging with Apna</a> to fund a new round that values the 21-month-old Indian firm at over $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Financial services, especially those for people who don’t have access to traditional bank accounts or lines of credit, <a href="https://finovate.com/southeast-asias-fintech-boom-all-you-need-to-know/">are proliferating in Southeast Asia</a>. Jeff App wants to give consumers a “super app” where they can compare many financial products and apply for them using the startup’s proprietary data-scoring models. For service providers, Jeff serves as a distribution channel, helping them find and retain customers. The startup announced today it has raised a seed extension of $1.5 million, led by J12 Ventures. Other participants included iSeed Ventures and Toy Ventures, and returning investors EstBAN, Startup Wise Guys and other angels.</p>
<p>The funding brings Jeff’s total raised to about $2.5 million. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jeff-raises-1m-to-build-alternative-credit-scoring-and-other-fintech-products-for-southeast-asia/">announced a $1 million seed round back in March</a>. Founder and chief executive officer Tom Niparts told TechCrunch that Jeff had a net profitable second quarter and wasn&#8217;t planning on raising again, but investors were interested because of its strong growth since the beginning of the year. The startup claims that since the end of January, its users have tripled to 700,000, who compared a total of four million products over the past six months.</p>

<p>Founded in 2019, the startup is operational in Vietnam and has applied for a license to launch in Indonesia. It also plans to enter the Philippines in the third quarter. Part of the funding will be used to increase Jeff’s team from about 15 people now to more than 40 employees for its offices in Latvia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Before launching Jeff, Niparts was CEO of Spain for Digital Finance International, a fintech company that is part of the Finstar Financial Group. During that time, Niparts saw that in many Southeast Asian countries, people struggled to get loans not because of their credit history or income, but because they simply didn’t have enough personal financial data. Jeff was created to develop alternative data scoring models for financial services.</p>
<p>Niparts said Jeff’s goal is to become a main distribution channel for financial services in Southeast Asia and the top place for consumers to compare products and apply for them.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Jeff enjoyed strong growth during the first half of this year was by honing its user acquisition strategy in Vietnam. At first, it relied on global channels for user acquisition, like Google and Facebook ads, but now its top acquisition channel is through partnering with local affiliates, including bloggers and social media influencers who have grown considerable followings with educational content about finances.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“What we were surprised about is that in Europe, for instance, TikTok would never work for financial services, but in Vietnam we saw that it is a pretty amazing channel,” said Niparts.</p>
<p>While one of Jeff’s main features is loan comparison, the company has started expanding its offerings because most people only borrow money once in a while.</p>
<p>To create incentives to return to Jeff, instead of offloading the app once they secure a loan, Jeff is also offering coupons, like Shopee discounts and planning to launch telecom top-ups with cashback offers and a user referral functionality. It is also working on neobank and mobile wallet comparisons, payment functionalities, installment financing, services for micro-to small-sized merchants and a data science model to increase conversions for providers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every startup founder faces the same issue — how do you manage your cap table and equity plans in a transparent and lightweight manner? If you’re based in the U.S., chances are you’re using an equity management solution like <a href="https://carta.com">Carta</a>. But if you’re not based in the U.S., you don’t have a ton of options.</p>
<p><a href="https://ledgy.com">Ledgy</a> wants to become the ownership management tool for the rest of the world. Based in Switzerland, several well-known European startups are already using Ledgy, such as Wefox, Kry, Bitpanda, Gorillas and Trade Republic.</p>
<p>The company recently closed a $10 million Series A funding round led by Sequoia Capital. Other investors in the round include Xavier Niel, Harry Stebbings, Visionaries Club, UiPath&#39;s Daniel Dines and Front&#39;s Mathilde Collin. Some of Ledgy’s existing investors also invested once again, such as Myke Näf, Paul Sevinç, btov Partners, Creathor Ventures and VI Partners.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when Ledgy co-founder and CEO Yoko Spirig talked with an entrepreneur, the founder showed her how he managed ownership. He opened an Excel spreadsheet and scrolled, scrolled, scrolled… “Each line represented a share. You can imagine how error-prone it is,” she told me.</p>
<p>While the implementation was odd, most companies in Europe are still using Excel spreadsheets to manage ownership. And Ledgy wants to convince those companies that switching to a software solution that has been specifically designed to solve this issue could be beneficial.</p>
<p>“The key has really been to focus on the software infrastructure. What we do is that we have implemented automation workflows that are adaptable depending on countries,” Spirig said. “We’re not focusing on one regulation and we’re really offering the infrastructure layer,” she added.</p>
<p>That’s why Ledgy already supports 32 countries. It has tweaked its product even more specifically for Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There will be more country-specific releases in the near future for startups based in the U.K. and France. 1,500 companies are using Ledgy right now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When you switch to Ledgy, there are three main advantages. First, like other software-as-a-service products, Ledgy acts as a single source of truth for all stakeholders — the HR team, the finance team, investors, lawyers and employees.</p>
<p>The second selling point is that you can automate some of the most tedious tasks. For instance, Ledgy can automatically generate documents based on templates and different variables. Signed documents are stored on Ledgy. You can export data every quarter or every year for compliance reasons.</p>
<p>Third, it fosters transparency across the company. Employees can check the value of their options. They can see how much their options could be worth if the leadership team is in the process of raising a new round of funding.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Ledgy plans to expand into new markets. The company also plans to roll out support for public companies so that some of its existing customers can go public and keep using Ledgy.</p>

<p>For many manufacturers and freight forwarders, managing logistics is still a very manual process: tracking shipments with a call or online lookup, and entering that data into an Excel spreadsheet. <a href="https://portcast.io/">Portcast</a>, which describes itself as a “next-generation logistics operating system,” makes the process more efficient by gathering data from myriad sources and not only track shipments in real-time, but also predicts what might affect its progress, like major weather events, the tide and pandemic-related issues.</p>
<p>The company announced today it has raised $3.2 million in pre-Series A funding, led by Newtown Partners, through the Imperial Venture Fund, with participation from Wavemaker Partners, TMV, Innoport and SGInnovate. Based in Singapore, Portcast serves clients in Asia and Europe, and will use part of its funding to expand into more markets.</p>
<p>Co-founders Nidhi Gupta and Dr. Lingxiao Xia met at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/entrepreneur-first-eyes-further-asia-growth/">Entrepreneur First in Singapore</a>. Before launching Portcast, Gupta, its chief executive officer, served in leadership roles across Asia at DHL. During that time, she realized the logistic sector’s “inefficiencies are actually an opportunity in this space to create something.” Dr. Xia, who holds a PhD in machine learning and has a background in product development and cloud computing, “was a great complementary fit” and is now Portcast’s chief technology officer.</p>
<p>Portcast says it tracks more than 90% of world trade volume that travels by ocean carriers, and 35% of air cargo, and can forecast demand for 30,000 trade routes. Sources include geospatial data, like satellite data about where ships are, what speed and direction they’re moving in, what ports they are headed for, wind speed and wave height. Portcast also looks at economic patterns (for example, Brexit’s impact on ports around the United Kingdom, and how vaccine rollouts around the world changes airline and ship capacity), weather events like typhoon and disruptions like the Suez Canal blockage.</p>

<p>Other data sources include proprietary transactional data from customers including large shipping companies and freight forwarders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The challenge for us is how do we let all of this data speak the same language,” Gupta told TechCrunch. “This data is coming in at different frequencies, different granularities, so how do you consolidate that and make sure the machine can start understanding it and interpreting it.”</p>
<p>Portcast’s two main solutions are currentlu Intelligent Container Visibility for real-time tracking of shipment containers, and Forecasting and Demand Management, which tracks booking patterns. Portcast doesn’t use IoT to track containers since it is cost-prohibitive to place a device in every one, but is working with IoT providers on hybrid solutions—for example, putting a tracking device in one container and then using that data to help manage the rest of the shipment.</p>
<p>The startup’s goal is to make predictions that help companies improve the efficiency of their operations, and reduce their reliance on manual processes. “There are logistics operators with hundreds of cargo coming in every single week, they’re going and checking this manually every day. That goes into an Excel sheet and that’s what the planning of downstream operations is based off of,” said Gupta.</p>
<p>But the COVID-19 pandemic created an “urgent need to digitize, and it’s transformed supply chains from being a cost function to the core of getting products on time, so we work with some of the largest manufacturers as well as freight forwarders,” she added. For example, a food and beverage company in Europe sent a shipment to Taipei, a trip that usually takes about 70 days. But it took more than three months to arrive. Portcast was able to track the shipment as it moved across different ports and ships, helping its customers understand what caused the delay.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">“Besides just predicting when there will be a likely disruption, we’re able to pinpoint and say there’s a delay of X days because there will likely be a typhoon or a transshipment, and that empowers them because they can tell their trucking and warehousing teams how many containers are going to come in,” said Gupta. “This reduces port fees, detention charges and the number of hours spent on manually checking different company’s websites and trying to figure out what happened to their supply chain.”</span></p>
<p>One of Portcast’s advantages over other logistics tech startups that want to fix supply chain visibility is that it launched out of the Asia-Pacific region, where ships usually go through multiple ports and have to work around frequent weather events like tropical storms and typhoons. The technology Portcast developed to create shorter voyages between Singapore and Malaysia (for example) is also applicable to intercontinental routes like Asia and Europe, or Asia and the United States.</p>
<p>“Our technology is global in scale and that allows us to compete against other players in this market,” said Gupta. “The other thing that differentiates us is that we work not just with manufacturers, but also with shipping companies, logistics companies and cargo airlines, and that allows us to create network effects. There is a really strong synergy between what’s happening in ocean freight and air freight, and that allows us to understand patterns in the industry and creates leverage for any other company that comes onto our platform.</p>
<p>Portcast’s future plans include moving from predictive AI to include prescriptive AI within the next two quarters. Right now, the platform can tell companies what is causing delays, but prescriptive AI will also enable it to make automated suggestions. For example, it can tell clients what ports are faster, other ships and modes of transport that can help them get around a disruption and how to optimize their capacity.</p>
<p>The company is also planning to launch Order Visiblity by the end of this year, a feature that will track containers filled with a specific item. Consumer prices for many different kinds of products are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/consumer-prices-rising-cpi-heres-whats-increasing-the-most-and-why/">rising, due in part to overwhelmed supply chains</a>. By enabling companies to track specific SKUs in real-time, Portcast can not only help items arrive more quickly, but also show how much CO2 emissions each shipment creates.</p>
<p>“Carbon offsetting or carbon trading can only happen once you have visibility into how much you are actually spending, and that’s the piece we can get involved in,” said Gupta. “By allowing predictions like, for example, if you will arrive early, that’s an opportunity for a shipping company to slow down and save fuel like bunker fuel, which not only brings an immense amount of savings, but also reduces CO2 emissions.</p>
