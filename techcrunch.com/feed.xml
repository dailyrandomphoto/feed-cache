It&#8217;s the same free-to-start MOBA with the same maps and monsters the launched on the Nintendo Switch in July, though the <em>Pokémon Unite</em> team recently rolled out a new update in preparation for its mobile debut. In a <a href="https://unite.pokemon.com/en-us/news/producer-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">post</a>on the game&#8217;s official website, producer Masaaki Hoshino detailed the new features, starting with full cross-platform support and account linking capability across mobile devices and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>The game has also introduced Unite Squads, which allow Trainers to team up with squadmates. According to The Pokémon Company, Trainers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22685804/pokemon-unite-mobile-launch-ios-android-battle-pass-squads" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">can create</a>their own squads with this feature or search for existing ones. Teams will be able to use &#8220;tags&#8221; to describe themselves to give people with the same interests a way to find them. The update brings a second battle pass with all-new cosmetic items, new in-game events, new held items and support for more languages, as well.</p>
<p>Hoshino has also mentioned in the post that the team is currently developing a new mode designed &#8220;to level the playing field for all Trainers, regardless of their held items’ grades.&#8221; While Hoshino didn&#8217;t expound on the new mode, it could give people who don&#8217;t spend a lot of money (if at all) to buy held items on the game a bigger chance to win against others who do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV startup Workhorse Group is recalling 41 of its C-1000 cargo delivery vehicles and suspending the remainder of its deliveries for this model, telling regulators Wednesday that “additional testing” is needed to certify the vehicles under Federal safety standards.</p>
<p>All automakers must certify their vehicles under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, minimum safety performance requirements issued by the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). The additional testing should be completed in the fourth quarter, the company told the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001425287/000121390021049277/ea147777-8k_workhorse.htm">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p>
<p>The company also filed a safety recall report with NHTSA, and noted that it had not received any customer reporters of safety issues relating to the C-1000.</p>
<p>Ohio-based Workhorse has been in the news lately, primarily for filing a legal complaint against the U.S. Postal Service for awarding a multi-billion dollar contract for electric delivery vehicles to defense contractor Oshkosh. The EV startup dismissed its challenge voluntarily last week.</p>
<p>Losing the USPS contract doesn’t mark the end of its woes. The SEC also opened an investigation into Workhorse at the beginning of September, though the regulator hasn’t disclosed what the investigation concerns. The company appointed CEO Richard Dauch to replace Duane Hughes in July.</p>
<p>The notice from Workhorse sent its shares tumbling by around 10%.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to both Workhorse and NHTSA and will update the story if they respond.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today provided an update on how Apple&#8217;s privacy changes have impacted its ad business. The company had <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FB-Q2-2021-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">already warned</a> investors during its second quarter earnings that it expected to feel an even more significant impact in its ad targeting business by Q3. This morning, it reiterated that point, but also noted that it had been underreporting iOS web conversions by approximately 15%, which had led advertisers to believe the impact was even worse than they had expected.</p>
<p>According to Facebook&#8217;s announcement <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/navigating-change-and-improving-performance-and-measurement">published</a> to its business blog, this exact percentage could vary broadly among individual advertisers. But it said the real-world conversions, including things like sales and app installs, are likely higher than what advertisers are seeing when using Facebook&#8217;s analytics.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s stock has dropped by nearly 4% on this news, as of the time of writing.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Facebook has shared misleading metrics. In the past, however, it had inflated its video ad metrics and didn&#8217;t quickly act to correct the problem, leading to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/facebook-knew-ad-metrics-were-inflated-but-ignored-the-problem-lawsuit-claims.html">a class-action lawsuit</a>. In this case, however, the issue with the metrics isn&#8217;t making Facebook look better than it is, but worse. The company noted it&#8217;s been hearing from its advertising community that they are seeing a larger-than-planned impact to their ad investments on the network, raising concerns.</p>
<p>Facebook offered advertisers a few tips to help them better understand a campaign&#8217;s impact and performance in this new era. It suggested waiting a minimum of 72 hours or the full length of the optimization window before evaluating performance rather than making assessments on a daily basis, as before. It also said advertisers should analyze reporting at the campaign level, when possible, as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/micro_site/url/?click_creative_path[0]=link&amp;click_from_context_menu=true&amp;country=US&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F311705270326952&amp;event_type=click&amp;last_nav_impression_id=038HUuAMQx3vR9ZtP&amp;max_percent_page_viewed=34&amp;max_viewport_height_px=845&amp;max_viewport_width_px=1680&amp;orig_http_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2F&amp;orig_request_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fnews%2Fnavigating-change-and-improving-performance-and-measurement&amp;primary_cmsid=4298554343565860&amp;primary_content_locale=en_US&amp;region=noam&amp;scrolled=true&amp;session_id=1BlWFa01oHOpSUeWp&amp;site=fb4b&amp;extra_data[view_type]=v3_initial_view&amp;extra_data[site_section]=news&amp;extra_data[placement]=%2Fbusiness%2Fnews%2Fnavigating-change-and-improving-performance-and-measurement&amp;extra_data[creative_detail]=FBBHelp_SomeEstimatedConversions">some estimated conversations</a> are reported with a delay. And it suggested advertisers choose web events (like a purchase or sign-up) that are most aligned with their core business, among other things.</p>
<p>To address the issues with improving its measurements, Facebook said it&#8217;s working to improve its conversion modeling, accelerating its investments to address reporting gaps, launching new capabilities to track web conversions, and extending its ability to measure in-app conversions in apps that have already been installed. The company said it would work quickly to fix bugs, including one that recently had led to underreporting of approximately 10%, which was previously shared with advertisers.</p>
<p>The company in August explained how it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/building-for-the-future">working</a> to adapt its personalized ads business in light of both Apple and Google&#8217;s privacy changes and the new regulatory landscape, but those efforts will take time, it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Outside of the ad tech updates themselves, Facebook has also been working on new products that would allow advertisers to better position themselves in front of consumers browsing Facebook&#8217;s apps. Just last week, for instance, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-revamps-its-business-tool-lineup-following-threats-to-its-ad-targeting-business/">revamped its business tool lineup</a> with the introduction of new features and expansions of smaller tests that would offer businesses more ways to be discovered. One such test in the U.S. would direct consumers to other businesses and topics directly underneath news feed posts. It also now allows businesses to add WhatsApp buttons to their Instagram profiles and create ads that send Instagram users to WhatsApp business chats.</p>
<p>Facebook has been warning advertisers for some time that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">Apple’s new privacy features</a>, which allow mobile users to opt out of being tracked across their iOS apps, would cause issues for the way its ad targeting business typically operated. And it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/"> repeatedly argued that Apple’s changes</a> would impact small businesses that relied on Facebook ads to reach their customers. When the changes went into effect, Facebook&#8217;s concerns were validated as <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">studies found</a> very few consumers are opting into tracking on iOS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Toast and Freshworks both raised their IPO ranges and priced above the raised interval. If you are looking for an indication that it's a good time to go public, this is it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that Klarna is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/really-this-market-isnt-good-enough/">waiting for more favorable market conditions</a> before going public felt a little odd yesterday. Today, hesitation to go public feels downright strange. New pricing information from U.S. tech unicorn Toast and Indian tech unicorn Freshworks indicate that the IPO market is more than welcoming.</p>

<p>Toast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/toast-raises-ipo-price-range-providing-a-monday-bump-to-fintech-valuations/">raised its IPO range</a> and priced above that raised interval. Freshworks also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/freshworks-valuation-could-crest-10b-in-upcoming-ipo/">bumped up its IPO price expectations</a> and then priced above <em>that</em> set of price targets.</p>

Sure, both companies have yet to start trading, but even flat debuts would represent strong fundraising tallies and strong upward mobility in valuation terms.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re going to run the final numbers, calculating how much the companies are worth and what those figures say about startup prices, especially in the payments space. And then we&#8217;ll close with one of the more humorous answers I&#8217;ve ever gotten from a startup executive. Sound good? Let&#8217;s talk money.</p>
<h2>Freshworks, Toast price well</h2>
<p>Toast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/toast-looks-toward-18b-valuation-in-upcoming-ipo/">first targeted</a> an IPO range of between $30 and $33 per share. The company then looked toward a $34 to $36 per share IPO price. It finally sold 21,739,131 shares <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921006179/en/Toast-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $40 apiece</a>, with its underwriters having the option to purchase another 3,260,869 shares at its IPO price if they so choose. The company&#8217;s IPO fundraise could be worth as much as $1.0 billion in its debut.</p>
<p>Freshworks set its IPO price range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/freshworks-aims-for-nearly-9-billion-valuation-in-us-ipo/">between $28 and $32 per share</a>. That didn&#8217;t last, with the customer support software company raising its range to between $32 and $34 per share. Freshworks <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/freshworks-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-301382238.html">priced at $36</a> per share, selling 28,500,000 shares with an underwriter option of 2,850,000 more shares. The company&#8217;s IPO fundraise could be worth as much as $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Recall that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/">Renaissance Capital</a> valued Toast at $17.9 billion at $31.50 per share (the midpoint of its first IPO range), and Freshworks at $9.6 billion at $30 per share (again, the midpoint of its first IPO pricing interval), both calculated with <em>fully </em>diluted share counts. Simple math indicates that Toast is worth around $22.7 billion at its IPO price, and Freshworks at $11.5 billion, again using fully diluted share counts.</p>
<p>You will see lower numbers out there, likely calculated using a simple &#8212; more conservative &#8212; share count. Those are also valid.</p>
<p>In revenue multiple terms, Toast&#8217;s and Freshworks&#8217; final IPO prices are good news for the companies. With $424.7 million in Q2 revenues, Toast is worth 13.4x its annual run rate. Freshworks is worth 32.5x its own run rate. The differential that we see there is the difference between the two companies&#8217; business models. Toast is a majority payments/fintech company, while Freshworks is a more pure-play SaaS company. SaaS has stronger gross margins than payments revenues &#8212; and is stickier (i.e., recurring) than transaction incomes. So, it gets a higher multiple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airlines have a relatively straightforward goal &#8212; getting people in seats &#8212; but they’ve traditionally relied on inefficient and outdated statistical modeling methods to predict what prices and other conditions will sell tickets.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://flyrlabs.com/">FLYR Labs</a>. The company has developed a deep learning platform to forecast airline demand and set airfare prices, and it’s now secured $150 million in Series C funding to grow both its core business and expand into other verticals.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2013 by Alex Mans, Cyril Guiraud and Jean Tripier, originally started as a consumer-focused platform. It offered a product called FareKeep that let travelers lock in the price of a ticket for a week, for a fee (TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/flyr-raised-8-million-to-change-the-way-we-buy-plane-tickets/">wrote about it</a> back in 2017). Then, in 2019, the company made a hard pivot away from consumer into B2B, in part because of interest from airlines.</p>
<p>“We realized that these traditional forecasting and pricing systems that airlines used to use […] they only used inventory levels and booking arrivals as an indicator of demand, and they only used relatively simplistic forms of regression forecasting to draw the line from recent history into the future,” Mans told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The problem with that method, according to FLYR, is that the entire forecast is thrown off when a new variable is introduced, like a new competitor entering the market, for example.</p>
<p>“We were very surprised how little data directly feeds that decision-making, how simplistic their models were,” he added.</p>

<p>FLYR Labs has developed a deep learning platform called “Revenue Operating System” that ingests a whole host of data provided by the airline &#8212; bookings, accounting data, searches, capacity &#8212; as well as information like weather or promotions to predict demand, revenue and, most importantly, to set the price of the airline ticket that the consumer ultimately sees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also uses competitor schedules and capacity to inform its modeling, which is purchased from third-party sources. (FLYR doesn’t train its model for any individual customer using their competitor’s data, so one airline using the company’s service wouldn’t have to worry about its historical data being used to strengthen another airline’s revenues.) From all these sources, the model is able to understand trends &#8212; even across routes or flight times &#8212; that can then inform new flights that have never been flown by the airline before.</p>
<p>Because the system across airline customers is trying to solve for the same problem &#8212; how do I price a seat so that it will sell? &#8212; the model will get smarter over time, FLYR says.</p>
<p>The company estimates it is able to increase the revenue of airlines by 5-7%, and the company does so not by just raising prices across the board, Mans said. “We create opportunities, both lower and higher priced, in the market that overall increases revenue,” he said. He added that 70-80% of travelers pay the same or less than they would under airlines’ legacy forecasting system.</p>
<p>FLYR offers a relatively low-risk onboarding process for new customers, deploying its software and going live with it on a subset of the airline’s network, generally 20-40%. It then conducts an A/B test for around 3-4 months to prove that its platform increases revenue, and takes its payment as a percentage of that incremental revenue performance.</p>
<p>FLYR’s methods have started to pay off: the company has around $14 billion in airline revenue under management, meaning it sets the ticket prices for that amount of revenues. While the startup is staying mum on its specific customers, it anticipates managing around $100 billion of airline revenues by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>That explosive growth forecasting is reflected in the company’s actual growth over the past 12 months. FLYR is opening up three new offices in Los Angeles, Dallas and Amsterdam in September, October and November respectively, in addition to its headquarters in San Francisco and an engineering office in Krakow, Poland. Its workforce has grown from about 50 people nine months ago to 150 today, and it plans on adding another 100 by January. In all, 80% of its workforce will be in engineering and data science, Mans said.</p>
<p>Once FLYR started seeing traction with airlines, it started getting calls &#8212; from car rental companies, cruise lines, railway companies, even events businesses interested in FLYR’s platform. Mans realized that the data these travel and transportation companies work with, as well as what they’re optimizing for, is not so dissimilar to that of airlines. So growing into neighboring verticals will be a huge focus for the company looking to 2022, he said.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the company’s also aiming to scale the capacity of its product. As Mans put it, “We realized that we&#8217;re not just a pricing system.” He said that better forecasting can help companies understand “when to add or remove capacity, or where to spend your marketing dollars to have higher yielding returns, or for the executive team to understand earlier how the quarter has gone.”</p>
<p>The funding round was led by WestCap, with participation from Silver Lake Waterman, WndrCo, as well as Peter Thiel, Streamlined Ventures, JetBlue Technology Ventures and Gopher Asset Management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ironcladapp.com/">Ironclad</a>, a startup that helps legal teams manage and coordinate contracts in a digital context, announced the hiring of two new executives today.</p>
<p>For starters, the company is bringing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lseka/">Leyla Seka</a> as COO. Seka was most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/operator-collective-brings-diversity-and-inclusion-to-enterprise-investing/">a partner at Operator Collective</a>, and prior to that spent more than decade at Salesforce, where she helped launch the Salesforce AppExchange. In addition, the company has hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-wang-0677bb4/">Helen Wang</a> as the company&#8217;s first chief financial officer. Wang spent the previous seven years at eBay, most recently as CFO of Global Payments.</p>
<p>Seka, who is also a founder at the Black Venture Institute and on the board of Girls Who Code, says that she had been working with Ironclad in her capacity as an investor, and had known Ironclad CEO and co-founder Jason Boehmig for years. Recently she had been helping him find a new COO and they had a candidate in mind who was waffling about accepting the offer. That&#8217;s when she casually dropped the idea about hiring her instead.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Q6ipLvmKWL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/operator-collective-brings-diversity-and-inclusion-to-enterprise-investing/">Operator Collective brings diversity and inclusion to enterprise investing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Operator Collective brings diversity and inclusion to enterprise investing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/operator-collective-brings-diversity-and-inclusion-to-enterprise-investing/embed/#?secret=Q6ipLvmKWL" data-secret="Q6ipLvmKWL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I said to Jason, &#8216;I don&#8217;t understand why someone wouldn&#8217;t want to come build a sure thing. I don&#8217;t get it.&#8217; And as I said this [I was thinking], &#8216;Leyla why don&#8217;t you build this sure thing. What are you doing?!&#8217; I just really flippantly said something like, &#8216;I should come help you do this,'&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Boehmig jumped at that idea and the two began a series of meetings to discuss what that would really look like. Seka said she saw something in Ironclad that she wanted to be a part of. That&#8217;s a 7 year old software company that has raised $184 million along the way. Today it has 300 employees and 1000 customers. And, more importantly for her, it has the kind of energy she says that she hadn&#8217;t seen since her early days at Salesforce when it was a much smaller company than it is today.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, she admitted that as much as she had enjoyed her time as a venture capitalist, she missed being in the center of building a business. &#8220;I realized not only did I miss the work, I missed the community and being part of a company. I derive a lot of value from being with other people and working towards a big goal like that,&#8221; she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two came to an agreement over the ensuing months and in a final meeting Boehmig, who has a passion for vinyl records, gave Seka the offer to be COO in a copy of the Grateful Dead&#8217;s Live Europe &#8217;72 album.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206587" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206587" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2206587" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?w=680" alt="Grateful Dead, Live Europe '72 album cover with offer in it ." width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg 4030w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Offer.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206587" class="wp-caption-text">Grateful Dead, Live Europe &#8217;72 album cover with offer in it.

<p>Wang on the other hand came through a more conventional search as the company was looking for an experienced CFO and she fit the bill. &#8220;We ran a search and we had all of these candidates and Helen was clearly the best candidate. So it&#8217;s actually interesting to compare the two processes. With Leyla, I wasn&#8217;t interviewing COOs. It wasn&#8217;t really an open role at the company, but it just kind of organically happened. And here we are,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Wang says that she approaches the job strategically. &#8220;It&#8217;s my job is to tell you how much revenue we brought in last month. It&#8217;s part of my job to tell you how much something costs, but my job is really helping my operating partners make bigger core decisions faster,&#8221; she said. In her view that means &#8220;using the P&amp;L (profit and loss statement) as a bit of a North Star to help us make better decisions that will benefit the company, benefit our customers, and ultimately our stakeholders.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Boehmig recognizes that unfortunately female executives remain a rarity in Silicon Valley, he sees that blind spot as something that he can take advantage of to bring the best and the brightest into his company. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to say I&#8217;m bringing in Helen and Leyla for some like idealistic reasons, and I&#8217;m happy about the idealistic reasons &#8212; I believe in this and it&#8217;s great &#8212; but we&#8217;re hiring them because they&#8217;re the best in the world at what they do &#8212; and they are,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Wang has been in the position for a couple of months now. Seka, who will remain Chair of the Board of Advisors at Operator Collective, is still in the process of coming and board, a process that should be complete in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Armstrong clearly would prefer if there were an overarching federal framework that would alleviate the burden of dealing with independent state-by-state rules and agencies.

<p>Coinbase recently clashed with the SEC after teasing the launch of a &#8216;Lend&#8217; product that would allow its users to stake their crypto holdings in exchange for a return in the form of yearly interest. The SEC threatened to sue over the product since it signalled that this would represent a security, and be regulated as such, and C<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/following-sec-lawsuit-threat-coinbase-cancels-launch-of-lend-product/">oinbase quietly walked back its plans to debut the product for now shortly after making public the SEC&#8217;s threat and articulating its lack of comprehension about the potential regulatory backlash</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video is at the heart of how people use the internet today, and creators are at the heart of what is being made and watched on video. Today, a startup that has built a platform that helps them produce and monetize their work is announcing a big round of funding that underscores just how lucrative and big the creator economy has become.</p>
<p><a href="https://streamelements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StreamElements</a>, which provides production and analytics tools to people who livestream and make video-on-demand for platforms like Amazon&#8217;s Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook, has raised $100 million in funding &#8212; money that it will be using to continue building out the tools on its platform, to do more in on-demand alongside a big business in livestreaming, and for marketing, specifically to bring more creators to its platform, which is already being used by 1.1 million people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to be everywhere creators are, which means expanding to new platforms, such as using the new funds to build out our presence on Trovo,&#8221; said co-founder Gil Hirsch. &#8220;It also means going beyond the livestreaming space and bringing our proprietary audience experience-driven technology to YouTube videos where we are creating some industry firsts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company competes against a wide swathe of others in the so-called creator economy, including many of the video platforms themselves building their own production and monetization features, so the race for more talent is not a small one.</p>
<p>In keeping with that, to sharpen up their business focus, alongside the funding news, the Tel-Aviv/Los Angeles-based company is also announcing some significant executive changes. Co-founder Gil Hirsch is taking on the role of CEO, with co-founder <span class="s1">Doron Nir (who had been the CEO up to now) moving over to president. Yuval Tal as COO, Jason Krebs as CBO, and Udi Hoffmann as CFO are rounding out the executive bench. (The other two co-founders are Or Perry and Reem Sherman.)</span></p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is leading this latest round, which also includes new backers PayPal Ventures and MoreTech; as well as previous investors <span class="s1">State of Mind Ventures, Pitango, Menorah, and Mivtach Shamir. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">StreamElements is not disclosing its valuation, but this round is coming in the wake of very strong growth for the company, after a prolonged period where user-generated video consumption went through the roof. That was not just because of the popularity of apps like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube (now with <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-gaming-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 million gaming channels</a>, among other content) and Twitch (which passed <em>2 billion</em> hours of watched video in January 2021); but also because video became a pastime and lifeline for many people after other activities and sometimes even movement outside of the house became restricted after the rise of Covid-19.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic had a massive impact on our business,&#8221; Hirsch said in an emailed interview with me. &#8220;In addition to people in quarantine watching more content, more people started creating it. We know this because our monthly users went from a couple hundred thousand before the quarantine and less than a year later it is now over a million. In addition, brands had to move their marketing spends from in-person events to digital campaigns with livestreamers becoming more appealing as a promotional vehicle. As a result, we regularly hear from major brands more frequently about coordinating influencer-driven sponsorship activations since that is our specialty.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of StreamElements, the company said usage of its platform grew 233%, and it has especially seen some strong traction with some of the more popular creators. It said that over 60% of the top content creators &#8212; those with 20,000 or more views and followers across multiple platforms &#8212; use the  StreamElements dashboard.</p>
<p>While StreamElements has made its name up to now mostly with livestreaming and working with, say, gamers on platforms like Twitch to help them produce content, manage conversations, and build in ways of making money, it&#8217;s now looking to focus more attention on video-on-demand, the company said &#8212; an area where it had already provided some services but will be doubling down to address what it sees as an untapped opportunity, especially in contrast to livestreaming.</p>
<p class="p8">“YouTube currently has over <span class="s2">40 million active gaming channels</span>, making it the largest gaming platform in the world,” said Hirsch in a statement. “The bulk of this content [is] on-demand videos, which lack the real-time engagement functionality that has driven the success of the livestreamed market. We are focused on infusing on demand videos with dynamic interactive features to strengthen the communities around this type of content.”</p>
<p>Notably, currently, StreamElements&#8217; creator tools are 100% free to use, so as Hirsch described it to me, &#8220;The primary way we generate revenue is through brand partnerships. We offer influencer-driven sponsorship activations that rely on our proprietary technology which already powers the majority of the top creators’ channels and enables unparalleled depth in terms of the measurement brands are looking for.&#8221; This is one reason why the company is going to focus on bringing more of these high-volume creators to its platform. Currently, he said the majority of its creators are based in US, Europe, and Brazil although the aim will be to continue to tap more people in more markets internationally, a mass market play that is exactly the kind of business SoftBank likes to back.</p>
<p class="p8">“As online entertainment continues to develop as an immersive experience, the demand for authentic creator-driven content has grown exponentially,&#8221; said Nahoko Hoshino, a senior investor for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “Through a suite of broadcasting and engagement tools, StreamElements is helping creators deliver an enriched experience for audiences while monetizing content from the most popular social video platforms. This creates an exciting, new digital market between creators and fans, and we’re thrilled to be working with the company in building engagement across an ever-widening global community.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Longer term, it will be interesting to see how and where StreamElements develops, and whether it chooses to invest in its own streaming platform, or indeed if one of the big ones acquires it.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">&#8220;We are more focused on ubiquity than being aligned solely with one platform because we see transcendent creators as the future,&#8221; Hirsch said. &#8220;This is a person whose personal brand is more powerful than any one platform. Oprah is an example of reaching peak transcendence with her magazines, a television network, and more, all of which have succeeded because of her name more than the medium. To be transcendent, it means giving up the security of an exclusivity contract and betting on your own brand for success. Marketing is all about reach and frequency, so spending all day building a community primarily on one platform is not optimal for achieving that larger presence.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every few years all of the iPad mini lovers hold their breath as they wait to see whether this very specific device will keep on trucking or hit the chopping block. Well they probably needn’t worry for a while as the device just got a big modern makeover with Apple’s new iPad Pro-like design, an A15 Bionic SoC and new display tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also probably shouldn’t worry so much because the iPad mini actually sells extremely well to a handful of markets. Professionals, including pilots, health care workers and industrial workers all use tablet devices for essential job functions &#8212; and Apple’s iPad is essentially the only device out there with enough penetration and compatibility to be viable. There basically isn’t a cockpit in the sky without an iPad. And where space is a premium like strapped to a pilot’s leg or in the large pocket of a lab coat, the iPad mini reigns supreme. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are, of course, just a broad array of people who find the iPad mini to be the perfect portable travel size and much easier to hold in the hand for long reading or watching sessions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new iPad mini brings all of those people right up to date in hardware and software. The redesign of the mini to incorporate the iPad Air and Pro design language is a welcome unification of the design theory of Apple’s “top end” iPads. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2206574" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0310-rotated.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The iPad &#8212; the entry point &#8212; also gets a behind the scenes upgrade while staying at the same price, which is nice. It does not get any of the new design cues or compatibility with the new pencil, but it’s still a very capable machine for the price. Given that Apple basically owns the tablet market, Apple could have phoned in the entry model bigtime but it’s still very good for the price and in use still feels fast and familiar. An IPS display and A13 Bionic may not be the edge of the envelope but if your need is just “an iPad” it’s nice to be able to buy the basic model and not be sold short at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the iPad mini gets both barrels &#8212; and a price point to match. At $499, Apple is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aiming for the entry point with this. The message is clearly “this is the best iPad we can make at this size,” and not at all, “smaller, cheaper.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For users who love the form factor but don’t love to be stuck a generation or two behind, that is an ideal scenario. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2206573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_0311-rotated.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest new behavior here is the top-mounted Touch ID, which debuted with the iPad Air. It’s fine &#8212; works fast and easily for the most part though it can lead to some awkward loops where you’re ‘resting to unlock’ but accidentally tap the power button to turn it back off. Overall I’d say it’s actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">easier</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use here than the Air, however, given that your hand fits around the edge of it that much easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some usability notes that aren’t that different from years past but still persist include that the split screen implementation is barely enough. It works but it feels a tad cramped at times, there could be a better solution here. Icon sizing is also a bit rough in vertical mode but feels perfect in horizontal. The sum is that there really needs a tweaked version of iPadOS specifically made for the iPad mini. At some points in its life I think that this definitely felt like more of a super long shot in the ‘will it happen’ department but now with the renewed and refreshed model on the table I’m willing to lobby for a 2022 bump that puts the iPad mini on its own plane of usability.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-6.01.27-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2206605" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-6.01.27-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything else about it is really enjoyable. The speed, lightness and increased screen size really make this feel like one of the most “iPad” iPads since the original. Looking back now the OG iPad was actually fairly heavy &#8212; but using it and touching it then, in context, really was shocking. A pure slab of computer. This version of the mini brings that feeling back for me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve done some reading, browsing and watching with it over the next couple of days and it’s been great. The addition of the new version of the Apple Pencil (made possible by the flat sides and magnetic charging) is a nice watershed, and makes this a great sketching tool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know you want an iPad mini you probably already know you want one &#8212; but if you’re on the fence, this is everything the iPad Air has to offer and more in a smaller package with all of the latest muscle. Very enticing on the whole.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber Eats is adding a new pickup map feature to its app that will allow users to search for restaurants or merchants close to them. The map localizes to the user, allowing them to type in what kind food they&#8217;re looking for using either words or emojis to see what&#8217;s nearby, including the exact distance from the user&#8217;s location.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206390" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206390" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2206390 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Uber-Eats-Searchable-Pickup-Map.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206390" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uber Eats</p></div></p>
<p>The new map feature is the latest example of Uber&#8217;s aim to build out Eats — a business unit the company believes will help it hit its profitability targets. Earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/uber-adjusts-third-quarter-forecast-in-light-of-increased-gross-bookings/">Uber said it could hit one measure of profitability</a> in the third quarter, earlier than expected. Uber said it anticipates an increase in gross bookings and stronger adjusted EBITDA in the quarter than it had forecasted for shareholders in its last investor presentation.</p>
<p>Eats says the new feature was inspired by feedback from as many as 8 out of 10 users who have switched to other map apps to search for nearby food. The map is rolling out globally and should be available now to most users, according to an Uber Eats spokesperson.</p>
<p>Within the Uber Eats app and the Uber app itself, users will see options to choose Delivery or Pickup at the top. The map is activated when a user selects Pickup specifically. Typing in a burger or pizza emoji should direct the user to nearby burger or pizza joints, which the company says creates increased functionality that is both a time-saver and a fun way to explore local commerce.</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">Uber Eats says there are 700,000 local restaurants and merchants on its pickup map. The company anticipates an international rise in pickup orders and said it wants to make it easy for customers to quickly visualize their search results.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The platform aims to give multi-channel brands a leg up when it comes to determining what the ideal stock level would be across all of their sales channels and inventory locations. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://flieber.com/">Flieber</a> wants to help e-commerce retailers get back to what they do best: selling.</p>
<p>The New York-based company announced Wednesday $12 million in Series A financing to continue developing its inventory optimization platform that uses analytics and machine learning to give multi-channel brands a leg up when it comes to determining what the ideal stock level would be across all of the sales channels and inventory locations.</p>
<p>The investment was co-led by GGV Capital and Monashees to bring the company’s total funding to $20 million since CEO Fabricio Miranda co-founded Flieber in 2019 with CTO Jair Vercosa.</p>
<p>Miranda, who previously founded and sold a water treatment company in Brazil before coming to the U.S. and working at a hedge fund, told TechCrunch the company’s predictive platform puts users in the driver’s seat for sales, supply chain operations and inventory decisions so that they can keep up with the pace of sales so that they avoid having too much, or not enough, inventory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was while he was at the hedge fund that he met someone opening an Amazon store and became interested in the process so much that he left the hedge fund and became an Amazon seller. His business became one of the top sellers, he said, and he learned the dynamics of the business and online retailing. In the course of opening several other businesses to support online sellers, like an advertising platform and financing business, Flieber was created to help retailers understand their inventory.</p>
<p>“When you open a retail business, you like selling, but in the end, you wind up spending 80% of your time with operations,” Miranda said. “Selling is so easy now with the marketplaces, but everything in order to sell is still from the 1950s, so we started studying it.”</p>
<p>He explained that inventory optimization is different from inventory management. Optimization makes sure a retailer has the right inventory at any given time to sell what needs to be sold. The approach is intelligence for decision-making, automation and supply chain layers, essentially telling the retailer what is the next best action with regards to inventory. Inventory management, on the other hand, is knowing what a retailer has to-date to be able to sell.</p>
<p>One of the main problems retailers often face is being out of stock. If a retailer is always out of stock of popular items and overstocked on lesser selling items, the retailer is consistently losing out on sales of the popular item while tying up revenue in inventory that isn’t selling, Miranda added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stockly lets e-commerce websites sell out-of-stock items from a shared inventory&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/stockly-lets-e-commerce-websites-sell-out-of-stock-items-from-a-shared-inventory/embed/#?secret=1JoH7dRfkv" data-secret="1JoH7dRfkv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Flieber’s technology gathers data to predict, for example, which products sell in a certain quantity and alerts the retailer to place an order for new inventory by a certain date in order to be able to sell it four months from that date. It also monitors sales so if those are accelerating or slowing down, retailers will know to either speed up or slow down the manufacturing process or reduce the sales.</p>
<p>“We are all the time projecting what you need and when to launch a new product,” Miranda said. “If a retailer’s product is similar to another product, the system is also able to predict how well that similar product will sell.”</p>
<p>Miranda said no other company was solving inventory optimization with this approach, so the opportunity “is a blue ocean.” He also sees the online retail world consolidating and moving back to the offline world, and the days of being “an Amazon seller” will be no more as retailers will sell where the consumers are, which will make inventory more complex.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Flieber now has clients selling in 15 countries and more than 400,000 products running on its platform. It has processed more than 20 million sales orders, and its system currently makes over 500,000 calculations daily.</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward accelerating that growth, improving the company’s data, hiring more data scientists and engineers and expanding its APIs.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Monashees will join GGV on the board of directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marketplaces and platforms have made selling products really easy,” said Carlo Dapuzzo, partner at Monashees, in a statement. “But everything that happens until you have the product in inventory ready to be sold is still extremely complex. Flieber&#8217;s mission to democratize that part of retail is a much needed step for the future of the retail industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Owners of Alexa devices will soon be able to use OnStar’s emergency services from their homes, under an expanded partnership between OnStar’s parent company General Motors and Amazon.</p>
<p>OnStar already expanded OnStar Guardian earlier this year with the introduction of the Guardian app, which lets customers access the service via their mobile device. This latest expansion will now bring customers’ voice-enabled home devices into that ecosystem.</p>
<p>While a customer could theoretically use the Guardian app inside their home today, GM’s head of Product Jeff Wajer told TechCrunch in a recent interview that there are many instances where people don’t have their phones on them but nevertheless may need to access emergency help. He noted that people with different accessibility levels, who may be unable to use a phone, could nevertheless shout for help using the OnStar-Alexa integration.</p>
<p>The integration will be rolled out gradually, first to an initial cohort of existing OnStar customers and then more broadly in 2022. Compatible Alexa devices include the Echo, Echo Dot or Echo Show. GM declined to provide further details on how many customers will have initial access to the service, or how much it might cost, but Wajer did say there would be an initial free trial for OnStar customers in the first cohort.</p>
<p>OnStar Guardian is available to customers regardless of whether they drive a GM vehicle. However, this is not GM’s first collaboration with Amazon. The company has already introduced Amazon Alexa to the infotainment systems of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/gm-is-bringing-amazon-alexa-to-2018-and-newer-cadillac-chevy-buick-and-gmc-vehicles/">select vehicles</a>, and this newest partnership marks a strengthening of the ties between the two companies.</p>
<p>It’s also an indication that the automaker is seeking to strengthen its software and subscription businesses beyond the vehicle itself. The new offering “demonstrates GM’s commitment to its growth strategy and innovating its software enabled services,” the automaker’s VP of global innovation, Pam Fletcher, said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sundayapp.com">Sunday</a>, a startup that didn’t exist just a few months ago, has raised a $100 million Series A funding round. Today’s funding round is led by Coatue with participation from partners of DST Global. Investors in the restaurant, hospitality and tech industries are also participating.</p>
<p>I already wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/sunday-raises-24-million-seed-round-to-build-a-fast-restaurant-checkout-flow/">lengthy profile</a> of Sunday when it announced its $24 million seed round back in April. I encourage you to read it in case you want to learn more about the company.</p>
<p>Sunday has been founded by Victor Lugger, Tigrane Seydoux and Christine de Wendel. The first two co-founders in this list are also the founders of <a href="https://www.bigmammagroup.com">Big Mamma</a>. Christine de Wendel was previously the head of France at <a href="https://www.zalando.fr">Zalando</a> and the COO of <a href="https://www.manomano.fr">ManoMano</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, the startup has developed a checkout system for physical restaurants. You can put QR codes on tables, customers can scan this QR code and browse the menu. When everyone is done, you can scan the QR code again to check the bill, leave a tip, split the bill and walk away. Customers can pay using Apple Pay, Google Pay, American Express, Visa and Mastercard.</p>

<p>The product connects directly with your existing cash register system. The company supports Oracle Micros, Brinks, Tiller, Zelty, Revo, CashPad, etc. Restaurants don’t pay any monthly subscription fee or setup fee. Sunday charges pay processing fees based on usage.</p>
<p>And it’s an easy sell as most customers choose to pay using the QR code. Restaurants can save in wait time and get a better table turnover rate as people tend to leave the restaurant more quickly. Of course, some people want human interactions when they go to a restaurant and Sunday thinks those interactions can create friction. Not everybody will be a fan of the product.</p>
<p>While Sunday launched its product just five months ago, 1.1 million people have used Sunday to pay for a restaurant bill already. Over 1,500 restaurants are using it around the world. The startup is executing at a rapid pace as it has hired 170 employees across five countries —&nbsp;the U.S., the U.K., Spain, France and Canada.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the startup plans to expand to new restaurants, launch new features, such as table booking, ordering and loyalty programs. And the company wants to increase its growth rate. By the end of 2022, Sunday hopes to work with 15,000 restaurants. The team will also double in size over the next twelve months.</p>
<p>“This new investment round is a remarkable opportunity for Sunday to build a powerful tech stack and develop new product features such as ordering &amp; loyalty programs. It also allows us to accelerate in the U.S. market by growing our sales, operations and partnerships teams. We are now in a very good position to hire top talent to drive the speed and stellar execution needed to succeed,” co-founder and CEO US Christine de Wendel said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Osano, a risk and compliance startup, has confirmed it has raised $11 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by Jump Capital and with participation from existing investors LiveOak Venture Partners and Next Coast Ventures.</p>
<p>The Austin, Texas-based company describes the round as a Series A-1, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/osano-series-a/">a $5 million Series A raise</a> in 2019, just months after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/osano-risk-compliance-battlefield/">debuted</a> at TechCrunch Startup Battlefield. In total, the startup has raised $22.3 million to date.</p>
<p>Osano is a software-as-a-service platform that helps companies to monitor and manage their risk and compliance with privacy laws, like Europe&#8217;s GDPR and California&#8217;s CCPA, which grant users access to and more control over their personal information.</p>
<p>The company also tracks changes to the rules and laws it covers to make sure that customers don&#8217;t accidentally fall out of compliance, which can lead to hefty fines for egregious breaches.</p>
<p>Osano is also rolling out a new AI-powered data discovery tool to automatically find and classify dozens of types of personal and non-personal data. Osano also offers integrations with dozens of apps and services, including AWS, Dropbox, Google, and Oracle.</p>
<p>The $11 million cash injection will go towards doubling the company&#8217;s headcount, with a focus on sales to meet its growing demand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Mexico City-based last-mile logistics platform Cargamos wants to own same-day delivery in Latin America. The company has announced a $7 million raise in follow-on funding, bringing its total seed round to $11 million, which it will use to create a nationwide distributed warehouse network so regional retailers can compete with giants like Amazon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cargamos intends to use the funding to build a large fulfilment facility in Mexico City. It also wants to expand its network of mini distribution centers which it calls points of delivery AKA &#8220;pods,&#8221; where packages are sorted and sent out for final delivery.<i> </i>The company currently has about 50 pods, but wants to more than double that number in the next six months so that it can cover a service area around Mexico City of up to 75 additional cities, according to Ivan Ariza, founder and CEO of Cargamos.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ariza told TechCrunch that while Cargamos was founded in 2019, this is his second attempt at starting a last-mile logistics business. When he first tried around 2013, e-commerce wasn&#8217;t yet popular enough in the region to succeed. Now, Latin America is expecting powerful growth in the e-commerce market, with a forecasted 29 percent growth in volume between 2020 and 2024 and a projected market size of $580 billion, with Mexico and Brazil leading the way, according to Americas Market Intelligence (AMI) analysis from its <strong><a href="https://americasmi.com/services/latin-america-ecommerce-datapack-2020-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020-2024 LatAm E-Commerce Datapack</a></strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The problem in Mexico is the orchestration of optimization,&#8221; Ariza told TechCrunch. &#8220;The networks are not connected, they&#8217;re basically a mess and have really poor technology. Right now we believe that e-commerce exists, but the only blocker for Latin America is the lack of logistics here that makes it very expensive and difficult for people of low incom. That&#8217;s why Cargamos exists. We want to increase the speed and decrease the cost in the region, and open the door for e-commerce across LATAM.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, Cargamos works with three of Mexico&#8217;s largest retailers, including Liverpool, Mexico&#8217;s largest chain of department stores, as well the top 50 companies with an e-commerce channel in the country, according to the company. When it builds its fulfilment facility, it will be able to expand its service to smaller and medium-sized businesses that don&#8217;t have their own fulfilment centers, opening the door for expanded e-commerce in Mexico.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Retailers can access Cargamos&#8217; pod network via its cloud-based software platform which includes smart routing and an ability to get a birds&#8217; eye view of the different points of logistics, from fulfilment to pod to front door.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cargamos&#8217; pods are created out of unused spaces in parking garages and shopping malls and are strategically located in urban areas to shorten the distance to the end-customer, allowing for what Ariza calls &#8220;quick commerce&#8221; or delivery in around two hours. Cargamos has its own fleet of delivery vehicles and drivers, but its platform allows for third party carriers to connect to the network, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The company says 25 percent of its delivery fleet is made up of zero emissions vehicles like electric cars, bicycles and electric motorcycles. Eco-friendly transport and multiple pod locations allow Cargamos to reduce the carbon footprint of each package by 80 percent, according to the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As Cargamos seeks national expansion with this funding round, it also announced plans to enter the U.S. and Colombian markets in the mid to long-term. Investors in the seed round include Kavak CEO and founder Carlos Garcia Otati, Jüsto CEO and founder Ricardo Weder, and Mercê do Bairro founder and COO Guilherme Bonifacio, as well as VCs like Nazca, FEMSA and Kayyak Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com">Dapper Labs</a>, the company behind popular fantasy basketball NFT game <a href="https://nbatopshot.com">NBA Top Shot</a>, has raised another $250 million in funding. Coatue is leading the new investment. According to a source close to the company, today’s funding round values the company at $7.6 billion.</p>
<p>Existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, GV and Version One Ventures are investing once again. Some new investors are also joining the round, such as BOND and Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC).</p>
<p>Dapper Labs is better known as the maker of NBA Top Shots. Users can buy digital cards that represent NBA players and moments. They can then buy and sell some of their cards to other players. The value of these digital collectibles can go up and down over time.</p>
<p>The platform is based on NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Each digital card is registered as a unique token on a blockchain. Dapper Labs has developed <a href="https://www.onflow.org">Flow</a>, a new blockchain built for scalability and practical use cases, such as NBA Top Shot.</p>
<p>“We think Dapper Labs is a leader in the space at the infrastructure level with the Flow blockchain and at the application layer with NBA Top Shot. We continue to be impressed by Roham’s strong leadership and vision and we could not be more proud to partner with him and the entire team at Dapper,” Coatue Ventures Chairman Dan Rose said in a statement.</p>
<p>And this is an interesting statement as Sorare <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/sorare-raises-680-million-for-its-fantasy-sports-nft-game/">raised $680 million</a> at a $4.3 billion valuation just a few days ago. Sorare currently focuses on fantasy football (soccer) and uses the Ethereum blockchain for its NFT platform. They use ZK rollups to lower transaction fees.</p>

<p>Dapper Labs and Sorare will soon compete for the same player base. Sorare has decided to expand to other professional sports while Dapper Labs just signed a partnership with LaLiga, the Spanish football association — LaLiga has also partnered with Sorare.</p>
<p>These two companies are taking a different approach and opting for a different tech stack. So it&#8217;s going to be interesting to see whether there&#8217;s enough room for two players. Dapper Labs expect to launch its LaLiga experience in June 2022.</p>
<p>NBA Top Shot currently has 1.1 million registered users. These users have traded more than $780 million. Dapper Labs is also betting heavily on its infrastructure play with its new blockchain Flow. It could power other experiences beyond fantasy sports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shipping companies, power plants, and investment banks don&#8217;t often share much in common, but new research shows they are all inadvertently leaking thousands of email passwords of their own employees, thanks in part to a design flaw in a widely used email protocol.</p>
<p>Autodiscover is a feature in Microsoft Exchange, a popular email software for companies to host their own email servers, to set up apps on a phone or a computer using just an employee&#8217;s email address and password. It&#8217;s meant to make it easier to set up an email or calendar app, for example, by offloading the hard work to the server than configuring the app by hand.</p>
<p>Most apps will look for the configuration file in places on the company&#8217;s domain where it knows to look. Each time it looks somewhere and can&#8217;t find it, the app will &#8220;fail up&#8221; and somewhere else on the same domain. And if it can&#8217;t find the file, then users are left with the inconvenience.</p>
<p>But some apps will inadvertently fail up one step further before hitting a wall. That&#8217;s a problem because behind the scenes the app is trying to communicate with a domain name that&#8217;s outside of the company&#8217;s control but within the same top-level domain — so, for example <code>company.com</code> would end up looking for the configuration file on <code>autodiscover.com</code>. Anyone who owns that domain name could &#8220;listen&#8221; to the email addresses and passwords as they are sent across the internet</p>
<p>Researchers have for years warned that <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/asia-17/briefings/schedule/#all-your-emails-belong-to-us-exploiting-vulnerable-email-clients-via-domain-name-collision-5301">email apps are vulnerable</a> to this kind of data leakage and can put a company&#8217;s credentials at risk. Several apps were fixed at the time, but it&#8217;s clearly a problem that hasn&#8217;t gone away.</p>
<p>In April, Guardicore Labs <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/labs/autodiscovering-the-great-leak/">acquired the autodiscover domains</a> for some of the most common top-level domains — <code>autodiscover.uk</code>, <code>autodiscover.fr</code>, and so on — and set them to &#8220;listen&#8221; to leaky requests as they arrive.</p>
<p>In four months, Guardicore says it identified 340,000 exposed Exchange mailbox credentials hitting those domains. Some companies allow those same credentials to be used to log onto that domain, posing a risk if misused by a malicious hacker. Guardicore said the credentials were sent over the internet in plaintext and could be read at the other end.</p>
<p>Another 96,000 Exchange credentials were sent using protocols that are far stronger and cannot be decrypted, but could be tricked into sending the same credentials over the wire in the clear.</p>
<p>Amit Serper, Guardicore&#8217;s security research lead for North America and the author of the research, developed an attack that bounced back the encrypted credentials with a request to the app to use a weaker level of security to send the email address and password again, prompting the app to re-send the credentials in cleartext.</p>
<p>Serper named the attack, perhaps fittingly, &#8220;The ol&#8217; switcheroo.&#8221;</p>
<p>The domains also saw exposed credentials from real estate companies, food manufacturers, and publicly traded companies in China, Serper said.</p>
<p>For the average user, the leak is practically invisible. Guardicore is not immediately naming the apps that are the biggest culprits of leaked credentials, since many of the app makers are still working on rolling out fixes. Serper told TechCrunch that once the apps are fixed, the domains will be sinkholed but will remain under Guardicore&#8217;s control to prevent them from falling into the hands of malicious actors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not an exhaustive list of domains under Guardicore&#8217;s control, but companies and users can take their own precautions by blocking autodiscover domains at the top-level, Serper said. App makers can also not let their apps fail upwards outside of a company&#8217;s domain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our world is drowning in human-generated microplastics. And while these tiny fragments of non-biodegradable plastic &#8212; floating in the sea, embedded in the soil &#8212; are hard to see with the naked eye they pose a gigantic threat to life.</p>
<p>Inexorably, plastic pollution is finding its way into the human food chain, with unknown implications for our health as we consume fragments of plastic that wash into our water supplies or have been unwittingly consumed by the fish and other sea creatures that we eat.</p>
<p>Research has shown that microplastics are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/02/microplastics-killing-fish-before-they-reach-reproductive-age-study-finds">harmful and even fatal to aquatic creatures</a>, causing fish to die before they can reproduce or stunting their growth as they fill up on fragments of plastic instead of food.</p>
<p>The health impact for humans of increasing consumption of plastic is clearly not good. (Microplastics have, for example, been shown to be a vector for other harmful stuff &#8212; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969721026917">trapping heavy metals</a> and other pollutants.)</p>
<p>This seemingly invisible pollution in soils is equally problematic for sustaining life &#8212; because microplastics degrade soil fertility and diversity, impoverishing the soil&#8217;s microbiome and reducing the amount of food that can be produced from farmed land. (And with a growing human population to feed that&#8217;s another crippling sustainability challenge flowing from our habit of littering the environment with plastic dust.)</p>
<p>Paris-based greentech startup <a href="https://calyxia.com">Calyxia</a> thinks it has an answer to humanity&#8217;s microplastics problem &#8212; and is targeting this planet-wide pollution crisis with novel chemistry.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s developed what it bills as &#8220;environmentally friendly&#8221; and &#8220;advanced performance&#8221; biodegradable microcapsule technology which it says can reduce the amount of harmful microplastics that human activity is putting into the environment &#8212; assuming, of course, widespread take-up by manufacturers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 2015-founded startup is now announcing a €15 million Series A (~$17.6M) funding round led by the impact investor, Astanor Ventures, as it gears up to get its first products to market this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting in a statement, Hendrik Van Asbroeck, partner at Astanor Ventures, said: “Beyond the already enormous feat of decreasing microplastic pollution into our ecosystems, Calyxia’s technology will dramatically reduce the impact of the global agrifood, home care and advanced materials industries. With a deeply mission-driven team, extensive technological expertise, growing product pipeline, and eco-friendly manufacturing process, Calyxia is poised to make an exponential impact on a global scale.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The round brings Calyxia&#8217;s total raised to €23M, with earlier backing from business angels, and through the award of a number of grants including European Commission SME Instrument (2018), BPI Innov’Up Leader (2019) and BPI Plan de Relance awards (2020).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Astanor Ventures launches $325M Impact Fund aimed at food tech and ag tech startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/astanor-ventures-launches-325m-impact-fund-aimed-at-foodtech-and-agtech-startups/embed/#?secret=ts1CLfeMZf" data-secret="ts1CLfeMZf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Some of Calyxia&#8217;s initial partners are producing fast-moving consumer goods (specifically laundry liquids) and &#8216;crop protection&#8217; for agriculture.</p>
<p>The startup says it&#8217;s partnering with &#8220;leading&#8221; (top three) manufacturers in Europe and globally in these target sectors. (It can&#8217;t disclose the partners yet for commercial reasons but, certainly with the laundry liquids, its customers will be household names.)</p>
<p>On &#8216;crop protection&#8217;, this catch-all label can refer to chemicals like insecticides, herbicides and pesticides but also to enzymes, pheromones and &#8216;bio-inputs&#8217;, depending on the specific product. And Calyxia co-founder and CEO, Jamie Walters, tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s committed to only working with partners whose products don&#8217;t have other &#8220;ecotoxic&#8221; problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a company our values &#8212; in fact, our mission &#8212; is to build a safer, superior and sustainable future for all,&#8221; says Walters. &#8220;So we do not work with any pesticide that is unsafe, that&#8217;s not sustainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>That mission would rule out Calyxia partnering with producers of certain notorious weedkillers which have &#8212; for example &#8212; been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47633086">linked to cancers in humans</a> and <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/glyphosate-weedkiller-could-be-killing-off-bees-scientists-warn-11508062">mass deaths of bees</a>, among other reported harms. (When asked a direct question, Walters confirms there is &#8220;no, not a chance&#8221; of it working with the maker of glyphosate.)</p>
<p>Instead of using plastic (non-biodegradable) microcapsules &#8212; to add &#8216;value&#8217; to products at the expense of the environment &#8212; the promise is that Calyxia&#8217;s chosen partners will be using its biodegradable microcapsule technology to shrink how much plastic pollution their products generate, while still being able to tout long-lasting &#8216;fresh&#8217; scents (in the case of laundry liquid makers) or sustained crop protection that won&#8217;t just wash away after a rain shower.</p>
<p>While you might think those particular use-cases for microcapsules might be better eliminated altogether, Walters argues that the use of the technology for crop protection is helpful to reducing the amount of pesticide which needs to be used &#8212; meaning there may be wider environmental benefits to continued use.</p>
<p>Not so much for fragranced laundry liquids, though. Added &#8216;perfumes&#8217; have no hidden benefits beyond being smelly &#8212; at best you could argue their use might help encouraging people to wash their clothes less frequently. But it&#8217;s a pretty big stretch to justify the use of extra chemicals that are also linked to allergies and other human health problems.</p>
<p>The reason for continued use there is largely economic. Laundry liquid makers want to shift more product &#8212; and think they will if washed clothes &#8216;smell nice&#8217;.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, continued use of smelly laundry liquids and sustained crop protection are just two of the use-cases that result in microplastics being release into the environment. The problem is far bigger than either of those use-cases which we could at least envisage stopping altogether and replacing with less harmful interventions.</p>
<p>After all, some industrial processes that have involved intentionally incorporating tiny plastic fragments into products have been banned already &#8212; such as the use of plastic micro beads as an exfoliant in cosmetics. And the <a href="https://echa.europa.eu/-/scientific-committees-eu-wide-restriction-best-way-to-reduce-microplastic-pollution">European Union is mulling a ban</a> on all intentionally added microplastics. However industry lobbying has complicated the picture &#8212; and appears to be delaying legislative action.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The wider problem is that most microplastics do not start out as crafted as micro fragments but rather get generated through wear of a larger amount of a material. Basically, f</span>riction causes tiny fragments to break off and escape &#8212; washing into waterways and oceans, ending up in soils and sediment, or collecting in the dust in our urban environments.</p>
<p>(Car tyres, for example, are a major source of pollutive micro-particles. And there again there are serious human health implications &#8212; think of the dust citydwellers must constant breath in. So even though an electric vehicle could have zero exhaust emissions it may still be littering our urban livingspaces with fragments of rubber that degrade our health.)</p>
<p>This is why Calyxia&#8217;s business looks a lot more interesting &#8212; and scalable &#8212; than it might seem at first glance if you focus on the eco-scented laundry liquid angle: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Because the startup has devised a version of its microcapsule technology that can be added to other materials &#8212; plastics, coatings, foams etc &#8212; to make them more wear-resistant and therefore limit how much microplastics their use creates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Reducing the generation of microplastics over time by allowing the materials to perform better under friction could have wider benefits too &#8212; longer lasting, harder wearing components, say, as well as better environmental credentials. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Primary microplastics that people add to have a benefit represent less than 17% of microplastics. The other 83% comes from the deterioration of plastics and rubbers in our lives,&#8221; explains Walters. &#8220;The same with coatings, road-markings, the same with paint. So what we do is we have an ingredient that you add to plastics, or paint, or packaging, or coatings, and then when there&#8217;s any abrasion it causes the capsules to open, deliver a lubricant at the surface preventing wear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our one ingredient added in a small percentage can increase the lifespan of materials by 10x. Can increase the wear resistance by 10x. And can reduce microplastic generation by over 10x.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this more broadly applicable technology, Walters says the startup will be producing a new portfolio of plastic products &#8212; &#8220;coatings, composites, foams, plastics in automotive applications, in sporting goods, in consumer goods; wherever there&#8217;s a material that undergoes wear&#8221;.</p>
<p>The potential for such a substance &#8212; assuming it performs as billed &#8212; to limit unintentionally released microplastics looks huge.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s good news because the challenge of plastic pollution is certainly a planet-wrapping one.</p>
<p>Walters says this broader microcapsule technology &#8212; which it&#8217;s calling Caly-Shield &#8212; will be released this year. (For laundry fragrance its product will be marketed as &#8216;enviro-caps&#8217;. While for agricultural use-cases its active ingredient delivery capsules will be called &#8216;natura-caps&#8217;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;By making [materials] more wear resistant you have a 10x longer lifespan so you can replace them fewer times &#8212; which also [means] a massive environmental footprint reduction. And you can replace them before the microplastics are generated,&#8221; he adds on the Caly-Shield tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;People talk about this topic less because people are more familiar with agriculture and fragrances but this is really one of the biggest causes of microplastics in the world today. And our technology here will transform the material world in this area.&#8221;</p>
<p>While biodegradable microplastics certainly sound a lot better than the current fragments &#8212; which have a habit of hanging around for centuries &#8212; it&#8217;s fair to say that biodegradable plastics don&#8217;t always have the greatest reputation.</p>
<p>Biodegradable plastic bags, for example, have been <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135421003213">shown to break down into lots of little pieces of plastic</a> &#8212; creating, yep, more microplastics! &#8212; which may then take a very long time to rot away, thereby meaning plastic pollution lingers in the environment as an ecotoxin, posing all the aforementioned risks to animal and human life&#8230;</p>
<p>Asked how Calyxia is able to guarantee that its &#8220;biodegradable&#8221; microcapsules do, in fact, disintegrate rapidly and don&#8217;t hang around long enough to interfere with the environment, Walters says the company is using a new process to manufacture microcapsules which allows for the use of many different materials as an alternative to using microplastic.</p>
<p>He also notes it has puts its tech through independent testing which he says has demonstrated that its biodegradable capsules do really do the job of disappearing quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All microcapsules produced in the world today are produced by one process. They produce polyurethane or polymelamine formaldehyde capsules&#8230; We have invented a new process that&#8217;s environmentally sustainable &#8212; so energy efficient, water efficient, we&#8217;ll be zero carbon or carbon neutral next year. So our process is more sustainable but more than that our process is compatible with thousands of different shell materials,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you the specific material we use for the capsules themselves because our competitors are very big chemical companies and they&#8217;re very aggressive, but what I can tell you is that we have [an independent testing company] regularly analyzing our capsules [to determine if performance meets the standard of the OECD 301 biodegradability test].&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately the capsules have been demonstrated to be fully biodegradable,&#8221; he adds, saying that for the home-care microcapsules the test involves verifying that microbes in waste water treatment facilities fully consume the capsules so that no plastics end up in the ocean. For agriculture a soil test is performed &#8212; with the capsules placed in soil and an assessment of the biodegradation rate carried out as soil microbes consume the capsules.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve confirmed in soil tests by an independent testing laboratory and in waste water plant by an independent testing laboratory that they&#8217;re biodegradable and that they&#8217;re fully consumed into CO2 and oxygen,&#8221; Walters adds.</p>
<p>Some of the NGOs campaigning for EU regulations to ban microplastics have raised concerns that industry lobbying will create loopholes for manufacturers to continue using damaging plastics &#8212; either in even smaller forms (so called nanoplastics) or by widening the definition of biodegradable, as well as these vested interests continuing to push to delay regulations banning use.</p>
<p>We also asked Walters about this and he confirmed Calyxia&#8217;s capsules are not nano plastics (nor are they classed as microplastics), reiterating: &#8220;They are biodegradable, and leave no trace in the environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with the NGO opposition to the long transitional periods. Lobbyists are trying to extend the transition period. For me, the regulation should be enforced now, as there are available biodegradable solutions,&#8221; he also told us. &#8220;I also agree with NGO opposition on the very broad definition of biodegradability. Lobbyists are trying the broaden the original proposition of the European Commission. This is a problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;The original proposition was a test called the OECD 301 B. This is a very strict test for biodegradability that many company’s products do not pass today. Calyxia capsules do pass this strict test.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The European Commission should reduce the transition period, and not extend the definition of biodegradability,&#8221; he urged.</p>
<p>While Calyxia&#8217;s technology sounds like it could be great news for stemming the flow of new microplastics into our environment, it obviously cannot do anything to clean up existing microplastic pollution.</p>
<p>On that Walters says other innovations will be needed &#8212; to the extent that removing so many tiny fragments is humanly possible. It may be that we are saddled with this toxic legacy for hundreds &#8212; or even a thousand years.</p>
<p>At the same time, scientists have been working on developing enzymes that can consume plastic &#8212; and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/28/new-super-enzyme-eats-plastic-bottles-six-times-faster">last year</a> a so-called &#8216;super enzyme&#8217; was reported to have been engineered that was able to consume plastic 6x faster than previous bioengineering efforts. So it&#8217;s certainly interesting to speculate whether a environmentally friendly microcapsule technology which enables delayed release of active substances might be an interesting delivery system for plastic eating enzymes &#8212; to essentially bake in a rapid self-destruct mechanism to products made of plastic so they can&#8217;t end up as pollution.</p>
<p>Certainly we need to get a whole lot smarter about the materials we make &#8212; considering the entire lifecycle of products and what happens at their end-of-life, rather than just pumping out more shiny new stuff without a care for tomorrow.</p>
<p>However the inevitably higher up-front-cost for product manufacturers of eco interventions like Calyxia&#8217;s means regulators have a key role to play in setting conditions where environmental considerations must be baked into product development by default. Really moving the needle on microplastics means it can&#8217;t just be left up to a few &#8216;leading&#8217; brands to shell out for the chance to market their &#8216;green&#8217; solution as a product differentiator.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not seeing people dying from microplastic pollution today and we&#8217;re not seeing animals becoming extinct and the food chain becoming extinct. But&#8230; if we leave this problem unsolved, then within a decade or two, particularly with the rising population and the growing consumerism, it could reach a level where we can&#8217;t correct it,&#8221; says Walters. &#8220;We can&#8217;t remove microplastics from the ocean. We can remove bulk plastics but we can&#8217;t remove microplastics. So if it reaches a catastrophically high level of pollutants it&#8217;s too late&#8230; We need to act now before it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Calyxia&#8217;s solution you could eliminate microplastics in agriculture and laundry products and you could start to introduce it into materials across the world. But it will take time to implement everywhere,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;What we really need is we need regulators in the US and Asia to follow the European lead. And to start putting limits on microplastic generated from materials &#8212; and start banning microplastics on products in the US and Asia too.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can do that global manufacturers across the world will have no other solution but to change their practices &#8212; and either with Calyxia&#8217;s technology or another technology they&#8217;ll find solutions.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor has tapped Redwood Materials to create a closed loop system for its upcoming deluge of electric vehicles — a partnership that will cover recycling production scrap and EVs at the end of their life as well as supplying the automaker with raw battery materials.</p>
<p>The deal comes as Ford adds more electric vehicles to its portfolio, including the Mustang Mach E that launched last year and the upcoming<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/"> F-150 Lightning pickup truck</a>. Securing a supply of batteries — or the materials to make them — has prompted the automotive industry to partner with cell manufacturers and increasingly turn to companies like Redwood Materials.</p>
<p>Ford alone will require a hefty supply. The company&#8217;s global plans for battery electric vehicle calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell capacity by 2030, according to the automaker. That is roughly 10 plants&#8217; worth of capacity. Ford has previously said that 140 GWh will be required in North America, with the balance dedicated to other regions, including Europe and China.</p>
<p>&#8220;Closing the loop for us in our end-of-life products and allowing those to re enter the supply chain will help us drive down costs,&#8221; Lisa Drake, Ford&#8217;s chief operating officer in North America, said during a press briefing. &#8220;Of course, it&#8217;ll help us reduce the reliance on importing a lot of the materials that we use today when we build the batteries. And then it&#8217;ll reduce the mining of raw materials, which is going to be incredibly important in the future as we start to scale on this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of this, Drake says, will made EVs cheaper and more sustainable.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials recycles scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. The company, which was founded and is led by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, says it can recover, on average, more than 95% of the elements like nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper.</p>
<p>Redwood then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to its customers, which today includes Panasonic at the Gigafactory in Nevada that it operates with Tesla and Envision AESC’s battery plant in Tennessee. Redwood has also partnered with Amazon to recycle EV and other lithium-ion batteries and e-waste from parts of their businesses. Redwood&#8217;s first automotive partnership was secured earlier this year with electric commercial vehicle manufacturer Proterra.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The risk is that we find ourselves in a situation perhaps a little bit similar to current global semiconductor shortage <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">if we don&#8217;t plan ahead, and if we aren&#8217;t strategic about the production capacity and the right regions at the right time</span>&#8221; Straubel said during the briefing. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>
<p>Under the partnership announced Wednesday, Redwood Materials will initially work with Ford to set up recycling within the automaker&#8217;s battery production network and then funnel the recovered raw materials back to the manufacturer to be used in batteries. While Ford didn&#8217;t provide specific details, that likely means working with its battery cell supplier SK.</p>
<p>In May, Ford and SK signed an initial agreement to create a joint venture &#8212; to be called BlueOvalSK &#8212; to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours annually in traction battery cells and array modules, starting mid-decade.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of the Redwood Materials-Ford partnership is to touch the entire battery lifecycle from recycling production scrap and supplying Ford with materials to creating recycling options for the end-of-life vehicles. That last piece is complex because Ford will no longer own its EVs, many of which will have multiple owners before they&#8217;re ready for the scrap heap.</p>
<p>The deal follows a string of announcements in recent months by Redwood Materials. The company recently raised more than $775 million — a round that TechCrunch learned includes $50 million from Ford. (The company initially announced the round was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/">more than $700 million</a>.)</p>
<p>It also revealed in September plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/jb-straubels-redwood-materials-is-expanding-into-the-battery-materials-business/">expand its business</a> beyond battery recycling and into the production of critical battery materials at a new million-square-foot factory in the United States. Redwood wants to produce cathodes and anode foils, the building blocks of a lithium-ion battery structure.</p>
<p>The factory, which the company is currently scouting a location for, would likely be dedicated to the production of cathodes. Redwood has said it intends for the factory to ramp up to 100 gigawatt hours of capacity to produce cathode material, enough for one million electric vehicles by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business tools have gone completely virtual in the last 20 months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and today a startup whose e-document platform has played a big role in supporting that shift is announcing a big round of funding on the heels of huge growth. <a href="https://www.pandadoc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PandaDoc</a>, which lets users create, share and sign official documents online, has closed a Series C that the company confirms values it at $1 billion.</p>
<p>To be clear, PandaDoc is not making the full amount of funding in this round public. The company is based out of San Francisco, but it has extensive operations in Belarus, where it has been in hot political water &#8212; several employees were arrested by authorities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/pandadoc-employees-arrested-in-belarus-after-founders-protest-against-lukashenko-regime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a year ago</a> there after publicly protesting the current regime. The lack of disclosure on the size of this round is intentional and related to this. From what we understand, that situation is still ongoing.</p>
<p>OMERS Growth Equity and G Squared are co-leading this Series C, and Altos Ventures, Rembrandt Venture Partners, One Peak Partners, and Microsoft&#8217;s venture arm M12 are also participating.</p>
<p>Prior to this, PandaDoc had raised around $36 million and its valuation was around $255 million, according to data from <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/56893-60/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>. The big hike in valuation with this round can also be seen as a marker of the size of the Series C.</p>
<p>Today PandaDoc &#8212; which competes with the likes of DocuSign, Eversign, DocSend, GetAccept and others &#8212; already provides a range of services to users across many different verticals. Content ranges from building and collecting e-signatures and payments around contracts, proposals and forms through to invoices; and PandaDoc&#8217;s users are also pretty varied, including construction, education, medical, and professional services businesses &#8212; some 30,000 customers in all. The plan will be to double down on growing more of that current business as well as bring more functionality and use cases into the fold.</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan on getting broader and deeper in the areas where we already play,&#8221; Mikita Mikado, PandaDoc&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch. Its contract management product is one of the most popular already in the market, and PandaDoc claims that its e-signature solution is one of the top three in terms of ubiquity. &#8220;We are going to continue competing in these areas, but at the same time we plan to go global this year and invest in localization and international growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>That comes on the heels of an already-strong business. PandaDoc&#8217;s customers are currently distributed across some 130 countries, and in the last year its user base has grown by 80%, with revenues jumping 63%. (The company&#8217;s business model is based around a freemium model, where basic e-signing is free &#8212; notably, a tweak it made at the start of the pandemic, and perhaps one reason it&#8217;s one of the top-three e-signing solutions today &#8212; and additional features and usage are priced in $19/month, $49/month, and enterprise-scale &#8220;let&#8217;s talk&#8221; tiers.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The &#8220;let&#8217;s talk&#8221; tier is important in the context of this investment. Small and medium businesses are the company&#8217;s bread and butter but investors see an opportunity in selling up market, too, by way of vastly expanding the features that it provides to customers.</p>
<p>“As a leader in the SMB segment, we believe the company is uniquely positioned to challenge current incumbents with a dynamic full-stack product that goes far beyond e-signing,&#8221; said Larry Aschebrook, managing partner at G Squared, said in a statement. &#8220;The management team is one of the best we’ve seen, and we look forward to supporting their creative and efficient approach to this fast-growing space.”</p>
<p>Mikado puts it a different way: &#8220;The more workflows that we can automate and achieve and do over time, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">PandaDoc&#8217;s widening window of opportunity is a sign of the times. </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">Covid-19 has precipitated a huge amount of so-called &#8220;digital transformation&#8221;: organizations that in the past used to carry out a lot more work in physical environments, were essentially, overnight, asked to shift all of that into digital, virtualized formats. </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">While that has definitely seen companies make bigger infrastructure and operational shifts, it&#8217;s also played out on a more immediate services level. Specifically, daily materials like documents that people have long relied on in physical formats still were getting created, shared and made official, but now all of that needed to be done in a digital format: that ushered in a big wave of business to companies like PandaDoc.</span></p>
<p>The company got its start, Mikado said, with B2B sales, &#8220;but we have started getting requests from organizations that have other use cases that aren’t in the same bucket, such as schools, government institutions and healthcare organizations trying to streamline their employee onboarding, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s partly because of this trend that investors have been swarming around enterprise tech. The other main reason in this case is that PandaDoc has proven to be one of the solutions that&#8217;s seen a lot of traction.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We are proud to have led this new investment in PandaDoc – a highly-innovative company that is shaping the future of documents, through its robust, all-in-one document automation platform,&#8221; said Mark Shulgan, managing partner and head of OMERS Growth Equity. &#8220;PandaDoc is a leader in the document automation market, and its solutions allow businesses to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and accelerate their growth. We are thrilled to support Mikita Mikado’s ambitious vision, and look forward to supporting him and his team in this further evolution.&#8221;</p>
