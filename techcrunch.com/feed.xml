</div><p id="speakable-summary">Growing up, did you ever wonder how many chairs you’d have to stack to reach the sky?</p>
<p>No? I guess that’s just me then.</p>
<p>As a child, I always asked a lot of “how many/much” questions. Some were legitimate (&#8220;How much is 1 USD in VND?&#8221;); some were absurd (&#8220;How tall is the sky and can it be measured in chairs?&#8221;). So far, I’ve managed to maintain my obnoxious statistical probing habit without making any mortal enemies in my 20s. As it turns out, that habit comes with its perks when working in product.</p>

		<blockquote>
			Growing up, did you ever wonder how many chairs you’d have to stack to reach the sky?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>My first job as a product designer was at a small but energetic fintech startup whose engineers also dabbled in pulling data. I constantly bothered them with questions like, “How many exports did we have from that last feature launched?” and “How many admins created at least one rule on this page?” I was curious about quantitative analysis but did not know where to start.</p>
<p>I knew I wasn’t the only one. Even then, there was a growing need for basic data literacy in the tech industry, and it’s only getting more taxing by the year. Words like “data-driven,” “data-informed” and “data-powered” increasingly litter every tech organization’s product briefs. But where does this data come from? Who has access to it? How might I start digging into it myself? How might I leverage this data in my day-to-day design once I get my hands on it?</p>
<h2>Data discovery for all: What’s in the way?</h2>
<p>“Curiosity is our compass” is one of Kickstarter’s guiding principles. Powered by a desire for knowledge and information, curiosity is the enemy of many larger, older and more structured organizations — whether they admit it or not — because it hinders the production flow. Curiosity makes you pause and take time to explore and validate the “ask.” Asking as many what’s, how’s, why’s, who’s and how many’s as possible is important to help you learn if the work is worth your time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the key ingredients in effective product development is receiving timely and relevant notifications about customer use, engagement, potential issues and more. Engineers, developers and product managers rely on that flow of information, but it&#8217;s typically delivered either via legacy email tools, or through notification systems built into product management dashboards that devs have to hand-code themselves. <a href="https://magicbell.com">MagicBell</a>, a startup that just went through Y Combinator&#8217;s most recent Winter cohort, has raised a $1.9 million seed round to deliver a rich notification platform for product teams that&#8217;s easy to integrate and use.</p>
<p>The round was led by Cherry Ventures, and includes participation by a number of angel investors including Algolia co-founder Nicolas Dessaigne, Twitter Director of Product Management Marie Outtier, and Wunderlist and Pitch co-founder Christian Reber. This list itself is a great endorsement of the need for what MagicBell&#8217;s building, since it&#8217;s a storied collection of veteran experts who have ample experience actually building some of the world&#8217;s most engaging software products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sofia [Bendz], Partner at Cherry Ventures], of course, worked at Spotify,&#8221; explained MagicBell CEO and co-founder Hana Mohan in an interview. &#8220;She has built a consumer product, and she has invested in a lot of startups [&#8230;] we followed YC&#8217;s advice in this batch, which was to definitely leave some room in the round for strategic angels.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2145573" style="width: 516px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145573" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2145573" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?w=506" alt="MagicBell's Notification inbox" width="506" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png 1088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?resize=223,300 223w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?resize=768,1032 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?resize=506,680 506w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/magicbell-inbox.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2145573" class="wp-caption-text">An example of MagicBell&#8217;s Notification inbox.</p></div></p>
<p>That deep product experience on the cap table should serve MagicBell well as it seeks to grow the team, which currently consists of Mohan and co-founder Josue Montano. She and Montano previously worked on customer support ticketing system startup SupportBee, but found they were spending a lot of their time and effort on just building a notifications system for the platform. The greater opportunity, they realized, was in making that process plug-and-play, and scalable, since it&#8217;s something that can be intensely cost- and effort-intensive in setting up a new product, even though it&#8217;s also not anyone&#8217;s primary focus when building their software.</p>
<p>Basically everyone today is familiar and comfortable with a robust notification system — we use them constantly on our Android and iOS devices. Bu product teams use them, too, and the experience of doing so can add quite a bit of complexity and anxiety if they&#8217;re not handled well. MagicBell offers a notification inbox that&#8217;s embeddable into existing software via React, Javascript and REST (with additional frameworks in the pipeline), which provides real-time notification delivery, syncing of delivery and read status, individual user preference settings, and delivery across web, email and mobile clients.</p>
<p>Long term, the plan is to build MagicBell into a full-featured notification platform that offers a highly-customizable means of keeping your product team informed and in sync. Accordingly, the startup&#8217;s first priority with this initial funding is to hire engineers to help it build, says Mohan, and it&#8217;s also being driven by the product roadmaps of some of its initial customers — which coincidentally, includes a number of its investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the cool things for us was definitely that three or four of our customers ended up investing,&#8221; Mohan said, noting that <a href="https://pitch.com">Reber&#8217;s startup Pitch</a> was actually a customer before he decided to invest. &#8220;The other great thing about [Pitch] is that they have a pretty extensive roadmap themselves of launching a mobile offering, both on iOS and Android. So they&#8217;re really pushing the product forward, which is great for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mohan is also one of the inaugural guests on our <a href="http://pod.link/found">new podcast Found</a>, and you can <a href="http://apple.co/found">subscribe now</a> to get our episode with her when it becomes available on Friday. She goes into a lot more detail about YC, and the process of identifying the need for MagicBell in the market, plus plenty more, so be sure to tune in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year of pandemic living has been real-world, and sometimes harrowing, proof of how important it can be to have efficient and well-equipped emergency response services in place. They can help people remotely if need be, and when they cannot, they make sure that in-person help can be dispatched quickly in medical and other situations. Today, a company that&#8217;s building cloud-based tools to help with this process is announcing a round of funding as it continues to grow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rapiddeploy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RapidDeploy</a>, which provides computer-aided dispatch technology as a cloud-based service for 911 centers, has closed a round of $29 million, a Series B round of funding that will be used both to grow its business, and to continue expanding the SaaS tools that it provides to its customers. In the startup&#8217;s point of view, the cloud is essential to running emergency response in the most efficient manner.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;911 response would have been called out on a walkie talkie in the early days,&#8221; said Steve Raucher, the co-founder and CEO of RapidDeploy, in an interview. &#8220;Now the cloud has become the nexus of signals.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Washington, DC-based RapidDeploy provides data and analytics to 911 centers &#8212; the critical link between people calling for help and connecting those calls with the nearest medical, police or fire assistance &#8212; and today it has about 700 customers using its RadiusPlus, Eclipse Analytics and Nimbus CAD products.</p>
<p>That works out to about 10% of all 911 centers in the US (7,000 in total), and covering 35% of the population (there are more centers in cities and other dense areas). Its footprint includes state coverage in Arizona, California, and Kansas. It also has operations in South Africa, where it was originally founded.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from an interesting mix of financial and strategic investors. Led by Morpheus Ventures, the round also had participation from GreatPoint Ventures, Ericsson Ventures, Samsung Next Ventures, Tao Capital Partners, Tau Ventures, among others. It looks like the company had raised about $30 million before this latest round, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/265357-09/company/profile#board-members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. Valuation is not being disclosed.</p>
<p>Ericsson and Samsung, as major players in the communication industry, have a big stake in seeing through what will be the next generation of communications technology and how it is used for critical services. (And indeed, one of the big leaders in legacy and current 911 communications is Motorola, a would-be competitor of both.) AT&amp;T is also a strategic go-to-market (distribution and sales) partner of RapidDeploy&#8217;s, and it also has integrations with Apple, Google, Microsoft, and OnStar to feed data into its system.</p>
<p>The business of emergency response technology is a fragmented market. Raucher describes them as &#8220;mom-and-pop&#8221; businesses, with some 80% of them occupying four seats or less (a testament to the fact that a lot of the US is actually significantly less urban than its outsized cities might have you think it is), and in many cases a lot of these are operating on legacy equipment.</p>
<p>However, in the US in the last several years &#8212; buffered by innovations like the Jedi project and <a href="https://firstnet.gov/network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FirstNet</a>, a next-generation public safety network &#8212; things have been shifting. RapidDeploy&#8217;s technology sits alongside (and in some areas competes with) companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/carbyne-raises-25m-for-a-next-generation-platform-to-improve-emergency-911-responses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carbyne</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RapidSOS</a>, which have been tapping into the innovations of cell phone technology both to help pinpoint people and improve how to help them.</p>
<p>RapidDeploy&#8217;s tech is based around its RadiusPlus mapping platform, which uses d<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ata from smart phones, vehicles, home security systems and other connected devices and channels it to its data stream, which can help a center determine not just location but potentially other aspects of the condition of the caller. Its Eclipse Analytics services, meanwhile, are meant to act as a kind of assistant to those centers to help triage situations and provide insights into how to respond. The Nimbus CAD then helps figure out who to call out and routing for response. </span></p>
<p>Longer term, the plan will be to leverage cloud architecture to bring in new data sources and ways of communicating between callers, centers and emergency care providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about being more of a triage service rather than a message switch,&#8221; Raucher said. &#8220;As we see it, the platform will evolve with customers&#8217; needs. Tactical mapping ultimately is not big enough to cover this. We&#8217;re thinking about unified communications.&#8221; Indeed, that is the direction that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/technology/you-dont-need-flying-cars-to-save-lives.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many of these services seem to be going</a>, which can only be a good thing for us consumers.</p>
<p>“The future of emergency services is in data, which creates a faster, more responsive 9-1-1 center,” said Mark Dyne, Founding Partner at Morpheus Ventures, in a statement. “We believe that the platform RapidDeploy has built provides the necessary breadth of capabilities that make the dream of Next-Gen 9-1-1 service a reality for rural and metropolitan communities across the nation and are excited to be investing in this future with Steve and his team.” Dyne has joined the RapidDeploy board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Returnal</em>, released today for the PlayStation 5, is an action adventure that has you exploring an alien world that reconfigures itself whenever you die, bringing you back for another shot at escaping. It&#8217;s exciting, frustrating, and beautiful, though it isn&#8217;t particularly original. But while it is arguably the first game to be released that was designed and built for next generation consoles, it&#8217;s not the mainstream hit many gamers are waiting for.</p>
<p>First I should probably justify my &#8220;arguably.&#8221; The PS5 debuted with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/demons-souls-the-first-truly-next-gen-game-is-a-lopsided-but-impressive-showcase/">the impressive remake of <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em>,</a> and while I enjoyed that greatly, it was only next-gen in its presentation; many dated aspects faithfully carried over from the original mean it can&#8217;t really be considered a fully next generation title. The pack-in <em>Astro&#8217;s Playroom</em> is a delight but doesn&#8217;t compare with full-scale games. <em>Destruction All-Stars</em> was something of a damp squib. And excellent games like <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> and <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Valhalla</em> span the generations, playing best but by no means exclusively on PS5.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="n7pOq0JUhO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/demons-souls-the-first-truly-next-gen-game-is-a-lopsided-but-impressive-showcase/">Demon&#8217;s Souls: The first truly next-gen game is a lopsided but impressive showcase</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Demon&#8217;s Souls: The first truly next-gen game is a lopsided but impressive showcase&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/demons-souls-the-first-truly-next-gen-game-is-a-lopsided-but-impressive-showcase/embed/#?secret=n7pOq0JUhO" data-secret="n7pOq0JUhO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So <em>Returnal</em> really is, in a non-trivial way, the first <em>really</em> &#8220;next-gen&#8221; PS5 game — and it carries the &#8220;next-gen&#8221; PS5 price tag of $70, more in many regions. Can it justify this premium? In some ways yes, but like <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> this is a difficult game that involves a potentially off-putting amount of repetition and failure for mainstream audiences.</p>
<p>The game starts with your character, a sci-fi space explorer working for a mysterious company called Astra (there are clear nods to Weyland-Yutani from <em>Alien</em>), crashing on a forbidden planet and finding herself — literally — stuck in a sort of time loop. (You&#8217;ll see what I mean by literally.)</p>

<p>Without getting into the specifics of the plot, which is slowly revealed through found recordings, exploration of ancient ruins, and decoding alien symbols, Selene is seemingly trapped on the planet until she can figure out what&#8217;s going on, and whenever she dies the world shifts around to provide new challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>Each loop or &#8220;cycle&#8221; involves the player starting from the crash site and progressing through the world, different but familiar every time. You encounter enemies, collect power-ups like new weapons or artifacts that affect your abilities, and occasionally an item that will permanently augment your suit or open new paths to take.</p>
<p>To call any individual aspect of the game original would be inaccurate — it takes with a free hand from its august predecessors in both gameplay and presentation. Without spoiling too much I&#8217;d say its progression and design share the most with indie breakout hit <em>Dead Cells</em>, with a dose of <em>Risk of Rain 2,</em> and a setting <del>lifted wholesale from</del> elaborating on <em>Alien</em> and <em>Prometheus</em>. That said, the story and backstory owe more to <em>Solaris</em>. It wears its influences on its sleeve to be sure, but they come together as something cohesive, not a sloppy pastiche.</p>

<p><em>Returnal</em> starts out almost frustratingly simple, but this is soon remedied as new abilities and layers of complexity are added to the mix; expect the &#8220;tutorial&#8221; to be meted out over a few hours as things are discovered organically.</p>
<p>You make your way through what amounts to arena after arena, sometimes large and multi-layered, sometimes confined, and fight whatever appears. Combat is frantic and high risk — monsters don&#8217;t telegraph ponderous swipes at you but rather spew dozens or hundreds of bullets in your direction, making you rely on smart anticipatory movement and the cluttered landscape to stay alive. As you defeat them you accrue increasingly powerful boons that only last until you get hit, at which point they all disappear, adding a layer of urgency to every encounter: you could gain a crucial edge for the next miniboss — or lose what you&#8217;ve built up over minutes of careful play. You can&#8217;t take any enemy lightly — those that don&#8217;t kill you will make you weaker.</p>
<p>The player moves forward by exploring and eventually defeating an area boss, encounters that are more than a little taxing and generally take a few tries. Then it&#8217;s on to a new, different &#8220;biome&#8221; to do it all again with a different color scheme (and new enemies, hazards and so on).</p>
<p>The look and feel of <em>Returnal</em> is what you might call &#8220;early next-gen.&#8221; It&#8217;s detailed, interesting looking and realistic in a sci-fi way, and it uses lighting and color well to create both a sense of place and gameplay objectives. It&#8217;s better in some ways than what you&#8217;d expect from a PS4 or Xbox One game but ultimately the advances here seem to be more on the side of &#8220;fewer limitations&#8221; rather than &#8220;new capabilities.&#8221; Load times are practically non-existent — a second or two at most — and in places where sightlines are farther than a room or two, the scale of what&#8217;s being drawn is impressive. The framerate is a steady 60, making combat fluid no matter how crowded and chaotic it gets.</p>
<p>As for the claim of a &#8220;living world&#8221; that&#8217;s truly different every time, you can pretty much ignore that. You&#8217;ll encounter the same rooms and structures repeatedly, maybe with different enemies or items, but don&#8217;t expect a wildly different experience every loop. Just enough that the repetition isn&#8217;t too repetitious.</p>

<p>Sound is solid and I&#8217;d definitely recommend headphones. Your number one issue is going to be getting blasted in the back and positional audio will help a lot with that, as each enemy has characteristic noises for its actions.</p>
<p>The PS5 controller&#8217;s advanced haptics are put to good use with two-stage virtual triggers and a lot of contextual vibrations. I do wish there was a way to control these with a bit more granularity, as the constant patter of rain in the first area was numbing my hands, but the other haptic cues were useful and quickly became second nature.</p>
<p>Games in the &#8220;roguelite&#8221; (i.e. you start from scratch every life like a roguelike, but occasionally gain permanent upgrades) genre can fall flat if your progression, either within a loop or over many of them, involves little more than &#8220;+4% pistol damage&#8221; or a few more hit points. Fortunately <em>Returnal</em> is well aware of this and its weapons, artifacts, perks and so on often confer interesting bonuses or risk/reward mechanics. And you only have one weapon at a time, meaning the choice between, say, an assault rifle with special ability A and a shotgun with special ability B is a complex and risky one.</p>
<p>Eventually you&#8217;ll be able to skip past certain areas, but you may not want to, preferring to scour side paths for resources so you&#8217;re not going into the next boss room naked and afraid. In general the game manages to keep a lot of interesting tensions going on with the player that make every decision consequential, not to say agonizing.</p>
<h2>Next-gen price tag</h2>
<p>Is <em>Returnal</em> worth its premium $70 asking price? For some people, yes. But this isn&#8217;t the kind of mainstream blockbuster that would ordinarily justify the increased cost.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve played about 20 hours, done 30-odd runs, and based on what I know I&#8217;m about halfway through the game. Most of my progress was made on what I think of &#8220;prestige&#8221; runs, the handful where everything goes right and I get much further than before, making them tense and exciting. (Many ended within five minutes due to poor momentum or rage quits.) The game promises replay value past the credits, though, so a guess of 40 hours of content is more of a floor than a ceiling.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144033" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144033" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144033" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/returnal-ps5-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144033" class="wp-caption-text">One of several trips to your house, inexplicably replicated on the alien planet&#8230;</p></div></p>
<p>The difficulty may present a barrier to many players. A dialogue at the start of the game warns you that the game is meant to be challenging and that death is part of the journey. Great, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less frustrating when you get ambushed by a dozen enemies, wiping out half an hour of of progress in an instant. While generally the game falls into the &#8220;tough but fair&#8221; category, there are spikes here and there that feel gratuitous, and loops where you feel unlucky or underpowered and have to fight the urge to reset.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind personally — compared to the <em>Dark Souls</em> series it&#8217;s a cakewalk. I almost beat the first boss on my first encounter; good luck doing that with Ornstein and Smough or Father Gascoigne! But like those games it takes a certain type of player to <em>want to</em> power through the early hours and access the huge amount of value essentially locked behind repeated failure. Similar to how many <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> players never progress past that game&#8217;s punishing first area, players not ready for the acrobatics and perseverance necessary to traverse the unforgiving bullet hell of <em>Returnal</em> may never escape its gloomy, restrictive first biome for the bright, open second one or glimpse its intriguing backstory. (I&#8217;ve included some tips below to help people get through the first hours.)</p>
<p>Compared with the steady progression and traditional storytelling of something like <em>AC: Valhalla</em> or <em>Miles Morales</em> this may put off less masochistic gamers or prompt more than a few controller-throwing, refund-requesting moments. After all, paying $70 for a game that slaps you in the face while you try to access the latter $50 worth of it can be justifiably frustrating.</p>
<p>With all that said, it is nice to see a AAA next-generation game that isn&#8217;t a sequel or franchise, and seeing the &#8220;roguelite&#8221; formula embraced seriously beyond the indie world. <em>Returnal</em> may not be for everyone, but for the subset of gamers who have embraced this genre for years, it&#8217;s an easy one to recommend.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Tips for playing:</strong></p>
<p>If you do decide to dive in, here are a handful of non-spoilery &#8220;wish I&#8217;d known that&#8221; tips to get you on the right track.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are lots of hidden rooms and items, so check your mini-map frequently for things you&#8217;ve missed in the chaos and peek in every nook and cranny.</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re undamaged, healing pickups contribute towards adding crucial max health — one more reason to not get hit.</li>
<li>New abilities create new opportunities in old areas — there&#8217;s a reason so much of the first biome is inaccessible at first.</li>
<li>You can get to those treasures behind bars. Look around carefully (and shoot everything).</li>
<li>&#8220;Malignant&#8221; treasure is usually more trouble than it&#8217;s worth and the debuffs can sink a run. Only do if desperate or you have a cure handy. (Parasites on the other hand can be very useful.)</li>
<li>There&#8217;s always a healing item for sale at the biome&#8217;s &#8220;shop,&#8221; so there&#8217;s no excuse for going into a boss room without one. (And self-healing artifacts will save your life five times over.)</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">Zynga bought hyper-casual game maker Rollic</a>. Today, <a href="https://rollicgames.com">Rollic</a> is a Zynga subsidiary, and it&#8217;s announcing the acquisition of another game studio called <a href="https://www.uncosoft.com">Uncosoft</a>.</p>
<p>Like Rollic, Uncosoft develops hyper-casual games and is based in Turkey (Istanbul in Rollic&#8217;s case, Izmir in Uncosoft&#8217;s). In fact, Rollic has already published a couple of Uncosoft games, most notably High Heels, in which the player navigates an obstacle course in increasingly ridiculous high heels — the company said High Heels (or, if you insist, High Heels!) has been downloaded more than 60 million times since it launched in January, and it&#8217;s even been praised for bringing <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/high-heels-app-game-queer-joy">&#8220;queer joy to the top of the App Store charts.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Rollic co-founder and CEO Burak Vardal told me that when you&#8217;re in the hyper-casual gaming business, you&#8217;re &#8220;always looking for product-oriented teams.&#8221; And it sounds like Vardal is impressed by what he&#8217;s seen of the Uncosoft team, making him confident that it can successfully build &#8220;new titles like High Heels.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Producing a game together as development studio and publisher, you already start working like a merged company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You argue about game design all day, you share strategies [&#8230;] and you — not on purpose — start learning about how that company operates, how are the founders, how is the art team.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Uncosoft CEO Edip Enes Çakır said in a statement that there has been &#8220;unprecedented harmony&#8221; between the two teams as they&#8217;ve worked together in recent years, and that &#8220;our culture and vision of making global games will be augmented with the expertise of Rollic and Zynga.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rollic was actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">Zynga&#8217;s fourth acquisition in Istanbul</a>, so it&#8217;s clear that the city and country are becoming a bit of a hub. Vardal said Rollic does have partners outside of Turkey, but he suggested that the country has been particularly successful with hyper-casual games because of <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/education/2018/09/18/number-of-students-in-turkey-surpasses-population-of-143-countries">its huge student population</a>.</p>
<p>Verdal also suggested that High Heels points to a path that other hyper-casual games might follow to success: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/8/22272980/high-heels-tiktok-ios-app-store-free-game">namely, TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The animations of the game and the character mechanic are what we call TikTok-able,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It had a huge impact in Gen Z and huge organic reach in TikTok [&#8230;] The new generation wants content that feeds that ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched another batch of Starlink satellites, adding 60 more to the constellation on orbit. This is the 24th Starlink launch in total, and means SpaceX has now sent up over 1,500 Starlink spacecraft, with around 1,438 of those still in operation. This is the first Starlink launch since April 7 — which, surprisingly, is the biggest gap between these launches in quite a while.</p>
<p>This year, SpaceX&#8217;s overall launch calendar has been dominated by Starlink launches, as the company seeks to expand the availability, quality and coverage of its low Earth orbit broadband internet network. SpaceX also opened up availability of Starlink service this year, and now seems to be mostly supply-constrained on the consumer receiver terminal side, rather than necessarily on network capacity or regional ability.</p>
<p>Regarding that few week gap in the Starlink launch pace, it&#8217;s not like SpaceX was slacking in the meantime; the launcher sent up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/spacex-successfully-launches-astronauts-with-a-re-used-dragon-spacecraft-for-the-first-time/">second crew of astronauts destined for the International Space Station in a flight just last week</a>. Plus, it has two three additional Starlink launches tentatively scheduled to happen in May.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://vivid.money">Vivid Money</a> has raised a new $73 million Series B funding round (€60 million) led by Greenoaks with existing investor Ribbit Capital also participating. Following today’s funding round, Vivid Money has reached a valuation of $436 million (€360 million).</p>
<p>Vivid Money could be considered as a Revolut competitor designed specifically for the Eurozone. Built on top of <a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/en/">Solarisbank</a> for the banking infrastructure, the company lets you send, receive, spend, invest and save money in different ways.</p>
<p>When you create an account, you get a German IBAN that starts with DE as well as a metal card. There are no card details on the card itself —&nbsp;everything is available in the app instead. Like other fintech startups, Vivid Money lets you control your card from the app —&nbsp;you can lock it and unlock it, add it to Google Pay and Apple Pay, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can top up your account and hold dozens of different currencies. When you pay with your card abroad, the startup applies a small mark-up on the current exchange rate — you should get a better exchange rate than what you usually get with a regular bank.</p>
<p>In addition to this fairly standard feature set, Vivid Money offers stock trading with fractional shares. You can invest in stocks and ETFs and there’s no commission. Similarly, you can buy, hold and share cryptocurrencies from the app. The startup has partnered with CM Equity AG for those features.</p>
<p>The company also has a <a href="https://vivid.money/en-de/cashback/">cashback program</a> and a premium subscription for €9.90 per month. Paid users get higher limits on free cash withdrawals, the ability to create a virtual card, support for additional currencies and better cashback rewards.</p>
<p>Finally, users can create sub-accounts called pockets. You can move money around from one pocket to another and add other users to your pockets. Each pocket has its own IBAN, which means that you can pay for certain bills with a separate pocket. You can also associate your card with a specific pocket for upcoming purchases.</p>
<p>Vivid Money has managed to add a ton of features in no time. It now has a ton of money on its bank account. Now let’s see if it can attract a significant user base to compete with other, well-established European fintech players.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The pandemic has hammered the travel sector over the past 12 months so you&#8217;d be forgiven for feeling a bit of pre-COVID-19 déjà vu at this news: Business trip booking platform TravelPerk is announcing a $160M Series D. The round, which is a mix of equity and debt funding, is led by London-based growth equity [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/three-travel-startups-tell-us-how-theyre-responding-to-the-coronavirus-crisis/">pandemic</a> has hammered the travel sector over the past 12 months so you&#8217;d be forgiven for feeling a bit of pre-COVID-19 déjà vu at this news: Business trip booking platform <a href="https://www.travelperk.com">TravelPerk</a> is announcing a $160M Series D.</p>
<p>The round, which is a mix of equity and debt funding, is led by London-based growth equity firm Greyhound Capital. Existing investors also participated (specifically: DST, Kinnevik, Target Global, Felix Capital, Spark Capital, Heartcore, LocalGlobe and Amplo).</p>
<p>No valuation is being disclosed, nor is the split between equity and debt. So it&#8217;s a bit more of a convoluted &#8216;vote of confidence&#8217; vs TravelPerk&#8217;s pre-pandemic raises &#8212; as you&#8217;d expect given the locked down year we&#8217;ve all had.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series D means the 2015-founded Barcelona-based startup has pulled in a total of $294M to-date for its user-friendly retooling of business trip booking geared toward &#8216;global SMEs&#8217;, following a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/on-a-growth-tear-work-trip-saas-travelperk-adds-60m-to-its-series-c/"> top-up of $60M </a>(in 2019) to its 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/travelperk-grabs-44m-to-take-its-pain-free-saas-for-business-travel-global/">$44M Series C</a> &#8212; which itself fast-followed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/travelperk-grabs-21m-to-make-booking-business-trips-suck-less/">$21M Series B that same year</a>.</p>
<p>TravelPerk&#8217;s approach is akin to a consumerization play for the (non-enterprise end of) business trip booking, combining what it bills as &#8220;the world’s largest bookable travel inventory&#8221; &#8212; letting users compare, book and invoice trains, cars, flights, hotels and apartments from a range of providers including Kayak, Skyscanner, Expedia, Booking.com, and Airbnb &#8212; with tools for businesses to manage and report trips.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the obligatory freemium tier for the smallest teams. It also offers 24/7 traveler support, a flexible booking option and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/travelperk-launches-an-open-api-platform-to-extend-its-work-trip-saas/">open API</a> for custom integrations.</p>
<p>There was no funding announcement for TravelPerk in 2020, as investors took a break from the pandemic-struck sector. But earlier this year it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">told TechCrunch</a> it had been starting to see interest picking up again, as of fall 2020. The closing of a Series D now &#8212; albeit debt and equity &#8212; suggests VCs are getting over the worst of their travel wobbles.</p>
<p>(Another sign on that front is the $155M Series E raise for U.S.-based TripActions, which closed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/tripactions-raises-155m-at-5b-valuation-as-corporate-travel-recovers-from-pandemic-lows/">January</a> on a $5BN valuation, as U.S. corporate travel lifted off from 2020&#8217;s lows.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TripActions raises $155M at $5B valuation as corporate travel recovers from pandemic lows&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/tripactions-raises-155m-at-5b-valuation-as-corporate-travel-recovers-from-pandemic-lows/embed/#?secret=jtAhLUlY3q" data-secret="jtAhLUlY3q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TravelPerk&#8217;s PR talks bullishly about momentum and using the funds to accelerate &#8216;global growth&#8217;, even as the coronavirus continues to hit parts of Europe and the U.S. &#8212; its two main markets &#8212; despite what are relatively advanced vaccination rollouts (especially the US) vs other parts of the world.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, COVID-19 is taking a particularly heavy toll on India, where the health system looks to be careening out of control in the face of a massive wave of infections. Parts of Latin America are also struggling. A third of the way through 2021 the pandemic looks far from done. And that makes for a still uncertain outlook for business travel over the coming months.</p>
<p>The typical pre-pandemic business trip is now a Zoom call, while former conference calls may have morphed into emails or group chatter in Slack. And there&#8217;s no immediate reason for that to change, given remote-working professionals have had a year to adjust to a richer mix of digital comms tools.</p>
<p>In 2021 it&#8217;s hard to imagine an overwhelming return for business travel &#8212; not least as plenty of offices remain shuttered. The contagion risk vs hard-to-quantify in-person networking rewards associated with non-essential business trips will surely see work trips remaining a hard sell for a lot of companies.</p>
<p>Still, TravelPerk and its investors are willing to bet that work trips will rebound &#8212; in time.</p>
<p>The plan is to be ready to meet what it expects will be a far more &#8216;moveable feast&#8217; of business travel demand in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travel is definitely coming back,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder, Avi Meir. &#8220;We can see that already with the numbers. In the US for instance, we can see a 70-75% recovery in domestic flights compared to the baseline before COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Europe it’s a little less certain right now, as vaccine rollout isn’t as fast, but you can look to other parts of the world and with some degree of certainty predict what the European recovery will eventually look like by looking at those examples.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect the overall global recovery in travel to be uneven over the next year, with different countries reopening at different times, meaning constantly changing guidelines and restrictions,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue living in a stage of uncertainty probably for the next 12 months or longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve realised from speaking to our customers that the demand for travel is there, people are eager to do these trips, but this period of uncertainty makes it difficult for them so we’re focused on finding solutions that can address that.&#8221;</p>
<p>TravelPerk didn&#8217;t sit on its hands last year as global business travel cratered. Instead, it focused on investing in product development, making bets on how it needs to tool up for the new climate of increased uncertainty &#8212; including by taking<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> a number of steps toward making its business more resilient to the ravages of COVID-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last October it </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/travelperk-launches-an-api-for-covid-19-restrictions/">launched an API</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; saying it wanted to help the wider travel industry access up to date info on coronavirus restrictions. It also picked up a risk management startup, called Albatross, back in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.travelperk.com/press-release/travelperk-acquires-startup-albatross-to-boost-travel-risk-management-offering/">July</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, to feed its own resilience efforts.</span></p>
<p>Another more recent acquisition was geared toward scaling its business in the U.S. &#8212; where domestic travel looks to be recovering faster than Europe. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">January</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> it announced it was buying YC-backed rival NexTravel &#8212; gaining a base in Chicago.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TLtH79jTXL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">Business trip platform TravelPerk buys YC-backed rival NexTravel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Business trip platform TravelPerk buys YC-backed rival NexTravel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/embed/#?secret=TLtH79jTXL" data-secret="TLtH79jTXL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At the same time, it inked a partnership with Southwest Airlines to plug a key gap in its U.S. offering.</span></p>
<p>Meir avoids breaking out any revenue growth projections for the U.S. or Europe for this year or next, when we ask, which suggests he&#8217;s preparing for lean growth in the short term.</p>
<p>What he does say is that investors were impressed TravelPerk managed to grow its customer base 2x in 2020 (it now has 3,000+ businesses using its platform, including a bunch of familiar startup names) &#8212; and that it avoided making layoffs (when other travel businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/tripactions-reportedly-lays-off-hundreds-amid-covid-19-travel-freeze/">swung the axe</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year we doubled the size of our customer-base and we now have over 3,000 businesses using the platform, including the likes of Wise, Farfetch, GetYourGuide and Monzo. The travel budget under management also increased by almost 100% over the last 12 months,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason we had such interest from investors with this round is because we had, given the context, a really good 2020. We doubled our customer base, avoided making layoffs, and most importantly we were there for our customers when they needed us, constantly investing in the product to enable safe travel during Covid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thesis TravelPerk is now working to is that &#8220;flexibility, safety and sustainability&#8221; will be more important than ever for business travellers, per Meir.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flexibility, because travel still has a lot of friction due to the different restrictions and travel lockdowns mean that a trip could be cancelled at really short notice,&#8221; says Meir. &#8220;Safety, so that every traveler knows not only what specific health requirements are in place at their destination, but also that they will get updates in real time if anything changes. Sustainability, because in this period businesses have been taking stock and realising that we all have to do more in terms of our environmental impact &#8212; and of course travel is a big part of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have worked hard to respond quickly to these requirements,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;We updated our product and product roadmap to better match these new needs. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/travelperk-launches-flexible-refunds-to-help-businesses-save-on-cancelled-trips/">flexible booking tool FlexiPerk</a> [which TravelPerk happened to launch pre-pandemic, in summer 2019] guarantees refunds on cancelled trips at short notice; our risk-management API TravelSafe keeps travellers updated in real time on local health guidelines and restrictions; and GreenPerk, our sustainability tool, directly reduces carbon emissions through initiatives run by our partner Atmosfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sustainability and business travel aren&#8217;t a natural pairing, however. Certainly not for air travel &#8212; where environmental groups accuse carbon offsetting schemes of boiling down to &#8216;greenwashing&#8217; when what&#8217;s really needed to achieve a reduction in CO2e emissions is for people to take fewer flights.</p>
<p>TravelPerk launched its GreenPerk offsetting scheme in February 2020, letting customers pay a fee per carbon tonne to cover its guesstimate of the total emissions toll their trip will generate. But it&#8217;s only been applied to 10% of its business volume so far.</p>
<p>With 90% <em>not</em> <em>even being offset</em>, you hardly need to be Greta Thunberg to call that the opposite of &#8216;sustainable&#8217;.</p>
<p>Still, Meir says he expects the offset percentage to &#8220;grow rapidly&#8221;. &#8220;We intend to use this funding to develop GreenPerk even further,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;We want to be the standard bearer for the industry in terms of sustainable business travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>However when asked whether TravelPerk might seek to advance sustainability by supporting digital replacement itself (such as by being able to offer its users videoconferencing as an alternative to flying) he declines to comment, saying: &#8220;We don’t have anything to share yet on how we’ll advance that goal [sustainability] right now, but we’re working on some exciting ideas!&#8221;</p>
<p>Coming up with creative ways to reduce the need for business travel certainly doesn&#8217;t feature in TravelPerk&#8217;s near term vision.</p>
<p>Meir predicts a &#8220;full comeback&#8221; for business travel &#8212; arguing that &#8220;the meetings that matter happen in person&#8221; &#8212; while conceding that the travel industry will nonetheless be very different. (Hence its goal of &#8220;building the products for that [more flexible] future&#8221;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to double down on growth in the U.S. and Europe and that includes making key hires across all roles, especially in our hubs in Chicago, London, and Barcelona,&#8221; he says, adding that it expects the team to grow &#8220;rapidly&#8221; in the next 12-24 months (without putting any numbers on the planned hires).</p>
<p>TravelPerk will also continue to eye acquisition targets, per Meir. &#8220;Following our first two acquisitions, of Albatross and NexTravel, this funding round will also help us to continue being aggressive in our growth strategy. We aim to complete more acquisitions this year,&#8221; he says on that. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Whilst many other providers have been in hibernation over the past year, we’ve been aggressive, continuing to update our product and growing our customer base, and we think that gives us a great foundation for growth in 2021 and beyond,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series D in a statement, Pogos Saiadian, investor at Greyhound Capital, said: “There is no doubt that from 2021 onwards the average business trip will look very different to how it did in 2019. We are confident that business travel will recover and thrive in the years ahead. We also believe that people will, more than ever before, need a platform like TravelPerk that has deep inventory, excellent ‘seven-star’ customer service, provides a great traveler experience and integrates with the broader tech-stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that this is a huge long-term opportunity, and as customers ourselves, we see first-hand the tremendous value that TravelPerk provides across organizations, from finance to admin and the travellers themselves. The fact the company is beating growth expectations already for this year further supports our belief that TravelPerk is a true market leader, and we are delighted to be supporting the next stage of the company’s growth with this investment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament approved a new law on terrorist content takedowns yesterday, paving the way for one-hour removals to become the legal standard across the EU.</p>
<p>The regulation &#8220;addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online&#8221; will come into force shortly after publication in the EU&#8217;s Official Journal &#8212; and start applying 12 months after that.</p>
<p>The incoming regime means providers serving users in the region must act on terrorist content removal notices from Member State authorities within one hour of receipt, or else provide an explanation why they have been unable to do so.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span class="ep_name">There are exceptions for educational, research, artistic and journalistic work &#8212; with lawmakers aiming to target terrorism propaganda being spread on online platforms like social media sites.</span></p>
<p>The types of content they want speedily removed under this regime includes material that incites, solicits or contributes to terrorist offences; provides instructions for such offences; or solicits people to participate in a terrorist group.</p>
<p>Material posted online that provides guidance on how to make and use explosives, firearms or other weapons for terrorist purposes is also in scope.</p>
<p><span class="ep_name">However concerns have been raised over the impact on online freedom of expression &#8212; including if platforms use content filters to shrink their risk, given the tight turnaround times required for removals. </span></p>
<p><span class="ep_name">The law does not put a general obligation on platforms to monitor or filter content but it does push service providers to prevent the spread of proscribed content &#8212; saying they must take steps to prevent propagation. </span></p>
<p><span class="ep_name">It is left up to service providers how exactly they do that, and while there&#8217;s </span><span class="ep_name">no legal obligation to use automated tools it seems likely filters will be what larger providers reach for, with the risk of unjustified, speech chilling takedowns fast-following. </span></p>
<p><span class="ep_name">Another concern is how exactly terrorist content is being defined under the law &#8212; with <a href="https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/terrorist-content-regulation-open-letter-to-meps/43410">civil rights groups warning</a> that authoritarian governments within Europe might seek to use it to go after critics based elsewhere in the region.</span></p>
<p>The law does include transparency obligations &#8212; meaning providers must publicly report information about content identification and takedown actions annually.</p>
<p>On the sanctions side, Member States are responsible for adopting rules on penalties but the regulation sets a top level of fines for repeatedly failing to comply with provisions at up to 4% of global annual turnover.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers proposed the new rules<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/europe-to-push-for-one-hour-takedown-law-for-terrorist-content/"> back in 2018 </a> when concern was riding high over the spread of ISIS content online.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech giants told to remove extremist content much faster&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/tech-giants-told-to-remove-extremist-content-much-faster/embed/#?secret=dJdjM3eglA" data-secret="dJdjM3eglA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Platforms were pressed to abide by an informal one-hour takedown rule in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/02/social-media-handed-one-hour-rule-for-terrorist-takedowns-in-europe/">March</a> of the same year. But within months the Commission came with a more expansive <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-preventing-terrorist-content-online-regulation-640_en.pdf">proposal</a> for a regulation aimed at “preventing the dissemination of terrorist content online”.</p>
<p>Negotiations over the proposal have seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/one-hour-terrorist-takedowns-backed-by-eu-parliaments-civil-liberties-committee/">MEPs</a> and Member States (via the Council) tweaking provisions &#8212; with the former, for example, pushing for a provision that requires competent authority to contact companies that have never received a removal order a little in advance of issuing the first order to remove content &#8212; to provide them with information on procedures and deadlines &#8212; so they&#8217;re not caught entirely on the hop.</p>
<p>The impact on smaller content providers has continued to be a concern for critics, though.</p>
<p>The Council <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/03/16/terrorist-content-online-council-adopts-new-rules/">adopted its final position</a> in March. The approval by the Parliament yesterday concludes the co-legislative process.</p>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">Commenting in a statement, MEP Patryk JAKI, the rapporteur for the legislation, said: “Terrorists recruit, share propaganda and coordinate attacks on the internet. Today we have established effective mechanisms allowing member states to remove terrorist content within a maximum of one hour all around the European Union. I strongly believe that what we achieved is a good outcome, which balances security and freedom of speech and expression on the internet, protects legal content and access to information for every citizen in the EU, while fighting terrorism through cooperation and trust between states.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.paxos.com">Paxos</a> has raised a $300 million Series D funding round led by Oak HC/FT. With today’s funding the round, the company is now valued at $2.4 billion. The company has been building infrastructure and white-label services for enterprise clients that want to offer cryptocurrency products to their own customers.</p>
<p>In particular, Paxos has partnered with PayPal for its cryptocurrency features. Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/paypal-to-let-you-buy-and-sell-cryptocurrencies-in-the-us/">October 2020</a>, PayPal customers have been able to buy, hold and sell a handful of crypto assets —&nbsp;Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Venmo, a PayPal subsidiary, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">added</a> the same cryptocurrency features just a few days ago.</p>
<p>Investors in today’s funding round include Declaration Partners, PayPal Ventures, Mithril Capital, Senator Investment Group, Liberty City Ventures and WestCap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paxos offers different products, such crypto trading and settlement, custody and the ability to issue tokens. It focuses on big enterprise clients, such as Revolut, Crédit Suisse, Société Générale and StoneX.</p>
<p>The company tries to be as compliant as possible. And it plans to remain committed to regulation across several geographies and verticals.</p>
<p>For instance, Paxos plans to launch the Paxos National Trust Bank and to apply for a Clearing Agency registration with the SEC in the U.S. In Singapore, the company is applying for a Major Payment Institution license. Paxos thinks that this regulation edge will foster partnerships with more enterprise clients looking for safe cryptocurrency opportunities.</p>
<p>Paxos has also launched its own stablecoin called Paxos Standard (PAX). Stablecoins are crypto assets like BTC or ETH. But the value of PAX is indexed on USD. At any point in time, one PAX is worth one USD. Other popular stablecoins include Tether and USDC.</p>
<p>The company also lets you issue your own branded stablecoin. For instance, Binance has worked with Paxos to issue BUSD on its platform. As expected, one BUSD is also worth one USD.</p>
<p>Paxos is also well known for PAX Gold, a digital asset that is backed by physical gold. It’s an alternative to gold ETFs that should be more efficient as it lives on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Finally, Paxos has its own cryptocurrency exchange called <a href="https://www.paxos.com/itbit/">itBit</a>. According to CoinMarketCap, itBit only <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/itbit/">features</a> a handful of trading trading pairs. It isn’t meant to be a consumer-facing exchange but it powers Paxos’ other products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.taster.com">Taster</a> has raised a $37 million Series B funding round from Octopus Venture, Battery Ventures, Latitude (LocalGlobe), HeartCore, Rakuten, GFC and Founders Future. The company operates dozens of restaurants that only exist on food delivery platforms. You can’t book a table as there is no table.</p>
<p>Taster has been focusing on five street food-inspired concepts so far —&nbsp;Bian Dang (Taiwanese food), A Burgers (plant-based burgers), Mission Saigon (Vietnamese food), Out Fry (Korean food) and Stacksando (Japanese street food). After that, Taster has opened dozens of kitchens across 40 different cities and listed its kitchens on food delivery platforms, such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats.</p>
<p>Essentially, the startup wants to build new restaurant chains for the 21st century. Instead of opening brick-and-mortar restaurants, Taster focuses on food delivery as it’s still a booming segment. In Paris, Taster restaurants are the third restaurant group on Deliveroo behind McDonald’s and Burger King —&nbsp;it represents over 5,000 meals per day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After operating its own kitchens, Taster now wants to partner with existing restaurants that don’t get a lot of orders on Deliveroo or Uber Eats. Taster brings its own native brands and menus as well as its tech tools.</p>
<p>Taster has built its own delivery app for Android and iOS. But you can still find Taster’s restaurants on third-party platforms. The startup doesn’t want to reinvent the wheel and replace food ordering platforms. But it makes sense to offer its service to end customers directly.</p>
<p>As Taster brands become more and more familiar, it should create demand from day one —&nbsp;restaurants can expect between €4,000 and €6,000 in revenue during the first week. By 2025, Taster wants to operate in 1,000 cities thanks to this partnership model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Institutions need to keep their crypto assets somewhere. And they aren’t going to keep it on some random, or consumer-grade crypto operation. This requires more sophisticated technology. Furthermore, being in the EU is going to be a key barrier to entry for many US or Asia-based operations.</p>
<p>Thus it is that Berlin-based digital asset custody and financial services platform<br />
<a href="https://www.finoa.io/">Finoa</a>, has closed a $22 million Series A funding round, to do just that.</p>
<p>The round was led by Balderton Capital, alongside existing investors Coparion, Venture Stars and Signature Ventures, as well as an undisclosed investor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Crucially, the Berlin-based startup works with Dapper Lab’s FLOW protocol, NEAR, and Mina, which are fast becoming standards for crypto assets. They are going up against large players such as Anchorage, Coinbase Custody, Bitgo, exchanges like Binance and Kraken, and self-custody solutions like Ledger.</p>
<p>Finoa says it now has over 250 customers, including T-Systems, DeFi-natives like CoinList and financial institutions like Bankhaus Scheich.</p>
<p>The company says its plan is to become a regulated platform for institutional investors and corporations to manage their digital assets and it has received a preliminary crypto custody license and is supervised by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2018 by Christopher May and Henrik Ebbing, but both had previously worked together at McKinsey and started working in blockchain in 2017.</p>
<p>May commented: “We are proud to have established Finoa as Europe’s leading gateway for institutional participation and incredibly excited to accelerate our growth even further. We look forward to supporting new exciting protocols and projects, empowering innovative corporate use cases, and adding additional (decentralized) financial products and services to our platform.”</p>
<p>Colin Hanna, Principal at Balderton Capital, who leads most of Balderton&#8217;s Crypto investments, said: “Chris, Henrik, and the entire Finoa team have built a deeply impressive business which bridges the highest levels of professionalism with radical innovation. As custodians of digital asset private keys, Finoa needs to be trusted both with the secure management of those keys and with the products and services that allow their clients to fully leverage the power of native digital assets. The team they have assembled is uniquely positioned to do just that.” </p>
<p>May added: “We identified a lack of sophisticated custody and asset servicing solutions for safeguarding and managing blockchain-based digital assets that successfully cover the needs of institutional investors. Finoa is bridging this gap by providing seamless, safe, and regulated access to the world of digital assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Being in the European Union requires a fundamentally different organizational setup, and poses a very high entry to new incumbents and other players overseas. There are few that have managed to do what Finoa has done in a European context and hence why we now see ourselves in a leading position.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei&#8217;s smartphone rivals in China are quickly divvying up the market share it has lost over the past year.</p>
<p>92.4 million units of smartphones were shipped in China during the first quarter, with Vivo claiming the crown with a 23% share and its sister company Oppo following closely behind with 22%, according to market research firm <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/China-smartphone-market-Q1-2021?ctid=2041-5814e927aabab0e63f5070cbd38a12b6">Canalys</a>. Huawei, of which smartphone sales took a hit after U.S. sanctions cut key chip parts off its supply chain, came in third at 16%. Xiaomi and Apple took the fourth and fifth spot respectively.</p>
<p>All major smartphone brands but Huawei saw a jump in their market share in China from Q1 2020. Apple&#8217;s net sales in Greater China nearly doubled year-over-year to $17.7 billion in the three months ended March, a quarter of all-time record revenue for the American giant, according to its latest <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY21_Q2_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf">financial results</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been especially pleased by the customer response in China to the iPhone 12 family,&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422230-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-on-q2-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript">said</a> Tim Cook during an earnings call this week. &#8220;You have to remember that China entered the shutdown phase earlier in Q2 of last year than other countries. And so they were relatively more affected in that quarter, and that has to be taken into account as you look at the results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s share shrunk from a dominant 41% to 16% in a year&#8217;s time, though the telecom equipment giant managed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-huawei-reports-drop-q1-revenue-smartphone-income-hit-2021-04-28/">increase its profit margin</a> partly thanks to slashed costs. In November, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/">sold off its budget phone line Honor</a>.</p>
<p>This quarter is also the first time China&#8217;s smartphone market has grown in four years, with a growth rate of 27%, according to Canalys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leading vendors are racing to the top of the market, and there was an unusually high number of smartphone launches this quarter compared with Q1 2020 or even Q4 2020,&#8221; said Canalys analyst Amber Liu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huawei’s sanctions and Honor’s divestiture have been hallmarks of this new market growth, as consumers and channels become more open to alternative brands.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indonesia is one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the world, but consumer data is still hard to find for many businesses, especially smaller ones. <a href="https://www.info.populix.co/">Populix</a> wants to make research easier for companies, through a respondent app that now has 250,000 users in 300 Indonesian cities. The startup announced today it has raised $1.2 million in an oversubscribed pre-Series A round led by returning investor Intudo Ventures, with participation from Quest Ventures.</p>
<p>Populix has now raised a total of $2.3 million since it was founded in January 2018, including a $1 million seed round also led by Intudo. The company’s revenue grew five times in 2020 and it signed up 52 new enterprise clients in 10 countries, as the COVID-19 pandemic limited traditional forms of consumer surveys, like in-person questionnaires. Its customers range in size from tech startups to multinational conglomerates.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used for product launches, marketing and hiring. Populix is currently in the process of launching a self-service product called Paket Hemat Populix (PHP) for clients like SMEs or university researchers that want to conduct their own surveys and monitor results in real time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company’s co-founders are chief executive officer Timothy Astandu, chief operating officer Eileen Kamtawijoyo and chief technical officer Jonathan Benhi. Astandu and Kamtawijoyo met while both were graduate students in business management at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>“When we were studying, we looked at developed markets, and in developed markets, consumer insights is such a big thing that all the brands are using it already,” said Astandu. “But it’s something that’s not available in developing countries like Indonesia,” where many companies still conduct research offline d<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/indonesia-new-frontier-mobile-marketing/">espite its very high smartphone engagement rates</a>. For example, if a coffee brand wants to understand consumer sentiment, it will send people with surveys into a cafe or grocery store and ask customers to fill them out in return for a small gift.</p>
<p>“We felt it was important to do consumer sentiment in Indonesia, because it’s going to be a big market and Indonesia has seen very little innovation so far,” Astandu added. “That gives us a chance to disrupt it, in the sense that it has always catered to the big clients. It’s always the multinationals in Indonesia that buy it, but you are seeing an emerging middle class, a lot of SMEs and perhaps they actually need research and data more than big companies.”</p>
<p>After returning to Indonesia, Astandu and Kamtawijoyo began working on a more accurate and accessible alternative to traditional surveys, developing Populix while part of Gojek’s Xcelerate program. Then they met Benhi, who was previously an engineer at Discuss.io, a Seattle-based video platform for consumer research.</p>
<p>Populix’s clients conduct research through its respondent app, also called Populix, which keeps users engaged through daily polls, games and news, in return for incentives like cash offers or rebate programs. Populix can be customized for a wide range of research, ranging from short surveys to longitudinal studies that take place over a period of time, and is used to track brand health, prepare for product launches or gauge customer satisfaction. For example, a coffee brand used Populix to see how it was doing compared to competitors on a monthly basis and study consumer reactions before launching a ready-to-drink coffee. E-commerce companies have also used it to ask people where they shop online, what they look for and how they feel about the customer experience on different platforms.</p>
<p>“We can speed up the recruitment process, because we already have respondents available in our database for practically any kind of study,” said Kamtawijoyo.</p>
<p>Populix is currently developing new products to track market movements, using data collection tech like optical character recognition to scan invoices from major e-commerce platforms. It says its data classification system can recognize over 73% of all items on invoices.</p>

<p>Other companies in the same space include established players like YouGov and Kantar, and Singapore-based Milieu Insight, a market research and data platform that operates in several Southeast Asian countries. Astandu said one of the main ways Populix differentiates is by focusing on mobile surveys, since Indonesia <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266729/smartphone-users-in-indonesia/">is the fourth-largest smartphone market</a> in the world (after China, India and the United States) and the penetration rate is still growing.</p>
<p>The founders said Populix will continue focusing on Indonesia with its pre-Series A funding, but plans to look at other developing markets with fragmented consumer data, like the Philippines and Vietnam, after raising its Series A round.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Intudo Ventures founding partner Patrick Yip said, “With consumer habits undergoing dramatic changes in recent years due to rising incomes and widespread embrace of digital commerce, Populix is providing clients with actionable insights into the latest consumption characteristics and trends of Indonesians. We are excited to double down on our support for Populix as it continues to roll out new technology-driven consumer insights products and solutions to meet the needs of clients both big and small.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies and the reporters who cover them routinely find themselves at odds, particularly when the stories being chased are unflattering or bring unwanted attention to a business&#8217;s dealings, or, in the company&#8217;s estimation, simply inaccurate.</p>
<p>Many companies fight back, which is why crisis communications is a very big and lucrative business. Still, how a company fights back matters. And according to crisis communications pros who TechCrunch spoke with this afternoon, a <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/the-intercepts-latest-2001-04-27/">new post</a> on Oracle&#8217;s corporate blog misses the mark, as did the company&#8217;s related follow-up on social media. <img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2145527 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?w=300" alt="" width="383" height="326" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png 1484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=300,256 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=768,655 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=680,580 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-8.47.46-PM.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, the author of the post, an Oracle executive named Ken Glueck, a 25-year-long veteran of the company, has been <a href="https://gizmodo.com/oracle-vp-ken-glueck-suspended-by-twitter-for-doxing-an-1846783536">temporarily suspended</a> by Twitter after encouraging his followers to harass a female reporter.</p>
<p>The trouble ties to a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://theintercept.com/2021/04/22/oracle-digital-china-resellers-brokers-surveillance/">series</a> of <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/18/oracle-china-police-surveillance/">pieces</a> by the news site The Intercept about how a &#8220;network of local resellers helps funnel Oracle technology to the police and military in China,&#8221; and Oracle&#8217;s response to the pieces.</p>
<p>While it isn&#8217;t uncommon for companies to post responses to media stories on their own platforms (as well as to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-takes-ad-ny-times-address-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal-1097170">take out ads in mainstream media</a> outlets), the crisis execs with whom we spoke &#8212; they asked not to be named as they work with companies like Oracle &#8212; had some observations that might be helpful to Oracle in the future.</p>
<p>Rule number one: don&#8217;t draw attention unnecessarily to work that you might prefer didn&#8217;t exist. Oracle&#8217;s newest post doesn&#8217;t link back to the new Intercept story that Glueck works to dismantle, but in an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/interceptresponse/">earlier post</a> about the first Intercept story that ran in February, Glueck hyperlinks to the story on Oracle&#8217;s blog in the very first sentence of his response, even sharing its intriguing title: &#8220;<a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/18/oracle-china-police-surveillance/">How Oracle Sells Repression in China</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many of Oracle&#8217;s customers or employees saw [The Intercept piece] or didn&#8217;t give a damn, and now he&#8217;s drawing attention to it?&#8221; noted one exec we&#8217;d interviewed today.</p>
<p>Rule number two: Don&#8217;t attack reporters; attack (if you must) the outlet. In Glueck&#8217;s first diatribe against The Intercept over its February piece, he mentions the outlet <a href="https://www.oracle.com/interceptresponse/">26 times</a> and the author of the piece once. In Glueck&#8217;s newest salvo against The Intercept, he refers to its author, reporter Mara Hvistendahl, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/blog/the-intercepts-latest-2001-04-27/">22 times </a>&#8212; mostly by her first name &#8212; and even invites readers of Oracle&#8217;s blog to reach out to him about her, writing in boldface: &#8220;If you have any information about Mara or her reporting, write me securely at kglueck AT protonmail.com.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Glueck has since said the call-out was a tongue-in-cheek gesture, it was subsequently removed from the post, possibly owing to its &#8220;sinister tone&#8221; as observed by one of our experts. &#8220;No one likes a bully,&#8221; said this comms pro, adding that  &#8220;bullying conveys weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rule number three: Know your purpose. By lashing out in what is a plainly derisive tone to The Intercept&#8217;s piece, as well as continuing to <a href="https://twitter.com/KenGlueck/with_replies">doubling down</a> on his attack against Hvistendahl on social media afterward, Glueck&#8217;s strategy became less and less clear, according to one of the crisis specialists we spoke with.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do what Ken did and mock&#8221; the reporter, said this person, &#8220;but is that going to stop The Intercept from continuing to do stories about Oracle? And what is the reaction of other media? Are they scared off by [what happened today] or are they going to circle the wagons?&#8221; (Below: a note from an L.A. Times reporter to Glueck today in response to his call for information about Hvistendahl.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2145492 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png" alt="" width="2342" height="326" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png 2342w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=150,21 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=300,42 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=768,107 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=680,95 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=1536,214 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=2048,285 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-5.48.49-PM.png?resize=50,7 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2342px) 100vw, 2342px" /></p>
<p>Rule four: Keep it short. Two of the pros we spoke with today commended Glueck&#8217;s writing style, calling it both fluid and funny. Both also observed that his response was far too long. &#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t get through it,&#8221; said one.</p>
<p>Last rule: Find another way if possible. The crisis experts we spoke with said it&#8217;s ideal to first work with a reporter, then the reporter&#8217;s editor if necessary, and if it comes to it, involve lawyers, of which Oracle surely has plenty. &#8220;That&#8217;s the chain of appeal if a reporter has gotten a story blatantly wrong,&#8221; said one source.</p>
<p>Very possibly, Glueck decided to throw out this rulebook by design. Oracle tends to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/oracle-is-headed-to-texas-now-too/">do things its own way</a>, and Glueck is very much a product of that culture. Indeed, the WSJ wrote a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/oracles-man-in-washington-fans-the-flames-against-rival-tech-giants-11581615873">1,300-word profile</a> about Glueck last year, calling him a &#8220;potent weapon&#8221; for Oracle.</p>
<p>As for Hvistendahl, she suggests there is another reason Oracle took the route that it did.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to us earlier, she writes that &#8220;Ken Glueck has published two lengthy blog posts attacking me and my editor, Ryan Tate. But Oracle has not refuted my central finding, which is that the company marketed its analytics software for use by police in China. Oracle also hasn’t refuted our reporting on Oracle’s sale and marketing of its analytics software to police elsewhere in the world. We found evidence of Oracle selling or marketing analytics software to police in Mexico, Pakistan, Turkey, and the UAE. In Brazil, my colleague Tatiana Dias uncovered <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/10/policia-rio-tecnologia-oracle-policias-paises-autoritarios/">police contracts </a>between Oracle and Rio de Janeiro’s notoriously corrupt Civil Police.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Indonesia, daily necessities often cost more in smaller cities and rural areas. <a href="https://about.superapp.id/">Super</a> co-founder and chief executive officer Steven Wongsoredjo said the price difference can vary from about 10% to 20% in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, to nearly 200% in eastern provinces. Super uses social commerce and a streamlined logistics chain to lower the cost of goods. The startup announced today it has raised an oversubscribed $28 million Series B led by SoftBank Ventures Asia.</p>
<p>Other participants included returning backers Amasia, Insignia Ventures Partners, Y-Combinator Continuity Fund and Bain Capital co-chairman Stephen Pagliuca, while partners from DST Global and TNB Aura invested for the first time in this round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding brings Super’s total raised so far to more than $36 million, which the company says is the most funding an Indonesian social commerce startup has raised so far.</p>
<p>Super, which took part in Y Combinator&#8217;s winter 2018 batch, focuses mainly on cities or towns with a gross domestic product per capita of $5,000 USD or lower. It currently operates in 17 cities in East Java, and has a network of thousands of agents, or resellers, and hundreds of thousands of end buyers. The company will use its new funding to double its presence in the region and launch in other Indonesian provinces this year. It will also expand its product categories beyond fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and develop its recently-launched white label brand, SuperEats.</p>
<p>Wongsoredjo told TechCrunch that Super’s ultimate goal is to “build the Walmart Group of Indonesia without having a retail store and utilizing the social commerce aspect to build a sustainable model,” similar to the way Pinduoduo became one of China’s biggest e-commerce companies by focusing on smaller cities.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pinduoduo steals Alibaba&#8217;s crown with 788M annual active users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/pinduoduo-surpasses-alibaba/embed/#?secret=tTd0ohP2j3" data-secret="tTd0ohP2j3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prices for consumer goods are higher in small cities and rural areas because of two reasons, Wongsoredjo said. The first is that orders from smaller cities cost more to fulfill, with supply chain costs adding up, than larger orders, and the second is infrastructure that makes it harder for manufacturers and FMCG brands to truck goods into rural areas, so supply does not meet demand.</p>
<p>Super operates a central warehouse, along with smaller hubs closer to buyers. Most of Super’s products are supplied by regional FMCG brands, and group orders are delivered to agents, who in turn perform last-mile deliveries to their buyers. This keeps prices down by making its supply chain more efficient and enabling it to fulfill orders within 24 hours without relying on third-party logistics providers.</p>
<p>Other social commerce companies in Indonesia include KitaBeli, ChiliBeli and Woobiz. Wongsoredjo said Super had a headstart to serve smaller cities and rural areas because it does not focus on Jabodetabek, or the greater Jakarta region. Its headquarters and core operations teams are also all outside of major cities.</p>
<p>“We believe that by not having Jabodetabek’s presence in our DNA, we can build unique social commerce products with the hyperlocal touch to serve rural communities much better,” Wongsoredjo added. “We want to go after the rest of 90% of the market that is still under-penetrated.”</p>
<p>In statement, SoftBank Ventures Asia partner Cindy Jin said, “We have been impressed by the Super team’s deep knowledge and commitment to Indonesia’s underserved regions, and believe that a truly local team like theirs will be well equipped to navigate and build out a platform in this hyperlocal market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that is helping over 125,000 neighborhood stores in India secure working capital, inventory from top brands, and work with e-commerce firms to boost revenues said on Thursday it has raised a new financing round as it looks to further its reach in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Pune-based <a href="https://www.elastic.run">ElasticRun</a> said it has raised $75 million in its Series D financing round co-led by existing investors Avataar Ventures and Prosus Ventures. Existing investor Kalaari Capital also participated in the round, which takes the four-year-old startup’s to-date raise to $130.5 million.</p>
<p>Millions of neighborhood stores that dot large and small cities, towns and villages in India and have proven tough to beat for e-commerce giants and super-chain retailers are at the center of a new play in the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A score of e-commerce companies, offline retail chains and fintech startups are now racing to work with these mom and pop stores as they look to tap a massive untapped opportunity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1905690" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1905690" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1905690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019 10 30 at 2.18.53 PM" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1905690" class="wp-caption-text">Sandeep Deshmukh, co-founder and CEO of ElasticRun, talking about the startup&#8217;s business at a conference in 2019.</p></div></p>
<p>ElasticRun helps merchants operating these stores, who typically have to spend a few days a month visiting bigger cities to secure inventory, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/india-elasticrun-prosus-ventures/">get reliable and more affordable goods</a> directly from big brands. (Big brands love this because this enables them to significantly expand their reach.)</p>
<p>These store owners also spend a number of hours a day not doing much when the business is slow. ElasticRun is also addressing this by partnering with some of the biggest e-commerce firms including Amazon and Flipkart to utilize this workforce to make deliveries to customers. (E-commerce firms find value in this because neighborhood stores have a larger presence in the country, can reach a customer much faster, and also often have their own inventory.)</p>
<p>Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Investments for India at Prosus Ventures, told TechCrunch that ElasticRun has built a variable capacity, crowdsourced delivery model, which distinguishes the startup from other players in the market that have a fixed number of people on payrolls making these deliveries. He said as the startup has developed the railroads, a number of new opportunities has unlocked.</p>
<p>One such opportunity is providing working capital to these neighborhood stores. Their operators typically don’t have savings, and need to sell the existing inventory to secure funds to refill the stock. In recent years, ElasticRun has struck partnerships with banks and NBFCs to provide credit to these merchants.</p>
<p>ElasticRun today operates in over 300 cities in nearly all Indian states. The startup works with over 125,000 neighborhood stores, and plans to expand to reach 1 million in 18 to 24 months, said Shitiz Bansal, co-founder and chief technology officer of ElasticRun, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s current run rate is about $350 million, a figure it plans to grow to over $1 billion in the next 12 months, he said.</p>
<p>Saurabh Nigam, co-founder and chief operating officer, said the new financing round has also enabled the startup to offer early employees access to “tangible benefits” of the firm’s growth over the last five years.</p>

		Mike Murphy is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://rosecliff.com/">Rosecliff Ventures</a>, a New York City-based investment firm focused on venture capital and private equity opportunities.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Consumer technology is an inherently risky investment sector: even the best idea can fall flat if the story of the product is not sold properly to the end user. The stats can only take you so far, and, eventually, customers want to believe in the product.</p>
<p>Traditionally, companies that have successfully told their story and become market leaders have taken the initial public offering route — pitching their story to institutional investors on banker-led roadshows rather than to the people that buy their products.</p>
<p>But the last 18 months have seen a new door open for companies seeking to skip the bankers, partner with good managers, and gain a more direct route to public capital: merging with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the right consumer technology companies — for which the story is often just as, if not more, important than the financial figures — a SPAC deal offers a more direct access to public capital. Instead of walking institutional investors through the P&amp;L, these companies can spend more time telling investors, including the retail investors using the products, what the company can be long-term.</p>
<p>There is no denying the growing popularity of this avenue to public exchanges: more than 200 companies went public via a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/the-2021-outlook-for-the-booming-spac-market-and-traditional-ipos.html">SPAC deal in 2020</a>. But as with any asset that grows hot, there will be parties out there expecting it to blow up.</p>
<p>Lessons have been learned and we probably have more coming, but those who treat SPACs as a sign of the end-days of economic recovery are wrong. These vehicles offer a legitimate route to the public markets while stripping out traditional gatekeepers and allowing individual investors to decide if they want to buy — or sell — a company’s story.</p>
<h2>The SPAC bubble claim</h2>
<p>First, it is important to address the naysayers&#8217; concerns. Given the meteoric rise in SPAC activity, analysts speculate that the trend is overblown; they argue that companies are listing too early and that money losers are getting access to public capital before they deserve it.</p>
<p>But when is it “too early” to enter the public market? DraftKings, one of the most successful SPAC stories of 2020, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/latest-spac%3A-insight-into-draftkings-listing-2020-04-27">went public</a> about eight years after it was founded, and Facebook was private for a similar length of time before its IPO. Meanwhile, Apple, <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-worlds-most-profitable-company-233757903.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN4yyWFIF628gfIW-cxcuDeoSxhT88_zBYI3VvExr_wTe-GTXbl6szWaeinFcxfg_mse3BSxNXTMFaupvhjzFA95brRGDeQeJ3QB91477BpUlA-32Sug1rvySBPN8d5WFvXSR4eqPcSHdfdIhQ_tvHL_kUS8z-LqeOazOsXY8aet">the most profitable company in the world</a>, listed less than four years after its founding. Tenure may be a factor in investors’ minds, but lack thereof has never stopped a company from listing on the public markets.</p>
<p>Profitability has also rarely been a requirement for an IPO. Uber, Tesla, and Amazon are all prime examples of unprofitable businesses that listed while reporting losses.</p>
<p>In all these examples, clear, coherent visions, strong leadership teams, and patience from investors to see leaders execute on their vision overcame the traditional financial barometers of success.</p>
<h2>The market knows how to value a story</h2>
<p>The public markets are obsessed with quarterly results. A company can miss analysts’ expectations for earnings per share by just a cent and its stock will be sent tumbling. However, not all companies are assessed this way: Many companies are valued on their vision for the future and their progress towards their goals. SPACs are an effective way to invest in a strong team or vision even when there’s not enough financial data to back a traditional investment.</p>
<p>Biotech firms are an excellent and timely example of the way investors are looking at the market, especially post-pandemic. Biotechs usually describe a treatment they are developing and the patients it could help; they provide estimates of the addressable market, the price they could charge, and the timeline they could expect to get through clinical trials. However, an early-phase biotech could be years away from selling any drugs, let alone turning a profit. The FDA estimates the time to complete Phase II and Phase III trials, the final phases before applying for approval, can total <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research#Clinical_Research_Phase_Studies">up to six years</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, investors <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research#Clinical_Research_Phase_Studies">pour money into these companies</a>. Analysts estimate the likelihood of a drug advancing in its trials after detailed scrutiny, but these companies can see their stocks rise for years while losing money. The markets will expect high returns for taking these risks, but they can arrive at a price nonetheless.</p>

<h2>The storytellers of consumer tech</h2>
<p>The SPAC route is a match made in heaven for consumer tech companies: SPACs put more of a focus on the management team and the vision than traditional IPOs, which is a boon for the sector, as this industry has always been dominated by visionaries.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the savviest investors in SPACs will be paying close attention to direct-to-consumer technology, but not in the traditional, limited sense of D2C.</p>
<p>Consumers are looking for goods and services that they can access more quickly and reliably than ever before. Conveniently, the companies that tend to succeed in ramping up these options through technology are natural storytellers that know how to bring their product directly to the end-user. Inevitably, these firms are going to be on the radar of SPAC investors.</p>
<p>For example, fintech, in many ways, has become direct-to-consumer because it offers customers banking features directly on their phones. In just the last year, innovation in telemedicine has brought most health appointments from the waiting room to the living room, and forced outdated healthcare administration practices to embrace digital systems.</p>
<p>Products you could only buy at physical stores, like mattresses, can now be delivered straight to your door with companies like Casper and Purple. Certain auto companies will allow you to even design and buy a car as easily as ordering a pizza.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this trend by exposing the need for faster, tech-driven access to services, and our “return to normal” means this trend is only going upwards. SPACs will be around to bring these ideas to market faster and provide the capital these companies need to meet the demand.</p>
<h2>The road ahead<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the speculation, naysaying and “bubble” talk, SPACs have been around for decades and aren’t going to disappear in a flash. Indeed, the pace of SPAC deals might cool down and carry a higher risk premium as the trend continues, but just like the changes in consumer technology, SPACs themselves will evolve to best serve their consumers.</p>
<p>In many ways, the SPAC model is very similar to the way consumer technology has developed: It encourages disruption of established constructs. What&#8217;s more, investors in pre-acquisition SPACs get access to venture-like opportunities without the capital traditionally required for such investments.</p>
<p>In the end, a company&#8217;s success will depend on it meeting or exceeding targets, or if something pulls demand forward. The rules have not changed, and neither has the risk or the reward.</p>
