										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Flagship Pioneering, the major investor behind Moderna, announced yet another addition to their portfolio of RNA-curious companies. Following a year of hype around mRNA, a new company, called Alltrna, will now focus on developing medicines based on Transfer RNA or tRNA.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you’re likely familiar with the idea that messenger RNA (mRNA, the stuff used in Moderna and Pfizer’s COVID vaccines), is a set of genetic blueprints that tells the cell to assemble certain amino acids, and join them together into proteins. Think of tRNA as a n L-shaped molecule that does </span><a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Transfer-RNA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the actual work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of assembling the amino acids called for in the mRNA blueprint. Transfer RNAs perform one of the final steps our cells use to take genetic code and turn it into a functional protein in the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna’s thesis is that one tRNA could be used to treat “thousands of diseases</span><b>,” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">as </span><a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/people/lovisa-afzelius"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lovisa Afzelius</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an origination partner at Flagship and co-founder of Alltrna told TechCrunch. The company has been in proto-mode for the past three years, where its team of 30 people has been developing a “platform” for tRNA therapeutic development. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230055" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a really critical molecule,” said Afzelius. “Yet it has been, until now, completely overlooked as a modality. What we have developed is a broad tRNA platform that allows us to explore the totality of tRNA biology.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderna and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines have proved to be a pretty convincing demonstration of what mRNA technology can do. But this has also been a big year for funding for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">alternative RNA projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Flagship unveiled Laronde, a company aiming to develop 100 different endless RNA (eRNA) products and drug programs </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/flagship-pioneering-unveils-laronde-to-advance-endless-rna---a-new-class-of-programmable-medicines-capable-of-expressing-therapeutic-proteins-inside-the-body-301287088.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the next decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. eRNA is a type of RNA developed specifically by Flagship, and is designed to prolong the therapeutic effects of certain medicines, or create “persistent” expression of therapeutic proteins in the body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laronde </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/laronde-attracts-440m-in-first-external-financing-to-further-advance-endless-rna-platform-301364820.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">went on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to raise about $440 in Series B funding this year, with investment from Flagship, as well as funds and accounts managed by T. Rowe Price, CPP investments, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds, and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of tRNA-based medicine is still relatively new, but it is starting to attract more attention. Three startups, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ReCode Therapeutics, Shape Therapeutics, and Tevard Biosciences, have all collectively raised $240 million to develop tRNA-based therapeutics, </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/tRNA-therapies-help-restore-proteins/99/i34"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C&amp;EN reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna’s big sell on tRNA is its potential to intervene in a huge variety of diseases. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/people/theonie-anastassiadis">Theonie Anastassiadis</a>, a principal at Flagship, and co-founder and chief innovation officer of Alltrna argues tRNAs have the ability to control “many aspects of translation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, certain pools of “proliferation tRNAs” are involved in cell division (and some studies have suggested that </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781600/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">down regulating certain tRNAs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be one way to slow cell proliferation in response to cancer). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">tRNAs can also correct issues arising from erroneous genetic code. Some genes may contain mutations that act as premature “stop” signs (called stop codons). These stop signs tell the body to stop making certain proteins, </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/stop-codon#:~:text=Premature%20stop%20codons%20are%20those,as%20truncated)%20protein%20is%20formed."><span style="font-weight: 400;">even if the protein isn’t complete</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leading to complications. Premature stop codons are a big player in genetic disease, and could be implicated in anywhere from </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/tRNA-therapies-help-restore-proteins/99/i34"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 percent </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6183/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-third</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to  of all inherited genetic disorders or cancers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind engineering tRNAs, says Afzelius, is that they might read those stop signs anyway, but assemble complete proteins anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These actual stop codons can be the same across thousands of diseases. There is the same amino acid that needs to be resorted in all those proteins. We can actually use that same tRNA medicine across that broad range of genetic diseases,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alltrna’s approach to tRNA begins by expanding the tools needed to actually do tRNA based medicine development. Basic methodologies for expressing tRNAs, measuring their levels, modifying them and synthesizing them are currently “extremely technically challenging” says Anastassiadis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing we did as part of the platform was actually build these tools that are not proprietary to Alltrna,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of this platform for tRNA therapeutics is about as specific as the company will get about its plans. So far, the company has not disclosed any partnerships, nor are they disclosing specific diseases they’re currently working on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Flagship has committed $50 million to the Alltrna – the same amount it initially supplied to LaRonde this year. In the future, Afzelius says the company will plan to pursue outside investment &#8220;when the time is right.&#8221; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Great Resignation, the pandemic-caused seismic shift in the way we work, play and live, and the boom of the creator and influencer economy has led to a surge in apps designed to serve those creators. In fact, we had a <em>very</em> long-winded discussion about it at TechCrunch just this week.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know which apps are going to change the game and which are going to sink, but Emergence is betting big on a platform called <a href="https://www.thetalenthack.com/home">Talent Hack</a>.</p>
<p>The company is today announcing a $17 million Series A financing round, led by Emergence, with participation from existing investor Global Founders Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231179" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup was founded by Alexandra Bonetti, making Talent Hack the first Latina female-led startup in the Emergence portfolio.</p>
<p>Before Talent Hack, fitness creators were stitching together a handful of platforms to run their business, from Paypal to Wix to email automation software, and more. Or, they were working for a studio or a big box gym without the freedom and flexibility to set their own course.</p>
<p>Talent Hack provides software that streamlines all of that, complete with payment processing, website design and publishing, scheduling software, email automation, and CRM.</p>
<p>This allows fitness creators to focus on their clients and their classes, rather than dealing with running their business via software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Talent Hack says that creators that switch over to Talent Hack increase their revenue by an average of 280 percent.</p>
<p>One differentiator between Talent Hack and some of its competitors is that it doesn&#8217;t aggregate fitness creators on behalf of the customer, but rather focuses on letting the creator build out their audience with the tools they need to be successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a model that doesn&#8217;t attack the creators&#8217; relationship with their clients,&#8221; said Bonetti. &#8220;We&#8217;re not building a marketplace or shopping talent around to other clients. We really protect them and our client philosophy is we never get in the way of the client/talent relationship. We really go out of our way to build that out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Talent Hack makes money by charging a processing fee for sessions booked through the platform, which is paid for by the client and not the creator. This fee ranges anywhere from three to 10 percent, and is algorithmically based on geography, spending patterns, and attendance at their classes, among other factors.</p>
<p>The startup also provides educational tools and courses to creators who are looking to grow their business. The new funding will be used to expand this program, and will also be used to build out Talent Hack Co-Spaces, which will give creators the ability to train in one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge we have is a very exciting market with a lot of capital, a lot of investment, both horizontally and within our vertical,&#8221; said Bonetti. &#8220;And this is a very fragmented industry and that&#8217;s the value in bringing these creators in one place. Once once we&#8217;re able to really do that, there is so much to build to serve them. But like any industry that&#8217;s starting to aggregate for the first time, that&#8217;s a hard challenge.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Good Glamm Group, the parent firm of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/amazon-backed-indian-d2c-beauty-brand-myglamm-raises-71-million/"> direct-to-consumer beauty brand MyGlamm,</a> is the latest Indian startup to join the unicorn club.</p>
<p>The Mumbai-headquartered startup has raised $150 million in its Series D financing round from Prosus Ventures and Warburg Pincus among others. The new round, which also saw participation from Alteria Capital and existing investors L’Occitane, Bessemer Venture Partners, Amazon, Ascent Capital and the Mankekar Family Office, values the four-year-old startup at $1.2 billion post-money.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a 12x surge in its valuation from $100 million in March this year and $300 million in July.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231183" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>MyGlamm’s parent firm operates as a house of brands in the beauty and personal care spaces. It sells the vast majority of its products from its own website, app and retail touch points.</p>
<p>The firm is one of the earliest startups in India that has demonstrated success with blending content and commerce to drive sales. Its content offering, alongside an army of over 220,000 influencers, helps customers spot new products and spur engagement.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement comes at a time when MyGlamm has aggressively acquired a number of brands to broaden its offerings. In an interview with TechCrunch, MyGlamm co-founder and chief executive Darpan Sanghvi said the startup has spent about $270 million in equity and cash to buy a number of firms that fit with the startup&#8217;s vision.</p>
<p>MyGlamm, which last month acquired direct-to-consumer (D2C) mother and baby care brand The Moms Co for over $65 million, is finalizing talks to acquire another four brands that it expects to close by the end of this year, said Sanghvi.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The inorganic push to expand MyGlamm has proven successful for the firm, which last year acquired POPxo, a startup that has built a community around content, influencers and commerce. POPxo &#8212; founded by Priyanka Gill, who joined MyGlamm as part of the acquisition &#8212; has supercharged the larger firm&#8217;s commerce in the past one year. POPxo&#8217;s userbase, in the meantime, has ballooned to 88 million users, up from 60 million in July, said Gill in an interview.</p>

<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement is a major turnaround for Sanghvi, who started MyGlamm in 2017 after pivoting his previous venture. In an earlier interview, he recalled the struggle he faced raising money for a direct-to-consumer brand, which were not as popular in the world’s second-largest internet market just five years ago. To make matters worse, MyGlamm was also among the last direct-to-consumer startups to kick off its journeys at the time.</p>
<p>Four years is a long time in the startup world. Darpan said Tuesday that for years South Korea and Japan have produced large and iconic D2C brands. It&#8217;s now time India joins that club and sets new charts, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very excited to partner with the Good Glamm Group to disrupt the beauty and personal care industry and this marks our first investment in the DTC category. The Good Glamm team has paired desirable, homegrown brands with compelling content, building an incredibly engaged community and positioning them well for future growth in India and beyond,&#8221; said Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Investments India at Prosus Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>Naiyya Saggi, co-founder of MyGlamm, said the startup has already achieved EBIDTA break-even and the new capital will serve as a war chest as it scales. By the second half of next year, MyGlamm plans to begin its international expansion, she said in an interview. In about two and a half years, Good Glamm Group also plans to file for an IPO.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio-based startup <a href="https://mantiumai.com/">Mantium</a> has today announced closing $12.75 million in seed funding, as well as the launch of a cloud-based AI platform &#8212; which allows users to build with large language models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed round, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-led by venture funds Drive Capital and Top Harvest, will be used to source for more talent, to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">add more features to Mantium’s AI platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in driving awareness around what is achievable with large language models, especially across Africa,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the firm&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Ryan Sevey told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is looking to expand its team of 33, which is currently spread across nine countries, including Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. Having a globally distributed team, Sevey said, helps in the generation of unique insights and varying problem-solving approaches around AI.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230847" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ll also continue with more activities within Africa. This (AI) is an evolving topic, and we will get more advanced with the talks, but right now, it&#8217;s mostly an introduction to what is capable with large language models.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mantium’s AI platform, which starting today has moved from its beta version to general availability, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enables both technical and non-technical persons to build applications using resources of providers that include OpenAI, EleutherAI, AI21 and Cohere,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and soon to be added, Hugging Face. Together with the platform’s comprehensive documentation and API integrations, with the compatible platforms like OpenAI, users are able to mix and match capabilities on Mantium without requiring expertise in each platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of the cloud-based platform is designed to make it easy and possible for users to publish live prototype applications with the click of two buttons, a capability that does not require a user to have prior coding experience. It has also integrated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">logging and automated filtering, ensuring that users remain compliant with safety and security requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is massive potential for innovation with AI, but we need to make it easier and faster for developers and creatives to get to deployment,” said Sevey.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Mantium, we are making it possible not only for anyone to use large language models and AI to build something, but to get to prototype faster, and share it with their communities, all while maintaining the most stringent safety and security measures,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sevey got to finally build Mantium in January this year, after he attended an OpenAI beta program where most of the participants, who were from non-technical fields, were using OpenAI resources to build products but could not share with friends or launch. The attendees&#8217; pain points inspired him to create a product that makes it easy for people to build with AI and deploy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, he added, is the realization of his long-term dream of democratizing AI in a meaningful way &#8212; something he has wanted to do throughout involvement with machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“About 80% (of the attendees to the OpenAI program) were not technical. They had no prior coding, knowledge or experience. And they were building these really cool things. These would be things like maybe a poem generator, or some people were doing really interesting stuff with music and helping them write lyrics, all kinds of more creative focused stuff,” said Sevey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI can be used to execute various actions, including helping users generate music by parsing terabytes of data from millions of songs. It can also be used in business to do classification on text to figure out the intent, can be deployed to extract information from patient medical records and to generate synthetic data.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They had no idea how to actually share that with the rest of the world. So, we created Mantium. And one of the features that&#8217;s within Mantium is what we call one-click deploy, which essentially means that once you have your AI creation, you click two buttons and it&#8217;s live. So, you get a URL, it spins up a web application and you can interact with your creation, which you can share with your friends,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such features, he said, push the boundaries of what is possible with AI, while hastening the pace of new developments &#8212; from proof of concept to production &#8212; by eliminating barriers. This in turn ensures that users or developers have more time to fine tune and build better models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And that is a big burden lifted off, quite frankly, everyone including the technical people, who don&#8217;t want to spend hours or days to set up something like Heroku or Digital Ocean or whatever the case might be, just to share a prototype out there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to see the next wave of technological breakthroughs come from artists and creatives who, with the power of Mantium, can now play and build with AI.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sevey says the company is currently focused on improving its user experience with plans to make it a consumption-based business later on. However, he noted that Mantium will always have a free version “that lets people get started and lets them get their prototype out there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have client libraries (Python and JavaScript) right now. And that is certainly being used again primarily by the more technical people, but I would say the majority of the community is right &#8212; it&#8217;s about 70% creatives and the rest are more technical.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sevey said Mantium is also preparing to enter a phase where it will create impactful meaning applications beginning next year &#8212; as it moves to connect “things with AI”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So by quarter one of next year, we will have a lot more integrations with our platform so that it becomes even more of a single pane of glass so that you have your large language model, it&#8217;s generating something, or it&#8217;s classifying something and then it connects to your chatbot or to your internal accounting system,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And as we think about the future, I think this notion of connecting things with AI becomes increasingly important.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apps that let people do virtually what they would have previously had to carry out in person have seen a boom in the last 20 months of pandemic living, and one of them today is announcing a big fundraise on the back of its own strong growth. <a href="https://jackpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackpocket</a>, which currently has 2.5 million active users who use its app to buy tickets to play lotteries in 10 U.S. states, has picked up $120 million in a Series D round, funding that CEO and founder Peter Sullivan said it plans to use to expand from its core business of lottery ticket sales into a wider array of mobile gaming, and to take its business to more markets both in the U.S. and further afield, both on its own and in partnership with others.</p>
<p class="p10">&#8220;We expect by the end of Q1 to be in at least five other states,&#8221; Sullivan said, adding that technology investments are also on the to-do list, by bringing in more &#8220;best practices&#8221; from the worlds of e-commerce, subscriptions and mobile wallet services, alongside exploring other forms of gaming.</p>
<p class="p10">&#8220;What a lot of people<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> don’t know about the lottery is that a percentage goes to good causes,&#8221; he said. New areas that Jackpocket wants explore include raffles, sweepstakes, bingo, social casino games. &#8220;We want to provide more fun game play and chances to win, and more ways to give back.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is what Jackpocket&#8217;s expansion strategy looks like according to its most recent pitch deck:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2231186" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="376" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png 2376w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=1536,849 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=2048,1133 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-6.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Left Lane Capital is leading the investment, with comedian Kevin Hart, Whitney Cummings, Mark Cuban and Manny Machado, among the individuals participating, alongside previous backers Greenspring Associates, The Raine Group, Anchor Capital, Gaingels, Conductive Ventures and Blue Run Ventures; and new backer Santa Barbara Venture Partners. (Jackpocket was founded in New York but also has an operation out of Santa Barbara, CA; that&#8217;s where CEO and founder Peter Sullivan is based and was speaking from when I interviewed him for this story.)</p>
<p>Sullivan said the company would not be disclosing its valuation with this round, which brings the total raised by the company to just under $200 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For some more context: Jackpocket last raised money only in February of this year, a $50 million Series C round, when it was valued at $160 million post-money, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/63994-60/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. But it has grown since then: its current 2.5 million active user figure is up 300% in the last eight months.</p>
<p>Sullivan said that the idea for Jackpocket came to him in part because of his father, who was, in his words, &#8220;a blue collar guy born in Brooklyn who played the state lottery in New York, but was computer illiterate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The year was 2012, and one of the big themes in the world of tech at the time was the rise of apps that were bringing previously-offline services into the digital world; another big theme was the surge of interest in mobile gaming. Putting those trends together, Sullivan saw an opportunity to build an app to order lottery tickets &#8212; something that typically required people to go into convenience stores that could be done instead from the phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We positioned ourselves as the Uber or Instacart for lottery,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jackpocket is part lottery ticket storefront, but also part virtualizer of the whole lottery experience. As Sullivan described it to me, people use the mobile app to order lottery tickets. At the back end, Jackpocket is doing the actual buying in advance, using proprietary software that it built to take &#8220;scans&#8221; of each ticket that the player buys. Players can see the ticket, which is watermarked by Jackpocket to keep it unique and authentic.</p>
<p>As with all kinds of other real-money online gaming, Jackpocket is built with various levers so that it complies with different regulations around age, geographical location (you have to be a resident of the state where you are playing). This includes using GPS technology to identify users&#8217; locations, but also checks to determine whether people are using VPNs, or are tied to computers via other applications. Players also need to upload identification to verify themselves and their ages.</p>
<p>The company has also made a play for being a more &#8220;responsible&#8221; player in the gambling world. It monitors user spending and doesn&#8217;t let anyone spend more than $100 per day, or whatever limit under that amount they choose to set.</p>
<p class="p10">Its business model is based on taking a 9% cut on any transactions it makes itself. That means, if you put money into the app to buy tickets, you&#8217;re charged 9%, but if you use your winnings to play, you do not. Nor are you charged to withdraw money.</p>
<p>All the same, and even with a clear market opportunity (its biggest competition at the time was the fragmented convenience store market) the startup found it very hard initially to raise money.</p>
<p class="p10">&#8220;It was considered taboo to do real money gaming at the time,&#8221; Sullivan said of his experience of knocking on doors in Sand Hill Road in the early days, one reason why the company raised relatively little (around $25 million) before this year&#8217;s Series C. &#8220;Nine years ago investors wouldn’t talk to us, but I knew lottery would hbe the key here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is the largest amount of real money gaming, largest net and lightest touch point and it works well cross-selling it to other formats.&#8221;</p>
<p>The investment tide really started to turn on the back of the success of companies like FanDuel and other real-money gaming has changed the tune for lottery, and Jackpocket, too. The company cites figures from industry group North American State and Provincial Lotteries that estimate that the total annual spend from consumers on lotteries is <a href="https://naspl.org/nasplmembers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$85.6 billion</a>. This is more than the combined spend in several other leisure categories: print and digital books (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/422595/print-book-sales-usa/#:~:text=Book%20sales%20statistics%202018&amp;text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20trade,in%20the%20same%20time%20span" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.8 billion</a>), movie tickets (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/2018-box-office-revenue-soars-record-119m-us-hits-42b-globally-1172215/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$11.9 billion</a>), video games (<a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-10-countries-by-game-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$31.5 billion</a>), concert tickets (<a href="https://bestclassicbands.com/2018-top-concert-tours-12-17-18/#:~:text=2018%20was%20a%20record%2Dsetting,covers%20the%20worldwide%20concert%20industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$10.4 billion</a>) and sporting events (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/194224/sports-gate-revenue-in-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$17.7 billion</a>).</p>
<p class="p10">&#8220;I saw my dad buy these tickets, but I never knew how big it was,&#8221; Sullivan said. And that&#8217;s not considering also the changing demographics of lottery ticket buyers, where some 70% of buyers are under the age of 45 years old. &#8220;It&#8217;s a more tech-savvy and affluent buyer,&#8221; Sullivan said, which also plays well into an app-based experience.</p>
<p class="p10">The past two years&#8217; particular set of circumstances, meanwhile, has also given a big fillip to companies like Jackpocket, with the consumers who would have previously visited their corner shops to buy items like lottery tickets spending more time at home to socially distance and avoid the spread of Covid-19, and many of those small stores that remained open switching to delivery services, or making it generally less easy to pop in to buy tickets.</p>
<p class="p6">The &#8220;cross-selling&#8221; other formats, as Sullivan describes it, will be an important area to watch. It could be about selling other kinds of lottery-style experiences, but also potentially partnering with the companies like, say instant grocery delivery startups, which are the digital extensions of the convenience stores that have been lottery&#8217;s retail bread and butter up to now, or other gaming companies. That potential is one reason to raise so much right now.</p>
<p class="p6">“Mobile gaming and lottery is experiencing an exciting and unprecedented level of growth and expansion.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At Left Lane, it’s clear to us that Jackpocket is spearheading this progress and innovating at a pace never seen before in this industry,” said Harley Miller, founder and managing partner of Left Lane Capital, in a statement. “We were invigorated by the opportunity to take part in this historic moment and look forward to supporting Jackpocket’s role in this landscape.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A good thing about technology products is that they can make a particular type of service cheaper over time. We&#8217;re seeing the phenomenon play out in the corporate spend market.</p>
<p>This morning <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a>, one of the North American startups competing in the corporate card and expense software space, announced that it will offer a free tier of its service, and that it will return most of its transaction revenues to customers via a new set of cash-back rates on its pre-funded and charge cards.</p>
<p>Airbase users that use pre-funded Airbase cards at their company will receive 2.25% cash back, while those using charge cards will receive 1.75%, the difference due to the capital cost of offering credit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231145" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>The corporate spend market has grown quickly, leading to ample venture capital and customer interest.</p>
<p>Broadly, there have been two models in play: Free services, and those that charge. Ramp, Divvy and Brex historically offered their services for free, making money instead via interchange, or transaction revenues. Airbase took a different tack, charging for its expense and spend management software, making it more like a traditional SaaS company.</p>
<p>Over time, the two models have blurred, with Brex offering paid software and, starting today, Airbase offering a free version of its product for smaller customers. Airbase&#8217;s aggressive posture is notable for its now offering a no-cost version of its software and opening its veins by giving even free customers its interchange incomes as cash back. The company is effectively repricing free corporate spend products lower by not keeping a good-sized chunk of interchange revenues for itself.</p>
<p>More simply, Airbase is working to eliminate the margin its competitors earn by giving it back to customers, betting that its customers&#8217; graduation rate from its free service to its paid tier will make up for what it is giving away.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This could put Ramp and Brex in a modest pickle — their cost advantage is under attack by a historically more expensive competitor that is now offering its free customers all the interchange revenue that the competing two startups have long lived off.</p>
<p>The Amazon riff about margins and opportunities comes to mind here.</p>
<p>Not that TechCrunch expects Ramp or Brex to take this Airbase move lying down. They will not. Each has oceans of capital as well as venture backers that have shown a sharp willingness to provide them with more financial firepower. But it matters that Airbase is scorched-earthing interchange revenues by giving the money back to end-users. It makes it cheaper — to the point of negative cost — to use modern corporate spend services. That should help with customer acquisition.</p>
<p>TechCrunch chatted with Airbase CEO Thejo Kote about the product news, curious how much marketing effort his company was going to put into its new, free product, called Essentials. Kote said that there is a big push coming, implying that Airbase doesn&#8217;t merely want to attract a few smaller companies to its free product to later convert. It wants to get lots of them, and that, naturally, will bring it into closer competition with Ramp and Brex, which have historically focused on smaller companies.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to the corporate spend market than just business model dynamics and fundraising. Airbase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/airbase-adds-spend-support-for-international-subsidiaries/">expanded support</a> for international corporate subsidiaries this September, for example, and the results of that product work will be found in customer up-sell rates from free to paid versions of the company&#8217;s software, which it reckons can take a company from inception to an eventual IPO.</p>
<p>But with three American corporate spend startups bashing one another over the head with capital — Airbase<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/airbase-raises-60m-as-the-corporate-spend-market-segments-matures/"> raised $60 million in a round led by Menlo</a> rather recently, Brex is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/brex-raises-300m-at-a-12-3b-valuation/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">raising $300 million more at a $12.3 billion valuation</a>, and Ramp <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/ramp-financial-series-c--d4f66d47">raised $300 million just a few months ago</a> — it&#8217;s fun to see where they are finding market space to undercut one another, to the benefit of customers who keep getting more for less.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how Brex and Ramp respond, and if Airbase actually does manage to preclude interchange fees as a spend software monetization technique by simply deciding to give them back to users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blockrenovation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block Renovation</a> wants to be a part of every home renovation in America after raising $50 million in Series C funding led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The New York-based company is carving out its piece of the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/home-remodeling-is-a-450-billion-market-and-its-only-going-to-get-bigger-2019-03-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$450 billion U.S. home renovation market</a> with its homeowner and contractor tool to digitize and simplify the home renovation experience, which is definitely an experience if you’ve ever tried even the simplest of changes to your home.</p>
<p>Block Renovation co-founder Koda Wang told TechCrunch that <a href="https://money.com/millennials-shaping-housing-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half of all homebuyers are now under the age of 36</a> and that 87% of them hire a professional for their renovation versus trying to tackle some of the projects themselves.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230935" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The current status of home renovation is abysmal,” he added. “Homeowners hire two guys and a van and pray because they don’t know what the project will look like, how much it will cost or how long it will take.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wall Street needs to relax, as startups show remote work is here to stay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/wall-street-needs-to-relax-because-remote-work-is-here-to-stay/embed/#?secret=RsxUv6OHPc" data-secret="RsxUv6OHPc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After studying the contractor side, the company found it wasn’t much better: Most contractors enjoy the work they are doing, but also have to be small business owners, which means knowing how to do sales, marketing, billing and procurement, which they have to start from scratch with each project, Wang said.</p>
<p>As people’s expectations for consumer experiences are higher than before, Block Renovation “productizes” home renovation by packaging everything together for both the homeowner and contractor, then providing a way for the contractor and homeowner to communicate with each other at every step of the project. The contractor can even take photos of each step of the project and provide a progress update so the homeowner can see how it is going.</p>
<p>In addition, homeowners don’t often have the data of how much it costs for renovation, especially if they decide to move something like a light, or add a wall, Wang said.</p>
<p>“We’ve taken that on for them by accumulating data points and giving them an estimate within 5% to 10% accuracy,” he added.</p>
<p>Joining SoftBank in the round are existing investors Giant Ventures, NEA, Morningside and Lerer Hippeau. Other investors in the round included Obvious Ventures, Rainfall Ventures, Firstminute Capital, BoxGroup, SV Angel and a group of individual investors, including interior designer Kelly Wearstler, designer Ann Sacks, Opendoor co-founder and CEO Eric Wu, Angi CEO Oisin Hanrahan and Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest investment gives the company a total of $104 million in venture funding since the company was founded by Wang and Luke Sherwin in 2018.</p>
<p>Things are moving fast for Block Renovation, with the company “doubling and tripling” its growth metrics over the past year, Wang said. The latest round comes just four months after the company announced a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/block-renovation-secures-40-million-140000761.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 million Series B round</a>, led by Giant Ventures, added Los Angeles to its list of markets and rolled out its kitchen remodeling feature — it started with bathrooms — as well as ​​free software, services and data for contractors.</p>
<p>Wang said the Series C round was not something the company had actively sought out, but the company was eager to work with Lydia Jett, partner at SoftBank Investment Advisors, who had previously invested in Coupang and Flipkart, and whom Forbes described as having the “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/15/rose-park-softbank-big-winners-in-coupang-ipo/?sh=1ac125c64e24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest cash-returning position for a woman startup investor</a>.”</p>
<p>“The rise of working from home has sparked an increased interest in home improvement projects but many customers are put off by the complexity and cost. “Jett said in a written statement. “Block Renovation is reimagining this process with a simplified and transparent digital platform that spans from planning to build. We are delighted to be partnering with Koda and Luke to support them in making home renovations more predictable and accessible.”</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Lyft and Motional, the Aptiv-Hyundai joint venture aimed at commercializing autonomous driving technology, have announced plans to launch their first fully driverless ride-hail service in Las Vegas in 2023. The news follows multiple years of collaboration, both between the two companies and within the City of Sin.</p>
<p>By the second half of next year, Motional and Lyft aim to be transporting public passengers, who will be able to book rides through the Lyft app, in Motional&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/hyundai-ioniq-5-will-be-motional-and-lyfts-first-robotaxi/">electric Hyundai IONIQ 5-based robotaxis</a> before scaling up to a full commercial launch where Lyft is allowed to charge for rides in 2023.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising to see Motional and Lyft choose Las Vegas as the first city in which to launch a driverless service, but it is a major milestone for the companies as they work towards their shared goal of commercializing autonomous ride-hail. The two have had a relationship with each other  since 2018, when Lyft and Aptiv launched a one-week program in Las Vegas to test a robotaxi service during CES. In November last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/motional-gets-approval-to-test-fully-driverless-vehicles-in-las-vegas/">Nevada gave Motional approval to test its autonomous vehicles</a> without a human safety driver, and just two months ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/motional-expands-operations-in-las-vegas-ahead-of-2023-robotaxi-launch/">Motional announced it would expand its operations and employee headcount in Las Vegas</a> and triple the size of its testing facility.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230971" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In other words, all signs had been pointing to Tuesday&#8217;s announcement for some time. Now, the industry will be keeping an eye out for expansion into more cities. Motional had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/">previously targeted 2023 for commercial launch in major U.S. cities,</a> and this summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/">it announced plans to expand its presence in California</a> with a new Los Angeles operations facility that would support testing on public roads.</p>
<p>Motional isn&#8217;t sharing the exact number of vehicles it will launch with Lyft in Las Vegas at this time, and said it would share additional details on the operational design domain, which would stipulate the conditions under which Motional&#8217;s AVs could safely operate, closer to launch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beauty of the agreement with Lyft is that it has the potential to scale widely – we could reach millions of Lyft riders,&#8221; a spokesperson for Motional told TechCrunch, also noting that the company would share more information about plans to launch in other cities &#8220;in the future.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>The initial phase of non-commercial driverless deployment, which will begin in 2022, will allow the companies to fine-tune their autonomous offering by collecting rider feedback and improving upon user experience ahead of commercial launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Other autonomous vehicle companies are getting close to launching commercial driverless operations, as well. Just last week, self-driving GM subsidiary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/cruise-launches-driverless-robotaxi-service-for-employees-in-san-francisco/">Cruise launched a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco</a> for employees and certain members of the public. The company also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/gm-backed-cruise-seeks-final-approval-for-robotaxis-in-san-francisco.html">applied for a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission</a> for final approval to charge for ride-hail services. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/cruise-lays-out-its-plan-for-how-it-will-make-robotaxis-a-reality/">Cruise has big plans for scaling up its operations</a>, which are all vertically integrated, to the point of having thousands of purpose-built Origin AVs on the road over the next few years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launch services provider <a href="https://spaceflight.com/">Spaceflight Inc.</a> said Tuesday it will deploy customer spacecraft to two distinct orbits for the first time, as the company seeks to expand the capabilities of its Sherpa line of orbital transfer vehicles.</p>
<p>Orbital transfer vehicles (OTV) have become a popular way for satellites to reach their final destinations in orbit, allowing smaller space companies to forego the cost and mass of having their own propulsion system while also splitting the cost of an OTV – similar to how SpaceX lets companies split the cost of launch under its rideshare mission program.</p>
<p>Seattle-based Spaceflight aims to execute the maneuver using a new type of Sherpa space tug outfitted with a chemical propulsion system. It is calling the new vehicle the Sherpa-LTC1, and it marks the third type of Sherpa OTV that the company has debuted in the last twelve months. Spaceflight also developed a Sherpa tug equipped with an electric propulsion system, which it calls the Sherpa-LTE, that flew on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/spacex-delivers-88-satellites-to-orbit-lands-first-stage-onshore-for-first-time-in-2021/">SpaceX Transporter-2</a> mission in June, and a Sherpa-LT it debuted in 2020.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sherpa-LTC1 will head to space next year, aboard the SpaceX Transporter-3 launch that’s scheduled to depart from Florida’s Cape Canaveral in January. The space tug will put a collective 13 customer spacecraft into two separate orbits. First, the Sherpa OTV will deploy nine smallsat payloads before maneuvering to a lower altitude to deploy the remaining four cubesats.</p>
<p>Customers for the mission include Capella Space, Umbra Space, Lynk Global, Inc., Kleos Space, NASA, Czech Aerospace Research Centre in partnership with Spacemanic, Space Products and Innovation (SPiN), and Portland State Aerospace Society.</p>
<p>The new space tug uses a “green” propulsion system developed by Benchmark Space Systems, which the company says will enable rapid orbital transfer for many different sized spacecrafts. According to Grant Bonin, SVP of business development at Spaceflight, &#8220;maneuvers in LEO are just the beginning. These capabilities and services will play a crucial role in accessing other orbits beyond LEO and developing in-space transportation and various mission services.&#8221;</p>
<p>In September, Spaceflight announced it would debut yet another Sherpa vehicle, the Sherpa-ES, on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/spaceflight-will-be-ferrying-payloads-from-orbit-fab-geojump-to-lunar-orbit-next-year/">a lunar flyby mission next year. </a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Qualcomm today launched a new developer platform for building head-worn augmented reality experiences: the Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform. The only supported hardware for the platform is currently Lenovo&#8217;s ThinkReality A3 smart glasses (paired with a Motorola phone), but it will expand to include hardware from Oppo and Xiaomi in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>To build out the software ecosystem, Qualcomm lined up a wide range of partners, including Epic Games&#8217;s Unreal Engine, Niantic&#8217;s Lightship platform, Unity, Viacom CBS and others. Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile U.S. are also partnering with Qualcomm to support startups that use Snapdragon Spaces through the <a href="https://www.hubraum.com/">hubraum</a> program.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230185" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230185" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2230185" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230185" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230182" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For now, only a small number of developers will have access to the program. These currently include the likes of Felix &amp; Paul Studios, holo|one, Overlay, Scope AR, TRIPP, Tiny Rebel Games, NZXR, forwARdgame, Resolution Games and TriggerGlobal. It plans to make the platform generally available in the spring of next year.</p>
<p>The company also today announced that it has acquired &#8220;the team and certain technology assets from HINS SAS and its wholly owned subsidiary, <a href="https://clayair.io/">Clay AIR</a>, Inc.&#8221; for its hand tracking and gesture recognition solutions. This is in addition to Qualcomm&#8217;s acquisition of Wikitude in 2019, another move that helped it jumpstart its AR efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dating back to 2007, we had R&amp;D programs, looking into augmented reality with algorithms like VIO [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_odometry">visual-inertial odometry</a>] on smartphones,&#8221; said Hugo Swart, Qualcomm&#8217;s vice president and GM of XR, in a press briefing ahead of today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We enabled, through the last decade, devices like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/an-ar-glasses-pioneer-collapses/">ODG</a>. In 2014, we created new chips dedicated to virtual reality and augmented reality &#8212; and we are here for the long run. We know that we&#8217;re not there &#8212; it&#8217;s still going to require investment until we get to the holy grail of AR glasses that can do both fully immersive and augmented experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230220" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces_partners.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230220" class="size-full wp-image-2230220" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qualcomm_spaces_partners.jpg" alt="" width="1024" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230220" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s platform is able to support features like local anchors and persistence, hand tracking, object recognition and tracking, plane detection, occlusion spatial mapping and meshing.</p>
<p>With this platform, Qualcomm wants to lower the barriers for developers to build AR experiences. They will get access to documentation, sample code, tutorial and additional tooling to quickly build basic AR applications. To further help companies who want to build for this ecosystem, Qualcomm is also opening up an additional program, dubbed Pathfinder. With this, they will get early access software tools and hardware development kits, additional funding for their projects and co-marketing and promotion from Qualcomm.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round brings the company’s valuation to $4.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion this March </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/socure-raises-100m-at-1-3b-valuation-proving-identity-verification-is-hotter-than-ever/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when it raised $100 million for its Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its new valuation makes Socure the highest-valued private company in the identity verification space, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.baincapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bain Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.tigerglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined the round as new investors. Existing investors</span><a href="https://commerce.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Commerce Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.scalevp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Scale Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.sorensoncapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorenson Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also participated. The round brings its total funding raised to $646 million since it was founded in 2012.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socure’s identity resolution engine uses predictive analytics to parse over 8 billion records, providing a multi-dimensional picture of a consumer’s identity for fraud detection purposes, even for hard-to-identify populations, including those who are Gen Z, credit-invisible or new to the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socure’s customer base includes 12 of the top 15 banks and a roster of fintech companies, online gaming providers and crypto exchanges &#8212; Voyager, Public, Stash and DraftKings, to name a few. Socure CEO Johnny Ayers told TechCrunch that about 35% of its customers today are not in the financial services sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use the funds in two ways &#8212; to execute on its mission to “verify 100% of good identities and completely eliminate identity fraud” and to increase its investments “across the entire identity verification lifecycle,” further developing proofing and authentication processes, per Ayers. Ayers anticipates seeing rapid growth in Socure’s online gaming, cryptocurrency and e-commerce marketplace clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the company is also expanding its partnerships with state and federal government actors to help them invest in digital identity technology </span><a href="https://www.socure.com/about/press-release/socure-names-digital-identity-leader-matt-thompson-as-general-manager-of-public-sector-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">after hiring a new head of its public sector business last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One such use case for Socure is verifying identities to prevent unemployment fraud, cases of which cost the U.S. a total of </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/06/12/the-most-brazen-400-billion-unemployment-funds-heist-in-history/?sh=7720f3302020" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$400 billion in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundraise comes on the heels of rapid growth in the identity verification space as companies conduct more and more business online, driving demand for more robust security and fraud prevention solutions. The tailwind of digitization helped Socure grow from approximately 350 customers served in March, mostly concentrated in financial services, to nearly 1,000 today across a wider range of industries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Webster, chief risk officer of Socure client SoFi, explained his view on what differentiates Socure from its competitors in a written statement to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most players in the space have created point solutions to solve one aspect of digital identity – name, address, device, email, or phone number – but lack the data science insights of Socure’s Sigma+ score that definitively and reliably answers two questions using their multivariate data: ‘Is the applicant a real person? Is the applicant who they say they are?’” Webster wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Ayers confirmed that Socure is considering going public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be in a position where in 2023, we have all of our ducks in a row,” Ayers said of the IPO preparation process. “We will certainly come to market here in the not-too-distant future.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Richard Socher, former chief scientist at Salesforce, and his co-founders at <a href="http://you.com">You.com</a> have been on a mission over the last year to build a different type of search engine, and today the company is releasing a public beta, while announcing a hefty $20 million seed investment.</p>
<p>The new search engine doesn&#8217;t use a scrolling vertical set of results as you see on every search engine out there. Socher and team wanted to throw out assumptions and come up with something entirely new.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design actually took a lot of iterations. and we tried to have a beginner&#8217;s mindset and tried to really innovate with search. In some ways it&#8217;s crazy, but the main idea of a vertical list is now getting more and more interspersed and cluttered with other things [like ads] and hasn&#8217;t changed in 20 years,&#8221; Socher told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They went to work to change that and came up with something completely different. For starters the search results page is linked to different apps such as Medium, Yelp and Reddit. You can customize the importance of those apps, or you can choose to not use a particular one at all, as you wish.</p>
<p>The results appear in categories by app along with a web results category, and you scroll left to right to see results in a particular app or category. What&#8217;s more, you can see the results such as video or a code snippet without actually opening a fresh tab, saving time and keystrokes while reducing tab overload.</p>
<p>If you like a certain set of results better, you can move them up in the results, and You.com will remember that in the future and present you the results you like better next time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231163" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231163" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2231163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThanksgivingSideDishes-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Thanksgiving side dishes search in you.com.

Photo credit: You.com</p></div></p>
<p>Socher says that the founders chose the name because it&#8217;s about what you as a user need from the search engine. &#8220;We are true to our name. It&#8217;s about you. So you actually can choose here and say &#8216;I want to see more Reddit or I want to see less Reddit,'&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t make sense to display results from Reddit, like when you&#8217;re looking for a Thai restaurant near you, it will display Yelp results at the top instead. If you don&#8217;t like Yelp results, it can simply display web results, but this ability to customize gives you a lot of flexibility and control over the results you see.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about this level of customization making the results too one dimensional, especially when choosing news sources, the items you don&#8217;t want to see displayed prominently don&#8217;t disappear, they simply move down the list of results. If you don&#8217;t care about the customization features, you can let the search engine display the results for you.</p>
<p>For starters, they are focusing on developers and privacy aware users. They had considered shopping as a primary use case, but in testing they found when they linked to retailer product catalogues, alpha users thought results were ads when they were actually pages from a catalogue. They decided to move onto other use cases.</p>
<p>Developers can search for things like code snippets. They are able to quickly scroll horizontally through the set of snippets, find something, copy and paste it, and be done much faster than in Google or even a privacy-focused search engine like DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>For people concerned about privacy, you can go into what Socher calls true Incognito mode where everything about you including your IP address is hidden. The search engine is designed to make it simple to move in and out of Incognito mode, so if you need your location turned on to find a restaurant, you can turn off privacy mode, then quickly turn it back on.</p>
<p>In terms of monetization, the company vows never to sell your data to a third party, but for now they are simply trying to get the design down and grow the user base. Socher says the company will concentrate on monetization later. There will probably be ads at some point, he says, but without connecting the query to a user, and without cluttering the results.</p>
<p>As an example, if you search for air purifier you may get an ad for that, but the company displaying that ad won&#8217;t have direct access to data about you, as is the case now with most online ads. The devil will be in the details here, of course, but this is how Socher is describing it.</p>
<p>The company also announced a $20 million Seed investment led by Time Ventures, his former boss, Marc Benioff&#8217;s private venture fund, with participation from Breyer Capital, Sound Ventures, Day One Ventures and a long list of industry angels.</p>
<p>Up until today the search engine has been in private beta with a couple of thousand users, but starting today anyone can try it. If you&#8217;re using Chrome, you can download the extension.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online stock trading platform Robinhood has confirmed it was hacked last week with more than five million customer email addresses and two million customer names were taken, as well as a much smaller set of more specific customer data.</p>
<p>The company said in <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident">a blog post</a> that a malicious hacker had socially engineered a customer service representative over the phone November 3 to get access to customer support systems. That allowed the hacker to obtain customer names and email addresses, but also the additional full names, dates of birth and ZIP code of 310 customers.</p>
<p>Robinhood said that 10 customers had &#8220;more extensive account details revealed.&#8221; Robinhood did not say what information specifically, though no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed and caused no immediate financial loss to customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231152" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s precisely that kind of information that malicious hackers can use to facilitate further attacks against victims, like targeted phishing emails, since names and dates of birth can often be used to verify a person&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>The company said once it secured its systems the hacker then &#8220;demanded an extortion payment.&#8221; Robinhood instead notified law enforcement and security firm Mandiant to investigate the breach.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar breach to how Twitter was hacked in July 2020. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/decrypted-teenager-twitter-hacker-garmin-ransomware/">then-teenage hacker</a> used social engineering techniques to trick some of Twitter&#8217;s employees into thinking the hacker was an employee, allowing the hacker access to an internal Twitter &#8220;admin&#8221; tool, which he used to hijack high-profile accounts and spread a cryptocurrency scam. The attack netted the hacker just over $100,000 in cryptocurrency. In its aftermath, Twitter rolled out security keys to its staff to toughen its defenses against attacks that prevent these kinds of attacks from working in the future.</p>
<p>Whatever lacking security controls that allowed a hacker to trick a Robinhood customer service representative into granting them access to an internal system is a likely focus for its investigation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.truveta.com/">Truveta</a> wants to collect privacy-safe medical data from around the United States on a regular basis, making it available for researchers to sift and parse. The company is making real progress towards that goal in product terms, and this morning said it raised another $100 million, giving it a capital base of around $200 million in total.</p>
<p>But the financial aspect, and the fact that Truveta has secured more partners in the medical world to supply it with information, are ancillary to the fact that the startup has started to make its platform available to external parties.</p>
<p>Truveta partners with around 20 medical providers, aggregating regular de-identified data from 42 American states and myriad patients into its collection. From there it has built a software service that allows researchers and other users to ask questions of the collected data. TechCrunch was given a tour of the Truveta product, which, as chart nerds, we liked.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231125" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But frankly, your local technology writer is not precisely the Truveta end-user. Instead, the product is aimed at individuals with their hands in the public health domain. To that end, the company&#8217;s product lets researchers include and exclude elements of the population, before dropping the user into a Jupyter Notebook, from where they can build a dashboard with data that updates daily.</p>
<p>Truveta has eyes on 16% of all clinical care in the United States, per CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/tmyerson">Terry Myerson</a>, who formerly worked with Microsoft.</p>
<p>The company shared a grip of COVID-19 related material this morning that it has gleaned from its own product. It turns out that &#8220;adverse events&#8221; happen to fewer than 1% of folks with a full COVID-19 vaccine, with Moderna patients showing 40% more than those who received Pfizer. Given that I am a Moderna Man and my spouse is Team Pfizer, I was amused by that latter stat. Perhaps I&#8217;ll mix-and-match my booster?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YGP66G0M2v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/">Can data fix healthcare?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can data fix healthcare?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/can-data-fix-healthcare/embed/#?secret=YGP66G0M2v" data-secret="YGP66G0M2v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Truveta is more interesting for its long-term potential than for what it has managed to learn thus far, in my view. It&#8217;s good news for our country that the company is starting to open up access to external parties, and has a product that can ingest mountains of data and share it in a privacy-safe manner. Our healthcare system is expensive, siloed, antiquated, and rife with inefficiencies. Truveta could make things a bit more open and, if we are lucky, clear.</p>
<p>What will prove interesting from this juncture is how Truveta converts itself from an interesting — and now operating — project into a business. It has a pretty firm anti-advertising stance, saying in its self-description that its service is &#8220;licensed for ethical medical research [and] not to target advertising to patients or physicians.&#8221; Fair enough, but do researchers have the coin to make the project work? Perhaps Truveta will sell its service back to its data providers, each contributing both data and regular fees to the company?</p>
<p>Truveta notes in its self-produced bio that it pays taxes. Hence, it isn&#8217;t a non-profit. That means at least an attempt at future profitability, which will keep our business model questions at the front of our minds. But with $100 million in new capital, Truveta is hardly about to run short on cash.</p>
<p>All told, Truveta has rapidly scaled its partner base and tech stack to the point of market viability. Let&#8217;s see what demand is attracted, and how quickly positive health <em>and</em> business outcomes can be ascertained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With restaurants having difficulty hiring workers, as is the environment today, one company is developing a hiring platform and restaurant worker network that aims to make that easier.</p>
<p>Seasoned announced Tuesday it received $18.7 million in a Series A round of funding to continue developing its mobile app employee networking and recruitment tools that are being used by more than 250,000 restaurant workers.</p>
<p>Some 800,000 jobs at eating and drinking places were still open as of October, according to <a href="https://restaurant.org/research/economy/indicators/restaurant-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Seasoned CEO Ware Sykes told TechCrunch that restaurant hiring was a pre-pandemic problem that was exacerbated over the past 18 months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230775" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sykes saw the limited ability for restaurants to advertise their job openings and created Seasoned to change that. There are two sides to the app: a free community for industry employees to review openings, schedule interviews and connect with peers, while a subscription-based hiring tool for restaurant managers works to lower onboarding costs and accelerate the timing between application and hire to within three hours.</p>
<p>“The purpose is to bring the service industry together — the worker and the restaurant — so that both can have success,” he added. “We have a social community where workers can find a job in 24 hours. Most other products are not built for the restaurant, but we have a mobile solution for both sides.”</p>

<p>Remote-first Seasoned is the latest company receiving investment for hourly worker tools. For example, Fountain announced an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/as-companies-search-for-hourly-workers-fountain-brings-in-85m-to-assist-them/">$85 million Series C round</a> last week for its applicant tracking system, while Workstream recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/workstreams-text-based-recruitment-tool-gets-a-48m-bet-from-bond-and-beyond/">$48 million in Series B</a> funding for its text-based recruitment approach. In addition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/bite-ninja-scoops-up-pre-seed-funding-to-reimagine-restaurant-working-environments/">Bite Ninja</a> secured some pre-seed and seed funding to continue developing its software that enables workers to pick up drive-thru shifts from home.</p>
<p>The two-sided app differentiates Seasoned from the others, Sykes said. He believes that unique business model was the driver for the company’s successful launch in Dallas in 2020, where in the first year it attracted over 300 brands operating 100,000 locations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest funding round was led by Horizons Ventures and includes TPG Growth and existing investors. It follows a $12 million seed round raised in June to bring the company’s total funding to over $30 million since the company was founded a year ago.</p>
<p>Sykes intends to deploy the new capital into expanding into new markets. In addition to Dallas, it has already added Houston, Austin, Orlando and Miami and is expected to go national in the next year. He also intends to hire across the board in areas like product, technology, go-to-market and data science.</p>
<p>“This has become a movement,” he added. “A year ago, restaurants were listing wages and now they are offering sign-on bonuses and lifting wages across the board. The more data we get, the more we can see what kinds of benefits are attractive for employees.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By the time your baby is crying in the crib, they are over-stimulated and grumpy as can be. <a href="https://cradlewise.com/product/smart-crib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cradlewise</a> is a $2,000 smart crib that monitors a baby&#8217;s depth of sleep, and automatically tries to soothe your little bundle of joy back to sleep as soon as the first signs of wakefulness come along.</p>
<p>The company started taking preorders at CES in 2021, and initially focused on customers in the Bay Area, to keep the feedback loop from Cradlewise&#8217;s customers as tight as possible. To date, around 100 units of the smart crib have been sold, and the company is continuing to take preorders at a discounted price of $1,499.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $7 million seed round was led by </span><a href="https://www.footwork.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Footwork, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with participation from </span><a href="http://www.crv.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and follow-on from existing investors <a href="https://sosv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOSV</a> and <a href="https://www.bettercapital.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better Capital</a>. Other notable investors participating in the round include founder of Stitch Fix Katrina Lake, CEO of Italic Jeremy Cai, CTO of Molekule Dilip Goswami and ex-CEO of Misfit Wearables Sonny Vu. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224627" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2224642" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224642" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2224642" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bounce-bounce.gif" alt="" width="300" height="169" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224642" class="wp-caption-text">The Cradlewise cradle&#8217;s bouncing motion is designed after how a human would soothe a baby back to sleep. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cradlewise</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;There are 50 baby monitors on the market that will notify you when your baby wakes up. That&#8217;s too late. When my husband and I had our first baby, we quickly learned that as soon as she twitched, we ran over and rocked her. You can&#8217;t do that every time &#8212; you can&#8217;t watch the baby 24/7. Why isn&#8217;t there a crib that can monitor for signs of waking,&#8221; wondered Radhika Patil, the co-founder and CEO of Cradlewise. Excellent question &#8212; and when they failed to find a smart crib that acted the way they wanted, they decided to build one, starting with the quality of the bounce. &#8220;A lot of the cribs available in the market are not intuitive in the way the would rock the child. So we modeled our motion after the way I would bounce our children at 3 am on a yoga ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>The journey started from a combination of curiosity and the &#8220;quantified self&#8221; movement. Radhika and her husband <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bharath Patil</span> were heavily invested in tracking their own sleep and fitness patterns, and when their first baby was born in 2014, they built a prototype of the Cradlewise for her. The idea stayed on the back burner until 2019 when the idea was revived fully, the company raised some cash, and the work started in earnest.</p>
<p>The new money raised unlocks a new round of growth for Cradlewise. The team told me they are working on building out its 11-person team further, and focusing on technology advancements and supply-chain and operations associated with delivering a pretty complex product. The company wants to make more advanced sleep analytics available, and potentially add a smart scale to the crib, to ensure that a baby&#8217;s weight can be tracked along with their sleep patterns. The ultimate goal is to make Cradlewise the centerpiece of a smart nursery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The final product the team created was a rather pricy cradle, and I asked the team whether the price tag made sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very careful that the sleep monitor only checks the footprint of the crib &#8212; there are wall-mounted products out there, but that has serious privacy issues. So we combine early wakeup detection, the natural bouncing movement that imitates how a parent bounces a baby,&#8221; Radhika Patil explains, arguing that the price tag makes sense for a premium product that replaces several baby products. She also highlights the crib&#8217;s green credentials, including a reduction of plastics, and the inclusion of easy-to-recycle materials: &#8220;The mattress is made from coconut coir and natural rubber latex. This means that the mattress is fully biodegradable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says it doesn&#8217;t have plans for a second-hand market for its cribs yet, but suggests that the cradle can be disinfected pretty easily, and the mattress can be discarded and replaced by a new one from the company &#8212; hence the focus on making the mattress itself biodegradable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cradlewise is the only baby product in the market that uses deep tech and AI to learn the baby&#8217;s sleep patterns and growth trends. With software updates that build on this rich data, a characteristic of the very best connected hardware companies such as Nest, Peloton, Tesla and Tonal, Cradlewise is pioneering the connected nursery,&#8221; said Nikhil Basu Trivedi, co-founder and general partner at Footwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cradlewise isn&#8217;t just a smart crib, it is a mental health solution for parents,&#8221; said Kristin Baker Spohn, general partner at CRV. “Having spent much of my career focused on the intersection of technology and health, Cradlewise is a great example of how smart technology can be used to help ensure that both babies and their parents can get a good night’s rest, which is truly one of the most important elements for staying healthy.”</span></p>
<p>The crib is sized so babies up to the age of two can use it, and <a href="https://cradlewise.com/product/smart-crib/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preorders continue on Cradlewise&#8217;s website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cascade.io/">Cascade Labs</a> helps operations teams automate their data workflows. Using the company&#8217;s no-code tools, teams can pull in data from their favorite sources, transform it as needed, analyze it and then automatically kick off specific processes based on the results. The company today announced that it has raised a $5.3 million seed round led by First Round Capital. Redpoint Partners, Susa Ventures and a number of angel investors also participated in this round.</p>
<p>Cascade Labs was co-founded by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakefuentes">Jake Fuentes</a> and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brelig">Jon Brelig</a>. Fuentes previously co-founded personal finance service Level Money, which Capital One acquired in 2015. Brelig previously co-founded InfoScout (now Numerator), where he was the CTO until he and Brelig co-founded Cascade Labs in September 2019.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231042" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231042" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231042" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=1536,869 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade3.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231042" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cascade Labs</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231028" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Brelig noted that while at InfoScout, he saw that a lot of ops and analyst teams were often highly skilled at analyzing data but not necessary tech savvy enough to automate their workflows to, for example, build complex weekly reports without a lot of manual labor.</p>
<p>Fuentes, meanwhile, had seen similar issues, but from a slighty different perspective. &#8220;I sold my last company to Capital One and as you can imagine, that&#8217;s a highly analytical place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the degree to which people on the ground that knew the business well could access the huge reams of data that we had access to was still fairly limited. So after I left Capital One and Jon and I started talking about this problem we were: &#8216;maybe this is actually the same thing&#8217; &#8212; and that&#8217;s how Cascade got started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fuentes admitted that there are obviously a lot of tools out there that help businesses access and explore data. But the team argues that there is still a disconnect between exploring data and then putting it to work. &#8220;That&#8217;s the type of thing that fraud operations needed in Capital One, for example, and InfoScout needed to serve clients properly,&#8221; Fuentes said. &#8220;I think to get to that level of operationalizing data, it needs a slightly different toolkit than what we currently have today.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231041" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231041" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=1536,869 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cascade1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2231041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cascade Labs</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to build fancy dashboards but it&#8217;s another to build a data tool that takes this data and then, for example, helps a scooter company plan nightly pickups for recharging and repairs. With Cascade Labs, operations teams can easily take data from most common sources (or a CSV file, if needed) and then create workflows around that. That may include basic transformations and other standard data operations, but Cascade Labs also offers some predictive capabilities. Typically, at the end of those workflows is an action. That could be emails to the employees of the scooter operators about which scooters to bring in for repairs, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Looker was on the head end of a transformation that&#8217;s still going on, which is how do you get the right data to the right people in the organization that are really running the business,&#8221; Bill Trenchard, partner at First Round, told me. &#8220;I look at what Cascade [Labs] doing as an evolution of them. They are really at the intersection of kind of two movements: no-code tools, empowering non-technical creators to build like engineers &#8212; and the rise of the modern data stack. The combination of both is allowing companies to utilize data in entirely new ways like never before.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that while there are lots of integration tools that produce dashboards, Cascade Labs is about getting the right data to the right people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most companies would kill for Peloton’s level of user buy-in. The company’s cycling and treadmill products have built an almost cult-like mystique around the connected fitness platform. It’s a level of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/peloton/">devotion</a> that had seemingly only grown during the pandemic, in spite of setbacks, including shipping delays and a pair of recalls.</p>
<p>In spite of numerous claims surrounding the supposed death of the gym, however, re-openings<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/11/05/peloton-sales-gym-memberships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> have begun to impact the company’s bottom line</a>. How can a company in Peloton’s position hamper such a slide? The quick and easy answer is to expand into additional home fitness categories. And while the best time for the Peloton Guide to arrive would have been, say, March 2020, it seems entirely possible that the new hardware could goes a ways toward keeping the company well positioned in the home fitness space.</p>
<p>Recent rumors found Peloton jumping feet first into the booming world of home rowing machines alongside brands like Hydro &#8212; and while such a move still seems entirely likely, today’s announcement is more firmly targeted at the likes of Tempo and Tonal. And, perhaps most importantly, it finds the company releasing its most inexpensive hardware to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230715" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Peloton Guide’s $495 price point is a full $1,000 less expensive than its cheapest product, the Bike. That’s due, in no small part, to the fact that it’s the least intensive of the bunch. That price gets you the Guide (effectively a camera system that plugs into a TV), a heart-rate band and a remote control. Other strength training essentials are user-supplied &#8212; something the company spins as a plus in the material, noting, “Members will be able to use their own equipment, weights, or accessories and won’t need any bulky devices to get started with their strength experience.” So, BYOW.</p>
<p>It’s pricier than the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/tempo-launches-a-400-home-fitness-system-the-size-of-a-minifridge/">recently announced Tempo Move</a>, a $395 mini-fridge-sized product that comes preloaded with its own weights. The other big difference on the hardware side, however, is that Tempo’s product relies on a user’s smartphone &#8212; which automatically reduces the potential user base to those with newer iPhones.</p>

<p>Instead, the Peloton Guide is built around the company’s own camera system. Here’s what the company has to say about its feature set:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Peloton Guide makes strength training appealing and motivating to beginners and experts alike by using machine learning, a type of AI that uses data to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal input from an engineer, to enhance the renowned Peloton strength class experience. Peloton Guide uses ML to help Members track their movements and progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>The system works with the company’s existing range of strength courses, which, it notes, “has been the fastest growing discipline for Peloton.” The monthly content fee is $13. The Guide won’t quite hit the holiday cutoff, but it should be around for those New Year’s resolutions, arriving in early 2022 in the U.S. and Canada. Users in the U.K., Australia and Germany will have to wait until later in the year.</p>

Now for the first time, the company is introducing a vertical home feed featuring images of dishes and more, designed to help people discover local restaurants.</p>
<p>The feed will first and foremost feature &#8220;popular dishes and other trending photos from consumers, including food photos or interior and exterior shots of the restaurants,&#8221; Yelp said. Much like Google and other types of news feeds, the content shown is based on your proximity to the business, the freshness of content and a dish&#8217;s popularity.</p>
<p>When you click on a restaurant&#8217;s dish, you&#8217;ll be directed to see more photos and reviews of that dish. Yelp uses machine learning to pick out those dishes based on reviews, then pairs them with photos and reviews of the dish. Clicking on other images, like the interior or exterior of a restaurant, will take you to the business page and show you more photos and info.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The other feature, Yelp Connect, is a paid feature for restaurant owners. It allows businesses to share updates with new and existing customers directly to home feed, helping their posts gain visibility (and Yelp more ad revenue, no doubt). Yelp said that it&#8217;s initial testing showed it may lift a restaurant&#8217;s consumer engagement up to 30 percent.</p>
<p>The new experience is arriving today on iOS exclusively in 150 cities in 25 US states, Yelp said. There&#8217;s no word yet on an Android release, but the company said to &#8220;stay tuned for additional updates.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new valuation is more than double what the Brussels-based company announced last year when it secured $112.5 million in a Series F investment that put its valuation at $2.3 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more data moves to the cloud, it often still lives in multiple places on a business’ network, making it difficult for organizations to understand and access the right data they need and easier for data breaches to occur.</p>
<p><a href="http://collibra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collibra</a>, which provides tools to find, understand, access and analyze data, announced today that it raised $250 million in Series G funding, at a post-money valuation of $5.25 billion. Its products help customers comply with local data protection policies and store data securely.</p>
<p>The new valuation is more than double what the Brussels-based company announced last year when it secured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/collibra-nabs-another-112-5m-at-a-2-3b-valuation-for-its-big-data-management-platform/">$112.5 million in a Series F investment</a> that put its valuation at $2.3 billion. That followed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/regulatory-demands-for-better-data-governance-push-collibras-valuation-above-1-billion/">a $100 million investment in 2019</a> at a valuation of just over $1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230793" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The valuation is a strong reflection of our position in the market,” Felix Van de Maele, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “If you look around, we have the highest valuation among our competitors and this is a reflection of growth. We are very excited to more than double our valuation in 18 months.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Collibra nabs another $112.5M at a $2.3B valuation for its big data management platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/collibra-nabs-another-112-5m-at-a-2-3b-valuation-for-its-big-data-management-platform/embed/#?secret=K51NOR1EbH" data-secret="K51NOR1EbH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The latest round of funding was co-led by Sequoia Capital Global Equities and Sofina, with participation from new investor Tiger Global Management and existing investors Battery Ventures, CapitalG, Dawn Capital, Durable Capital Partners LP, ICONIQ Capital and Index Ventures.</p>
<p>Collibra was spun out of Vrije Universiteit in Belgium in 2008 and today it works with more than 500 enterprises and other large organizations like AWS, Google Cloud, Snowflake and Tableau. It has over 900 employees working remotely and in hubs, including Brussels, New York City, Atlanta and Poland.</p>
<p>The funding follows record growth by the company, including the acquisition of OwlDQ, a provider of predictive data quality software, in February, Van de Maele said.</p>
<p>“There is a ‘Renaissance’ around data and fueling artificial intelligence models,” he added. “These were manually done before, and now we use AI and machine learning to automate models. It is how we observe the data infrastructure and prepare for problems.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When the company first started, the complexity of the data landscape included millions of data assets, and now that landscape is on the road to billions. To scale to this volume and manage the growth associated, Collibra went after the new funding.</p>
<p>Van de Maele said he “is excited” to have Sequoia and Tiger in the cap table this time around and that existing investors have come back. His goal with investors was to find those that would continue to partner with the company over the long-term.</p>
<p>The new capital will be deployed into expanding its presence across the United States, Europe, Middle East and Australia. Van de Maele expects to make significant hires in engineering, sales and product, essentially doubling Collibra’s workforce by 2023. It will also invest in R&amp;D, customer success and go-to-market so that it can continue providing new features for its Data Intelligence Cloud offering.</p>
<p>Though the company has been around for over a decade, Van de Maele still considers the data intelligence space to be early, especially as larger enterprise companies come onboard.</p>
<p>“The complexity and chaos is at a different level, and what we hear is that they want one platform, not five different tools,” he added. “More organizations need that foundation, but just putting data from one place into a data lake is not going to solve the problem of getting value from it.”</p>
