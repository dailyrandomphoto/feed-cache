										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following moves by major tech platforms to better protect minors using their platforms, Snapchat is preparing to introduce its own set of &#8220;family engagement&#8221; tools in the coming months. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel teased the planned offering during an interview at the <a href="https://www.wsjtechlive.com/">WSJ Tech Live</a> conference this week, where he explained that the new product will essentially function as a family center that gives parents better visibility into how teens are using its service and provide privacy controls.</p>
<p>Spiegel stressed Snapchat&#8217;s more private nature as a tool for communicating with friends, noting that Snapchat user profiles were already private by default &#8212; something that differentiated it from some social media rivals until recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the entire way this service is constructed really promotes a safe experience regardless of what age you are, but we never market our service to people under the age of 13,&#8221; he said, then added Snap is now working on new features that would allow parents to feel more comfortable with the app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t announced the name of this product yet, but we basically have a family center so that young people and their parents can use Snapchat together,&#8221; Spiegel said. This product would give parents more visibility into who their teenage users may be talking to on Snapchat and their privacy settings, among other things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that at least helps start a conversation between young people and their parents about what they&#8217;re experiencing on our service,&#8221; Spiegel said. These types of conversations can be a learning experience for both parents and teens alike, and can give parents the opportunity to guide their teens through some of the difficulties that come with using social media &#8212; like how to navigate uncomfortable situations, such as what to do if a stranger contacts you, for example.</p>
<p>Snap in June <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/family-pushes-social-media-apps-to-allow-access-for-parental-control-tools-115288133596">had shared this sort of work was on its roadmap</a>, when parents who lost their son to a drug overdose were advocating for the company to work with third-party parental control software applications. At the time, Snap said that it was being careful about sharing private user data with third parties and that it was looking into developing its own parental controls, as a solution. (Recently, the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/snapchat-is-launching-new-tools-to-crack-down-on-illicit-drug-sales-on-its-platform/"> released tools</a> to crack down on illicit drug sales in Snapchat to address this particular issue.)</p>
<p>Reached for comment on Spiegel&#8217;s remarks at the WSJ event, a Snap spokesperson confirmed the new family engagement tools will combine both an educational component as well as tools meant to be used by parents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our overall goal is to help educate and empower young people to make the right choices to enhance their online safety and to help parents be partners with their kids in navigating the digital world,&#8221; a spokesperson said. &#8220;When we build new products or features, we try to do it in a way that reflects natural human behaviors and relationships &#8212; and the parental tools we are developing are meant to give parents better insights to help protect their kids, in ways that don’t compromise their privacy or data security, are legally compliant and offered at no charge to families within Snapchat,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>The company said it looked forward to sharing more details about the family tools &#8220;soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parental controls will be under the purview of <a href="https://www.axios.com/snap-hire-beauchere-global-platform-safety-14d8b989-6480-440a-8207-0dfd2edc7ac4.html">Snap&#8217;s new Global Head of Platform Safety,</a> Jacqueline Beauchere, who recently joined the company from Microsoft, where she had served as Chief Online Safety Officer.</p>
<p>Her hiring comes at a time as regulatory scrutiny of social media companies and big tech, in general, has heated up.</p>
<p>As U.S. lawmakers <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-rep-castor-reintroduce-legislation-to-protect-children-and-teens-from-online-manipulation-and-harm">consider legislation</a> that would require tech companies to implement new safeguards to better protect minors on their services, tech companies have been trying to get ahead of the coming crackdown by putting into place their own interpretations of those rules now.</p>
<p>Already, many of the top tech platforms used by teens have implemented parental controls or have adjusted their default settings to be more private, or have done both.</p>
<p>TikTok, for example, having just put a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">multi-million dollar FTC fine </a>behind it for its children&#8217;s privacy violations, led the way with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/tiktok-introduces-parental-controls-with-new-family-safety-mode-feature-launching-first-in-u-k/">introduction</a> of its &#8220;Family Safety Mode&#8221; feature in 2020. Those tools became<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/"> globally available</a> in spring 2020. Then, at the start of this year, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">announced</a> it would change the privacy settings and defaults for all its users under the age of 18.</p>
<p>In March, Instagram followed with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/instagram-adds-new-teen-safety-tools-as-competition-with-tiktok-heats-up/">new teen safety tools</a> of its own, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">changed its default settings for minors</a> later in the summer in addition to restricting ad targeting. Google, meanwhile,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/youtube-to-launch-parental-control-features-for-families-with-tweens-and-teens/"> launched new parental controls on YouTube</a> in February, then further <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">increased its minor protections</a> across Search, YouTube, and other platforms in August. This also included making the default settings more private and limiting ad targeting.</p>
<p>Snap, however, had not yet made any similar moves, despite the fact that the company regularly touts how much its app is used by the younger demographic. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/snapchat-rolls-out-new-tool-aimed-at-helping-young-users-run-for-office/">Currently, Snap says</a> its app reaches 90% of 13 to 24-year-olds in the U.S. &#8212; a percentage that&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/snapchat-ad-network/">remained</a> fairly consistent over the past few years.</p>
<p>The company, however, is not against the idea of additional legal requirements in the area of minor protections.</p>
<p>Spiegel, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-02-17/facebook-needs-regulation-zuckerberg">like other</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai-calls-for-federal-tech-regulation-investments-in-cybersecurity/"> tech execs have</a> lately, agreed some regulation may be necessary. But he cautioned that regulation isn&#8217;t a panacea for the ills big tech has wrought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the important point to make is that regulation is not a substitute for moral responsibility and for business practices that support the health and well-being of your community &#8212; because regulation just happens far too late,&#8221; Spiegel said. &#8220;So, I think regulation certainly may be necessary in some of these areas &#8212; I think other countries have made strides in that regard &#8212; but again, unless businesses are proactively promoting the health and well-being of their community, regulators are always going to be playing catch up,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla continued its profitability streak, reporting Wednesday net income of $1.62 billion in the third quarter, a nearly fivefold increase from the $331 million it earned in the same period last year. The record-setting profit came thanks to record sales and despite a global chip shortage and supply chain constraints that has affected the industry.</p>
<p>Notably, Tesla was able to earn that record net income (on a GAAP basis) even as the vast majority of its sales came from its cheaper Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles. Tesla did take a Bitcoin-related impairment of $51 million in the quarter, ended September 30. Shares fell less than 1% in after market trading to $859.80.</p>
<p>Tesla reported that operating income was $2 billion, which increased year over year from $809 million. Operating income also grew 54% from the $1.3 billion reported in the second quarter. The company also generated $13.76 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 56% increase from the $8.77 billion it reported the same period last year. Revenue was also 15% higher than $11.96 billion reported in the second quarter of 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221238" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Tesla fancies itself an energy, technology and sustainability company, the bulk of its revenues still come from the sale of electric vehicles. Tesla&#8217;s automotive revenue was $12 billion in the third quarter, up 50% from the same period last year. About $279 million of that automotive revenue came from the sale of regulatory credits, the lowest since the fourth quarter in 2019. Meanwhile, Tesla&#8217;s automotive gross margins on a GAAP basis popped to 30.5%, a historic high for the metric.</p>
<p>The results beat analysts expectations. Analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance expected revenue of $13.62 billion. Analysts surveyed by Factset forecast revenue of $13.6 billion and a profit of $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>For now, the success of the company hinges on its ability to produce and sell EVs (as opposed to solar and energy storage, two other products it manufactures and sells) as well as its ability to make its so-called FSD (Full Self-Driving) software widely available to owners who have purchased the product and are still awaiting a wider rollout. Tesla is facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/us-regulator-targets-tesla-on-ndas-over-the-air-software-updates/">increasing regulatory scrutiny</a> over its tactic of releasing beta software to some owners.</p>
<p>The company noted in its third-quarter earnings report that a &#8220;variety of challenges, including semiconductor shortages, congestion at ports and rolling blackouts, have been impacting our ability to keep factories running at full speed.&#8221; The comments suggest that demand is not a problem and that it is limited only by supply chain and logistical constraints.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Energy storage deployments on a megawatt-hour basis saw a 71% uptick year-over-year, an increase that Tesla said was driven by growth in its commercial Megapack product. That growth did slow between the second and third quarters showing just a 1.6% increase in deployed MWh.</p>
<p>The same story plays out on the solar energy stage. Tesla reported it installed 83 megawatts of solar in the third quarter, a 46% increase year-over-year and a 2.35% drop from the second quarter. The solar installed in the third quarter is the lowest numbers reported in 2021.</p>
<p>The positive results follow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/02/tesla-delivers-record-breaking-number-of-vehicles-in-third-quarter/">record deliveries</a> of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the third quarter. The automaker said it delivered 241,391 electric vehicles in the third quarter, blowing past expectations as other U.S. automakers experienced a drop in sales as the result of a global chip shortage.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Tesla deliveries (some 96%) were its newer Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover. Only 9,275 of the vehicles it delivered were Model X and S. Deliveries grew 20% since the second quarter and were 73% higher than the same period last year.</p>
<p>Production numbers also grew. Tesla produced 237,823 electric vehicles in the third quarter, another record for the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk voiced concerns on Twitter over the recent appointment of Missy Cummings to a key advisory role at the country’s top traffic authority, but U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg suggested the Tesla CEO speak to him directly about any concerns instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s welcome to call me if he&#8217;s concerned,&#8221; Buttigieg told reporters at an event on Wednesday, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-transport-chief-defends-auto-safety-agency-after-musk-criticism-2021-10-20/">Reuters</a>. &#8220;We are responsible for making sure that every vehicle on the road is safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk has taken umbrage with the appointment of Duke University engineering and computer science professor Missy Cummings as a safety advisor at the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA). “Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla,” he said Tuesday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221265" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1450653942938054656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Cummings, who directs the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke, responded that she was “happy to sit down and talk” to Musk anytime.</p>
<p>Cummings has also been a frequent Twitter user, often airing her concerns over Tesla’s driver assistance technology and the company’s methods for rolling it out on the social media platform. In September, she sent <a href="https://twitter.com/missy_cummings/status/1442287205892837377">a series of tweets</a> criticizing Tesla’s roll-out of the “safety score” as a way of allowing drivers access to its “Full Self-Driving” beta program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But her criticisms of Tesla go back much further. Two years ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/missy_cummings/status/1129396566886932480">Cummings said (also on Twitter)</a> that Autopilot, Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system, “easily causes mode confusion, is unreliable and unsafe.” She added that NHTSA should require the automaker to turn it off.</p>
<p>Cummings’ nomination to the safety advisory role at NHTSA could suggest a more conservative stance on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and Tesla at the agency in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, NHTSA and Tesla are no strangers. In August, the agency <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">opened a safety probe</a> into Autopilot, after discovering twelve incidents in which Tesla vehicles crashed into parked emergency vehicles. Regulators also investigated an incident involving a fatal crash in 2017, and 25 further crashes involving Tesla’s ADAS since that time.</p>
<p>As late as August, in response to a tweet asking Cummings whether she thinks FSD could ever achieve full autonomy, she said: <a href="https://twitter.com/missy_cummings/status/1429110593970130954">“my prediction is never.”</a> But that doesn’t mean she necessarily thinks LiDAR – light detection and ranging software tht measures distance with pulses of laser light – is the answer either. Instead, she suggested that full self-driving will not be possible without “<a href="https://twitter.com/missy_cummings/status/1429112183191900170">a complete rethink of reasoning under uncertainty</a>” that can only be brought about through <a href="https://twitter.com/missy_cummings/status/1399757630961295365">advances in deep learning</a>.</p>
<p>Tesla supporters, under the banner “Autopilot Users for Progress,” have started <a href="https://www.change.org/p/president-of-the-united-states-review-appointment-of-missy-cummings-to-nhtsa-for-conflict-of-interest-bias?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_31120814_en-US%3A3&amp;recruiter=1015512490&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition">a Change.org petition</a> urging President Joe Biden and NHTSA staff to review the appointment for concerns regarding conflict of interest and bias.</p>

Macaw is a variant of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/garmin-confirms-ransomware-attack-outage/">the WastedLocker malware</a>, both of which were created by Evil Corp., a Russia-based crime group that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/justice-department-dridex-malware/">subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second ransomware attack to hit the company in as many months, after its networks in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/olympus-confirms-us-cyberattack-weeks-after-blackmatter-ransomware-hit-emea-systems/">knocked offline by the BlackMatter ransomware group</a> in September. (BlackMatter and Evil Corp. are not known to be linked.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221241" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Olympus was hit by BlackMatter last month and then hit by Macaw a week or so ago,&#8221; Allan Liska, a senior threat analyst at security firm Recorded Future, told TechCrunch. Liska said that the Macaw malware leaves behind a ransom note on hacked computers that claims to have stolen data from its victims.</p>
<p>Olympus said <a href="https://www.olympus-global.com/news/2021/nr02223.html">in a statement</a> on Tuesday that the company was investigating the &#8220;likelihood of data exfiltration,&#8221; a common technique by ransomware groups known as &#8220;double extortion,&#8221; where the hackers steal files before encrypting the victim&#8217;s network and threaten to publish the files online if the ransom to decrypt the files is not paid.</p>
<p>When reached on Wednesday, Olympus spokesperson Jennifer Bannan declined to answer our questions or say if the company paid the ransom.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the best interests of the security of our system, our customers and their patients, we will not comment on criminal actors and their actions, if any. We are committed to providing appropriate notifications to impacted stakeholders,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Treasury sanctions make it more difficult for companies based or operating in the United States to pay a ransom to get their files back, since U.S. nationals are <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845">&#8220;generally prohibited&#8221;</a> from transacting with sanctioned entities. Evil Corp. has renamed and modified its malware <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-evil-corp-ransomware-mimics-payloadbin-gang-to-evade-us-sanctions/">several times</a> to circumvent U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/sinclair-broadcast-hack-linked-to-notorious-russian-cybergang?sref=gni836kR">reported Wednesday</a> that the Macaw malware was also used to cause widespread disruption last week at Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns or operates 185 television stations across more than 80 markets. Sinclair said in <a href="https://sbgi.net/pr-news/sinclair-broadcast-group-provides-information-on-cybersecurity-incident/">a statement</a> on Monday that while some data was stolen from Sinclair&#8217;s network, it wasn&#8217;t clear exactly what information was taken.</p>
<p>Evil Corp. also launched attacks at Garmin, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/25/garmin-outage-ransomware-sources/">caused a nearly week-long outage</a> after a ransomware attack in 2020, as well as <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/insurance-giant-cna-hit-by-new-phoenix-cryptolocker-ransomware/">insurance giant CNA</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My co-founders and I have an early-stage startup. We’re having a really tough time recruiting engineering talent, but we’re open to hiring internationally. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Any suggestions on strategies and how to help our company stand out?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Flourishing Founder</strong></p>
<p>Dear Flourishing,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out! I recently invited <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bethscheer/">Beth Scheer</a>, head of talent at <a href="https://homebrew.co/">Homebrew Ventures</a>, for a chat on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/093-recruiting-with-beth-scheer/">podcast</a>. Scheer serves as an adviser to startup founders and executive teams on all things under the talent umbrella. She sees her job as “teaching founders to fish.” She shared her insights on recruiting talent, the importance of diversity and inclusion, and compensation:</p>
<p>“One of the things I say in my first meeting with, let’s say two co-founders,” Scheer said, “is until you raise your [Series] A, you will spend about 40% of your time on recruiting. And they’ll look at me and say, ‘Oh, that’s not so bad, that’s 20% each.’ And I say, ‘No, no, no, that’s 40% each person.’ And that’s when they realize how hard it is, and that’s always been the case no matter what type of [hiring] market. People underestimate how hard it is. And right now, in this market, it’s a lot harder.”</p>
<p>As you’ve discovered, competition, particularly for engineering talent, is extremely intense right now, with job candidates firmly in the driver’s seat. According to <a href="https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Updated-Employment-Data-for-Computer-Occupations-September-2021.NFAP-Policy-Brief.September-2021.pdf">an analysis</a> by the National Foundation for American Policy, there were more than 1.2 million unique active job vacancy postings in computer occupations in the United States as of September 6, 2021, up 15% from six months earlier.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Moreover, Scheer said the startups she works with are finding that nearly every candidate they make an offer to already has at least three other offers. That means you have to be strategic and deliberate on everything from clearly articulating your value proposition and mission statement to the makeup of your team to the benefits and compensation packages you offer.</p>
<p>As early as possible, early-stage companies need to be intentional about diversity, inclusion and equity whether the company has two male founders or two female founders.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The decision to name Zuckerberg is notable due to the fact that it could expose the Facebook founder to personal liability for the first time in a suit brought by a government entity in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;This lawsuit is about protecting the data of half of all District residents and tens of millions of people across the country,&#8221; Racine said. &#8220;We’ve taken our obligation to investigate wrongdoing very seriously — and Facebook should take its responsibility to protect users just as seriously.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Udemy's slowing revenue growth is not bullish for edtech valuations more broadly; the company's modest resulting revenue multiple is also somewhat beige.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online education company Udemy this morning set an initial IPO price range for its upcoming debut.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based edtech unicorn &#8212; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/udemy/company_financials">backed by</a> Learn Capital, Insight Partners and Norwest, among others &#8212; <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001607939/000119312521302492/d163445ds1a.htm">expects to price</a> its IPO between $27 and $29 per share. The company could be valued at more than $4 billion at the upper end of its price range. It&#8217;s a modest bump in worth for the company, which was last valued at $3.32 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/filing-online-learning-marketplace-udemy-is-raising-up-to-100m-at-a-3-32b-valuation/">during its $50 million November raise. </a></p>
<p>The pricing comes amid a busy year for edtech IPOs, which has included the public debut of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/">language learning company Duolingo</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/"> tutoring marketplace Nerdy,</a> <a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/powerschool-major-ed-tech-provider-valued-3-5-billion-following-initial-public-offering/">edtech software firm PowerSchool</a> and potentially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/quizlet-plans-for-ipo-over-a-year-after-hitting-unicorn-status/">even Quizlet. </a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig into where Udemy&#8217;s IPO price range puts its potential public value in detail, and then look at new preliminary numbers for its third quarter to see what they can tell us about edtech valuations more generally.</p>
<h2>Udemy&#8217;s possible IPO valuation</h2>
<p>Udemy is selling 14,500,000 shares in its IPO, with an additional 2,175,000 shares set aside for its underwriters, if they so desire to purchase them.</p>
<p>The company will have 139,602,466 shares outstanding, inclusive of its underwriters&#8217; option, when it is public. At its current $27 to $29 per-share IPO price range, Udemy would be worth $3.77 billion to $4.05 billion in its public offering.</p>
<p>Turning to fully diluted valuations, which include fully vested stock options that have yet to be exercised, for example, Udemy is worth more. IPO-watching group <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/87502/Online-education-marketplace-Udemy-sets-terms-for-$406-million-IPO">Renaissance Capital estimates</a> that at the company&#8217;s midpoint valuation &#8212; $28 per share &#8212; the edtech giant is worth $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>Quick math provides us with a fully diluted valuation at the <em>upper</em> end of the company&#8217;s price interval of $4.45 billion.</p>
<p>Each valuation is an improvement on the company&#8217;s final private valuation, set during a $50 million late-2020 Series F. At that juncture, the company was worth $3.25 billion, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/udemy-series-f--dafd7d75">per Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<h2>Does that pricing make sense?</h2>
<p>In its new S-1/A filing, Udemy detailed its financial performance through the first nine months of 2021, an upgrade from its first filing that only included data through Q2 of this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has been steadily rolling out updates to Facebook Groups aimed at giving admins better ways to manage and moderate their online communities. Recently, this has included a combination of product releases &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/facebook-rolls-out-new-tools-for-group-admins-including-automated-moderation-aids/">access to automated moderation aids</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/facebook-rolls-out-new-tools-for-group-admins-including-automated-moderation-aids/">alerts about heated debates</a> &#8212; as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/facebook-tries-to-clean-up-groups-with-new-policies/">new policies</a> aimed at keeping Groups in check. Today, Facebook says it&#8217;s introducing two other changes. It will now enforce stricter measures against Group members who break its rules and it will make some of its removals more transparent, with a new &#8220;Flagged by Facebook&#8221; feature.</p>
<p>Specifically, Facebook says it will begin to demote all Groups content from members who have broken Facebook&#8217;s Community Standards anywhere across its platform. In other words, bad actors on Facebook may see the content they share in Groups downranked, even if they haven&#8217;t violated any of that Groups&#8217; rules and policies.</p>
<p>By &#8220;demoting,&#8221; Facebook means it will show the content shared by these members lower in the News Feed. This is also called downranking and is an enforcement measure Facebook has used in the past to penalize content it wanted less of in News Feed &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/facebook-anti-clickbait/">clickbait</a>, spam or even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/29/facebook-news-feed-change/">posts from news organizations</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221027" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, Facebook says these demotions will get more severe as the members accrue more violations across Facebook. Because Facebook algorithms rank content in News Feed in a way that&#8217;s personalized to users, it could be difficult to track how well such demotions may or may not be working going forward.</p>
<p>Facebook also tells us the demotions currently only apply to the main News Feed, not the dedicated feed in the Groups tab where you can browse posts from your various Groups in one spot.</p>
<p>The company hopes this change will reduce members&#8217; ability to reach others and notes it joins existing Groups penalties for rule violations that include restricting users&#8217; ability to post, comment, add new members to a group or create new groups.</p>
<p>Another change is the launch of a new feature called &#8220;Flagged by Facebook.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2221103" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221103" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2221103" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Flagged-by-Facebook.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221103" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>This feature will show Group admins which content has been flagged for removal before it&#8217;s shown to their broader community. Admins can then choose to remove the content themselves or review the content to see if they agree with Facebook&#8217;s decision. If not, they can ask for a review by Facebook and provide additional feedback as to why they believe the content should remain. This could be helpful in the case of automated moderation errors. By allowing admins to step in and request reviews, they could potentially protect members ahead of an unnecessary strike and removal.</p>
<p>The feature joins an existing <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/new-tools-to-help-group-admins-manage-their-communities/">option to appeal</a> a takedown to the Group admins, when a post is found to violate Community Standards. Instead, it&#8217;s about giving admins a way to be more proactively involved in the process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Facebook, systems like this only work when Groups are actively moderated. That&#8217;s not always the case. Though Groups may have admins assigned, if they decide to stop using Facebook or managing the Group but don&#8217;t add another admin or moderator to take over, their Group can plunge into chaos &#8212; particularly if it&#8217;s larger. One group member of a sizable group with over 40,000 members told us their admin had not been active in the group since 2017. The members know this and some will take advantage of the lack of moderation to post anything they want at times.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how Facebook&#8217;s Groups infrastructure is still largely a work-in-progress. If a company was building a platform for private groups from scratch, policies and procedures &#8212; like how content removals work, or the penalty for rule-breaking, for instance &#8212; wouldn&#8217;t likely be years-later additions. They would be foundational elements. And yet, Facebook is just now rolling out what ought to have been established protocols for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/new-facebook-groups/">product that arrived</a> in 2010.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global shipping and freight industry has never been more in the spotlight, as the pandemic and other disruptions have led to enormous supply chain bottlenecks. While trucking logistics company Flock Freight can’t solve the global supply chain crisis, it could help get goods to their destinations faster and with less waste.</p>
<p>Less than a year after it closed its Series C, the company has raised a $215 million Series D round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, making it the industry’s most recent unicorn at a valuation of more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Flock Freight has developed a software-driven “shared truckload” service called FlockDirect &#8212; think of it as carpooling for shipping customers, letting them pool their goods and avoid terminals and hub transfers in the process. By using probability pricing algorithms, the company pools midsized freight from multiple shippers that are all heading in the same direction.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221053" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to the company, both customers and vehicle haulers benefit: customers by avoiding costs associated with repeated loading and unloading, as well as paying for trailer space they don’t actually need; and haulers by filling their trucks to capacity. Flock Freight offers additional savings through its “prebate” program, an incremental cost-savings program for freight that is less than 40 feet and 36,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The savings aren’t just monetary. Flock Freight says its tech reduces carbon emissions &#8212; as much as 40% &#8212; compared to the traditional hub-and-spoke shipping system. The company estimates that it has eliminated more than 15,000 tons of emissions to date.</p>
<p>The six-year-old startup is also aiming to use the funds to expand its operations and to hire, especially in Chicago, where it will open a new office this year.</p>
<p>SoftBank was an early investor in Flock Freight, leading its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/softbank-volvo-back-flock-freight-with-113-5m-to-help-shippers-share-the-load/">$113.5 million Series C last year</a>. In addition to the Japanese firm, this latest round also saw participation from new minority investor Susquehanna Private Equity Investments, as well as Eden Global Partners. Existing investors SignalFire, GLP Capital Partners and Alphabet’s venture fund GV also participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/amazon-news-app-now-has-free-local-news-coverage-in-158-cities-d7d56216ca72">announced</a> on Wednesday that its news app on Fire TV is expanding local coverage to 158 cities across the U.S. The app, which launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/amazon-is-rolling-out-a-news-aggregation-app-for-fire-tv-and-tablets/">last year</a>, is a customizable news aggregator preinstalled on all Fire TV streaming media players and smart TVs in the U.S. It initially rolled out in 12 cities and expanded to 88 cities earlier this year.</p>
<p>Today’s expansion includes cities like Charleston, Wichita, Tucson, Reno, Raleigh-Durham, Honolulu and Lincoln, and doubles the local stations available from 126 to 259. Amazon notes that Fire TV will automatically detect your local news station when you open the app.</p>
<p>When users launch the app for the time, they can select the news that they’re most interested in. From there, a custom playlist will be generated based on your selections. You can access local news for your city using the “Local News” tab within the Amazon news app or by saying “Alexa, play local news.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221044" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Amazon notes that the local news channels that are launching today are in addition to the national news channels already available on the app, such as ABC News, Bloomberg TV+, Black News Channel, CBS News, CBS Sports HQ, Court TV, Estrella News, People TV, USA Today and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">Twilio bought Segment</a> last year for a hefty $3.2 billion, you knew it was going to put it to work. Today at the company&#8217;s Signal customer conference, it announced a new omni-channel marketing tool, called Twilio Engage, built on top of Segment.</p>
<p>Segment CEO Peter Reinhardt says the new tool is designed to take advantage of several pieces of the Twilio product family, including Segment, to create an entirely new cloud marketing technology (martech) tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re launching today is Twilio Engage, a brand new growth automation platform, built natively on Segment as the customer data platform (CDP) and natively on Twilio&#8217;s communications APIs,&#8221; he said. The goal of the new application is to help marketers to understand their customers better and provide a way to deliver more customized messaging.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220930" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It starts by taking advantage of Segment, gathering customer info from more than 50 data sources. Next, the piece that really drives this tool is a new journey orchestration component, which lets marketers define a workflow for each set of customers. They can then write and deliver customized messages across the different communications channels, including email and SMS, which is where Twilio&#8217;s core communications APIs come into play, and they can also connect to a variety of external tools.</p>
<p>These different communications components can be delivered in the form of customized text messages, emails or ads when the journey workflow meets certain conditions or encounters certain triggers. &#8220;You can create an entire campaign now, soup-to-nuts, with all the content, all the audience creation, all the targeting inside of Twilio Engage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As an example, say a sneaker company has a running app. Using Twilio Engage, they could set up a campaign that begins when a user logs 100 miles in the company&#8217;s app. That milestone could trigger an SMS text with a congratulatory message (using Twilio&#8217;s Communications API). If the individual is also an existing customer, the system could automatically send an email congratulating them on reaching their first goal and include a 20% off coupon. If the user was not a customer, the company could re-target them across different ad channels &#8212; Facebook, Snapchat, Google &#8212; with a similar discount and message.</p>

<p>Daniel Newman, founder and principal analyst at Futurum Research, says that while the full plunge into martech is new, the company has had a foothold there with the CDP and its messaging platform, and he thinks it can leverage its developer community to make this move successfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the CDP and martech environments are highly competitive, I do believe that Twilio, and it’s loyal developer community, will be attracted to the company’s expanded offering as the aspirational goals of understanding your customer&#8217;s [full] journey continues to be a complex, yet increasingly possible goal for marketers and revenue leaders,&#8221; Newman said.</p>
<p>It is clear that Twilio wants to expand its platform and revenue opportunities beyond the core communications APIs on which the company was built. Reinhardt says that it became clear to him and Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson that the best use case for combining the two companies&#8217; tool sets involved marketing, and that&#8217;s why they are placing this bet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spoke with customers, and as we looked at how folks were using the messaging API&#8217;s on Twilio and how folks were using the data on the Segment side, it was really obvious that on both sides the [biggest use case] is marketing. And there&#8217;s a lot that we could do to make that easier and better,&#8221; he said. That resulted in them building Twilio Engage.</p>
<p>It will be going into pilot with select customers today and is expected to be generally available in the first half of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Microsoft announced Windows 11, it didn&#8217;t mention anything about how it wanted to annoy users with a less functional taskbar, but it did talk quite a bit about how its new operating system would feature support for Android apps. It quickly became clear, though, that the first version, which went out only a few weeks ago, wouldn&#8217;t actually support Android apps. Now, however, Microsoft &#8212; in <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/fe7771ac-f2df-42be-ac51-eb7fe0df1b5b/amazon-and-microsoft-announce-next-steps-for-bringing-the-amazon-appstore-to-windows-customers">partnership with Amazon</a> and its app store &#8212; is bringing a small subset of about 50 Android apps <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/20/introducing-android-apps-on-windows-11-to-windows-insiders/">to the Windows 11 Insider Program</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the beta build (not the dev build, because that&#8217;s on a different development cycle), you can now try apps like Amazon&#8217;s own Kindle app, The Washington Post app, Clash of Kings, Coin Master and Lego Duplo World.</p>
<p>All of this should work on AMD and Intel devices, with the apps running on what Microsoft calls the &#8220;Windows Subsystem for Android,&#8221; which itself is powered by Intel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-tech-unleashes-windows-experience.html#gs.dldf2i">Intel Bridge Technology</a>. It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft is using the Linux kernel and Android OS based on the open source version of Android 11. With that, it gets virtually all of Android&#8217;s capabilities, but not some of the apps and additional functionality that Google brings to its Android build. Since that&#8217;s pretty much also what Amazon does, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that apps from the Amazon Appstore should work well on the Windows subsystem, too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221003" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Your PC must have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#error-0x80370102-the-virtual-machine-could-not-be-started-because-a-required-feature-is-not-installed">virtualization enabled</a> and fulfill Microsoft&#8217;s overall requirements for running Windows 11, of course. You&#8217;ll also need an Amazon account to access the store.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221074" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221074" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2221074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2221074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Is any of this a game-changer? I don&#8217;t know. I have no issues reading the Washington Post on the web &#8212; and I think many parents would prefer it if their kids played Lego Duplo World on a cheap tablet anyway. If you play Clash of Kings or Coin Master, there are other questions you have to ask yourself first anyway.</p>
<p>Now if Microsoft would allow me to move my taskbar up to the top of the screen again, where it belongs, that would be nice, though.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has acquired London-based Sphere, which operates an eponymous groups chat app, the latest in a series of recent moves from the social network as it looks to aggressively broaden and improve its product offerings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sphere.me">Sphere</a> &#8212; founded by Tomas Halgas and Nick D’Aloisio, who previously founded news summary app Summly, which he famously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/17/summlys-nick-daloisio-on-yahoos-approach-to-ephemerality-and-its-startup-mentality/" target="_top" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold to Yahoo at the age of 17</a> for a <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130325/yahoo-paid-30-million-in-cash-for-18-months-of-young-summly-entrepreneurs-time/" target="_top" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> $30 million &#8212; did not disclose the financial details of the deal. The startup had reportedly raised <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/43a05ff4-45b0-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3">at least $30 million</a> &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/sphere/">$11.8 million in the first two rounds</a> that TechCrunch first reported.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson confirmed the Sphere acquisition news to TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221054" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Much like others, we’ve been watching and admiring Twitter’s growing investment in community-building with the release of Communities, Spaces, and features that promote safety,&#8221; Sphere <a href="https://blog.sphere.me/sphere-has-joined-twitter-e7127cfe0467">said in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we met the team, we were even more impressed by how seriously they are pursuing interest-based community and how much they believe in its potential impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sphere said as part of the move, which will see its headcount of about 20 join Twitter, the startup will be winding down the standalone app next month. The startup didn&#8217;t disclose the number of users or customers it had amassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been a long and exciting journey to this point. Like many startups, Sphere started with a very different mission — to help anyone find and share knowledge instantly through the creation of a &#8216;global brain.&#8217; We originally built a marketplace of paid experts from all around the world, connecting them through group chat,&#8221; the startup said in the blog post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we realised is that some of the most helpful and knowledgeable conversations came from groups where members felt a strong sense of belonging to one another. In other words, at the heart of our challenge was helping every single person find their community. The opportunity is massive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move comes as Twitter has visibly become more aggressive to expand its product offerings in recent quarters. The firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/twitter-said-to-have-held-acquisition-talks-with-clubhouse-on-potential-4b-deal/">attempted to acquire Clubhouse</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/twitter-spaces/">introduced a similar feature this year</a> and more recently has taken several steps to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/twitter-intense-tweet-warning-prompt/">curb unruly discourse</a> on its platform.</p>
<p>Hopefully with Sphere under its umbrella, the social giant will do something about the state of personal and group messages on its platform.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Truly effective customer service is rooted in empathy, because it’s people who reach other people, and customers crave that kind of authenticity in their interactions with brands.</p>
<p>A customer service representative sets the tone for how a customer will perceive and engage with the company going forward. The more diverse your people are, the more they can relate to a diverse customer base.</p>
<p>Companies that not only embrace — but champion — grassroots diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are typically well positioned to deliver outstanding customer and employee experiences at every level and touch point. In order to do so, businesses must first focus on creating and preserving a happy, safe and healthy company culture that stems from nurturing a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Companies that deliver the best customer experiences tap into empathy powered by the human element.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When working to fine-tune company culture, start from the bottom up. Don’t first dictate what the company’s culture will be and then create programs or initiatives around it. Instead, connect with employees from diverse backgrounds with varied perspectives and priorities to learn what they think and what differences they want to make in the workplace and in their communities.</p>
<p>From there, create the support, forums and opportunities for them to put forward solutions. But remember, program leaders should be careful to not assume or try to educate the masses, as social matters are localized by community.</p>
<p>Outlined below are four key ways to help diversity, equity and inclusion take root as core elements of your company’s culture:</p>
<h2>Start with an inclusive onboarding process</h2>
<p>Regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, appearance or ability, customer service teams must be provided with the training and tools needed for their own success. Not every representative’s onboarding experience should look or feel the same. Accordingly, you should design programs that take into account individual learning styles, physical accommodations and cultural considerations.</p>
<p>Navigate each training experience so they are flexible and nimble to widen the talent pool as well as minimize stressors associated with onboarding. For example, deploy microlearning tactics where millennial and Gen Z employees can learn in short and visual video clips rather than through traditional manuals or lecture formats. Or provide screen readers for employees who are visually impaired and noise-cancelling headphones for those with hearing challenges.</p>
<p>Also set clear intentions on the front end to welcome and absorb employee feedback throughout their tenure. This could include regularly scheduled check-ins with each customer service rep at every phase — day 1, 30, 60, 90, etc. — alongside a “confidence meter” to gauge how they’re feeling about their progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneur<a href="https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal"> Ankur Nagpal</a> spent seven years building up Teachable, a marketplace for teachers to make their online courses into full-fledged businesses. He raised only $12.5 million in funding before selling to Hotmart, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/edtech-notches-a-win-as-teachable-is-acquired-by-hotmart/">a deal reportedly worth a quarter-of-a-billion dollars</a>. Now, Nagpal wants to use his experience as a founder to help other founders scale their businesses.</p>
<p>Amid a proliferation of emerging fund managers, Nagpal’s “big pitch” is that founders want to take advice from people who feel like peers, are on their level and work at their speed. In other words, entrepreneurs want investments from people who have good vibes.</p>
<p>This ethos in mind, Nagpal announced today the official launch of <a href="https://vibe.vc/">Vibe Capital</a>, a $60 million fund to back pre-seed and seed startup founders working across all sectors, but especially those working on physical and mental health. The fund will raise another $10 million post-launch, from community and other LPs via the AngelList platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220988" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Yes, there are too many funds, and yes everyone is trying to start a fund, but that does mean that it’s more likely now that founders will find investors they get along with and can really connect with,” Nagpal said. He likened the trend to what he saw happening within Teachable, where the rise of more teachers led to more students connecting with their instructors.</p>
<p>Vibe Capital thinks it can differentiate from the steady drumbeat of new emerging fund manager funds by going out of its way to back talented founders. Literally.</p>
<p>Nagpal says that Vibe Capital will make roughly half of its investments in emerging markets, because there is a shortage of operator solo GP funds focused outside of the United States. Among its first 10 investments in the fund, Vibe Capital has companies in Portugal, Kenya, Zambia, Canada, Pakistan, India and Chile.</p>
<p>The international angle is one that is personal to the entrepreneur. Nagpal is a first-generation American who has lived all over the world. He plans to move, for three to four weeks, to geographies in which he plans to invest: in December he’s spending a month in India, in January he’s spending two months in Latin America and in the spring, he’ll find a new place to live.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A key investment area of Vibe Capital will be in the world of proactive wellness, further proven by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">rise of once-nascent hormonal health startups. </a></p>
<p>“Most healthcare dollars have traditionally been spent on sickness and when things go wrong. But we are entering a time where proactive wellness is finally coming of age,” Vibe Capital’s website reads. “We are extremely interested in businesses that proactively enable people to be their best physical and mental selves.”</p>
<p>Vibe is not Nagpal’s first foray into the world of investment. He debuted an <a href="https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal/status/1429783140961247232">$11.75 million fund</a> last spring before raising today’s chunk of cash. As the entrepreneur described in a Twitter thread, portfolio performance was well above expectations: 24 companies had a priced round mark-up, and another six had a substantial SAFE markup, leading to around 70% net internal rate of return (on paper).</p>
<p>Still, he admitted that he’s unsure how much of the growth is the portfolio, and how much is simply market conditions. The bizarreness of the market, and its impact on numbers, is a sentiment shared across any emerging fund manager operating today.</p>
<p>As a founder, Nagpal also joined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spearhead-launches-100m-fourth-fund-to-transform-founders-into-top-notch-vc-investors/">Spearhead</a>, a program created by AngelList’s Naval Ravikant and Accomplice’s Jeff Fagnan to help promising founders become investors. The program gives founders between $200,000 and $1 million investable capital and sets them up with legal entities to invest. Now, Spearhead is an investor in his fund. It’s proof, in some ways, that emerging fund managers can raise more than a micro-fund, and actually create an institutionally backed investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Limited partners in Vibe Capital include Bessemer Venture Partners, Tribe Capital and Foundation Capital, as well as individuals including GSV Managing Partner Deborah Quazzo, Andresseen Horowitz’s Andrew Chen, Better Tomorrow Ventures’ Sheel Mohnot, Gumroad founder Sahil Lavinigia and Sounding Board’s Christine Tao.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Department of Commerce has announced that it will ban the export of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/hacking/">hacking</a> tools to authoritarian governments in an effort to curb violations of human rights and other malicious cyber activities.</p>
<p>The rule, first reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/commerce-department-announces-new-rule-aimed-at-stemming-sale-of-hacking-tools-to-repressive-governments/2021/10/20/ecb56428-311b-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main">The Washington Post</a> and later confirmed by the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/10/commerce-tightens-export-controls-items-used-surveillance-private">Commerce Department</a>, will effectively ban the export or resale of hacking software and equipment to China, Russia and other countries of concern, for national security reasons, without a license from the department&#8217;s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).</p>
<p>The move comes after the Biden administration in March restricted the export of U.S. technologies — including advanced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a> and software that uses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/encryption/">encryption</a> for information security — to China and Russia as it continues to take a hard-line national security approach toward the two countries.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220950" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest sanctions are due to go into effect in 90 days and will cover software such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pegasus/">Pegasus</a>, spyware developed by Israeli firm NSO Group that several authoritarian governments have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">used to hack into the phones of their most vocal critics</a>, including journalists, activists, politicians and business executives.</p>
<p>Software intended for cyber defense purposes, on the other hand, is exempt from needing an export license, since the new rule won’t prevent U.S-based cybersecurity researchers from collaborating with colleagues overseas or disclosing flaws to software makers. When BIS first published a proposed rule in 2015, it received almost 300 comments that raised &#8220;substantial concerns&#8221; about the impact it would have on legitimate cybersecurity research and incident response activities.</p>
<p>The rule brings the U.S. in line with the 42 European nations and allies that are members of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which sets voluntary export control policies on military and dual-use technologies.</p>
<p>“The United States is committed to working with our multilateral partners to deter the spread of certain technologies that can be used for malicious activities that threaten cybersecurity and human rights,” said Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo. “The Commerce Department’s interim final rule imposing export controls on certain cybersecurity items is an appropriately tailored approach that protects America’s national security against malicious cyber actors while ensuring legitimate cybersecurity activities.”</p>
<p>The Commerce Department — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">which last year become one of the first victims of the Russia-linked SolarWinds hack</a> — is giving the public 45 days to comment on the rule, and is seeking comments on the potential cost of compliance and any impacts it could have on legitimate cybersecurity activities. The agency will have another 45 days to make changes before the rule becomes final.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what would be a blockbuster acquisition, PayPal is reportedly exploring the purchase of social media company Pinterest, according to </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/paypal-weighs-purchase-of-social-media-firm-pinterest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the publication, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Jose, California-based PayPal has “recently approached” Pinterest about a potential buyout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing an anonymous source, Bloomberg said PayPal could pay around $70 a share, which would value Pinterest at about $39 billion.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221000" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest declined to comment on the report. PayPal had not responded to requests for comment as of press time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest’s stock jumped by about 12% on the news, trading at just above $62 by midday Wednesday. That’s still down from a 52-week high of $89.90. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rumored purchase price would be in line with Pinterest’s current market cap of $40 billion. For its part, PayPal has a market cap of $308 billion.</span></p>
<p>Last month, PayPal announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an acquisition of Paidy</a>, a Japanese buy now, pay later (BNPL) service platform, for approximately $2.7 billion (300 billion yen), mostly in cash, to enhance its business in Japan. In November of 2019, PayPal announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to acquire</a> Honey Science Corporation, the makers of a deal-finding browser add-on and mobile application, for $4 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its plans to potentially acquire Pinterest make more sense than one might think at first glance.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months or so, Pinterest has made a concerted effort to expand into an e-commerce platform, launching several new features. In April 2020, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/pinterest-adds-new-shop-tabs-connected-to-in-stock-inventory-style-guides-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a new way to shop</a> on its platform, giving Pinterest users the ability to browse in-stock inventory from newly added “Shop” tabs on Search and on Pinterest boards. The company also improved visual search to make more products shoppable from Pins.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pinterest said it was rolling out new features for advertisers and brands to promote their products to users on its site. The launch marked the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/pinterest-rolls-out-new-shopping-features-for-advertisers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest initiative</a> to grow online shopping and advertising on its platform.</p>
<p>On October 14, Pinterest announced that co-founder Evan Sharp was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/pinterest-co-founder-evan-sharp-is-joining-jony-ives-design-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exiting his full-time role with the company,</a> where he had served as chief design &amp; creative officer, in order to join Jony Ive at his new creative collective, LoveFrom.
