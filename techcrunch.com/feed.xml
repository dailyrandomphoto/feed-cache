										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Reddit&#8217;s interest in sending some stocks soaring showing no sign of slowing down, the trading app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">Robinhood started restricting some transactions</a> Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Reddit wasn&#8217;t happy — and neither are some lawmakers. The incident apparently struck an unusual bipartisan chord, with Texas Republican Ted Cruz throwing his weight behind progressive Democrats who called out the company.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a blog post Thursday morning, <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/keeping-customers-informed-through-market-volatility">Robinhood said that it would restrict some transactions</a> &#8220;in light of recent volatility&#8221; including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. Robinhood will still allow anyone invested in those stocks to close their positions, but the move prevents retail investors from throwing their weight behind new stocks en masse.</p>
<p>Rep. Rashida Tlaib called Robinhood&#8217;s decision <a href="https://twitter.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1354807292667981828">&#8220;beyond absurd&#8221;</a> and suggested that the House Financial Services Committee hold a hearing on what she deemed &#8220;market manipulation&#8221; from the personal finance startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re blocking the ability to trade to protect Wall St. hedge funds, stealing millions of dollars from their users to protect people who&#8217;ve used the stock market as a casino for decades,&#8221; Tlaib said.</p>
<p>Her colleague Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — a member of that committee — chimed in with support for a hearing on Robinhood, calling the situation an &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; step to prevent retail investors from trading.</p>
<p>Seeing Cruz and Ocasio-Cortez line up on anything right now is unusual, to put it mildly. Earlier this month, Cruz called his enemy in the House a liar for <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1347236707138211845">demanding his resignation </a>after it came to light that the Texas Republican fundraised on false claims that the election was stolen as the attack on the Capitol took place.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Rep. Ro Khanna also flagged Robinhood&#8217;s decision to stop some trades, slamming the startup for freezing out small investors while powerful hedge funds scramble to get control of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re done letting hedge fund billionaires treat the stock market like their personal playground, then taking their ball home as soon as they lose,&#8221; Khanna said Thursday in a call for more regulation, citing the intensifying wealth disparity in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; This entire episode has demonstrated the power of technology to democratize access to American financial institutions, ultimately giving far more people a say in our economic structures,&#8221; Khanna said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The newly resurrected <a href="https://go.gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a> wants to realize its mobile dreams from the early-aughts in an augmented reality world, and they&#8217;ve raised some new funding to make it happen.</p>
<p>The AR startup tells TechCrunch that it has raised $4 million in seed funding co-led by Google&#8217;s venture arm GV and Spark Capital. Other investors include Niantic, Upside Partnership, Otherwise Fund, Capital Factory, Form Capital and a host of angels like April Underwood, Leah Culver, Jason Calacanis, John Lilly, Scott Belsky, Dennis Crowley, and Dave and Brit Morin at Offline Ventures.</p>
<p>Gowalla was originally founded back in 2009 as a Foursquare competitor, it gathered some early traction and excitement from investors, raising just over $10 million, before things petered out a couple years later and the team was acquihired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/12/gowalla-went-for-3m-in-facebook-shares-and-many-investors-were-cool-with-that/">by Facebook for $3 million</a>. Co-founder Josh Williams, who has brought back the app with new co-founder Patrick Piemonte, tells TechCrunch he hopes the new iteration can take inspiration from the social side of TikTok and the platform side of Roblox and allow users to &#8220;unlock&#8221; the world around them in augmented reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It&#8217;s still pretty unclear what the end game is thought it becomes a bit clearer as the app pushes out its early batch of beta testers &#8212; which the startup calls its &#8220;Street Team&#8221; &#8212; to find points of interest for the app. Williams contends there are some elements of the app that share similarities with Foursquare&#8217;s early iterations, with users getting credit for data they submit as well as badges for completing certain tasks.</p>

<p>&#8220;The questions that we ask ourselves is as stories is to a timeline, what’s the same equivalent to real world space and how do we create a gamified sharing format that has the same ubiquity,&#8221; Williams tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Gowalla team doesn&#8217;t have any firm dates lined up but hopes to share more about the eventual launch experience in the coming months and open up for beta in early summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity startup <a href="https://www.cybsafe.com/">CybSafe</a>, a ‘behavioral security’  platform, has raised $7.9 million in a Series A funding round led by <a href="https://iqcapital.vc/">IQ Capital</a> with participation from <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hannover-digital-investments-gmbh">Hanover Digital Investments</a> (HDI) GmbH and B8 Ventures. The investment round will be used to focus on expanding its enterprise and mid-market client base. CybSafe is a SaaS product with a per-user-based, subscription licensing model.</p>
<p>As most people in tech know, the big concern with security isn’t so much the system as the people. Indeed, 90% of UK data breaches are generally <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/90-data-breaches-human-error/">due to human error</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>CybSafe&#8217;s ‘behavior-led’ platform manages these people-related security risks using behavioral science and data analytics by delivering personalized cyber support for users. The company already has 350 clients in 15 countries, including Credit Suisse, Air Canada, HSBC and NHS Trusts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Launched in 2017, the company was founded by cyber resilience and intelligence expert, <a href="https://twitter.com/ozalashe?lang=en">Oz Alashe MBE</a>, a former Lieutenant Colonel in the British Army and UK Special Forces who was the first black officer to serve in the Parachute Regiment and UK Special Forces. The team includes former UK Government cybersecurity specialists, behavioral scientists, data scientists, and software engineers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2105528" style="width: 717px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105528" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CYBSAFE-action3-190402-VB.jpg" alt="CybSafe" width="707" height="393" class="size-full wp-image-2105528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CYBSAFE-action3-190402-VB.jpg 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CYBSAFE-action3-190402-VB.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CYBSAFE-action3-190402-VB.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CYBSAFE-action3-190402-VB.jpg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CYBSAFE-action3-190402-VB.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105528" class="wp-caption-text">CybSafe</p></div></p>
<p>Alashe says the platform helps users develop security skills and habits through “accredited microlearning content, adaptive support material, and personalized nudges. The combination of contextualized, just-in-time, and on-demand content ensures people get the help they need. They get it whenever they need it. And they get it in the way that is most likely to help them.” The platform is available in 9 different languages.</p>
<p>CybSafe is delivered via a mobile application or within a browser, showing ‘bite-sized’ guidance, alerts, and notifications.</p>
<p>CybSafe’s competitors include KnowBe4, Wombat Security and Infosec, but Alashe says CybSafe’s strength is that it addresses security awareness for the average person: “Security awareness is dead. It’s ineffective. It’s inefficient. And it’s broken. CybSafe uses behavioral science and data analysis to deliver security behavior interventions that work. It has efficacy rates of over 90% for some behaviors to prove it.”</p>
<p>The team includes Jonathan Webster, CTO who previously worked on Her Majesty’s Government Digital Services; Dr John Blythe, Head of Behavioural Science, and a Chartered Psychologist with the British Psychological Society.</p>

The past year was, of course, a major blow to an industry already suffering a slide. Hope that the arrival of 5G would right the ship were dashed by Covid-19.</p>
<p>Things are looking up, fueled in large part by a killer quarter for Apple. The company posted its earnings last night, putting much of its success at the feet of the iPhone 12. In spite (or perhaps because) of pandemic-fueled delays, the handset arrived in a perfect storm – the beginnings of a “supercycle” that see customers upgrading devices in a kind of critical mass.</p>

<p>Numbers are still down for the fourth quarter of 2020 – but they’re down by only 2% per the firm. That’s due in no small part to what amounted to the iPhone’s best quarter, as the company introduced four 5G-sporting handsets. Canalys shows a 4% increase for Apple, as the device arrived to a wider 5G rollout just in time for the holiday season.</p>
<p>The company snagged the global number one spot, with Samsung taking number two in spite of a 12% decline. Chinese manufacturers Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo rounded out the top five, all seeing double digit increases, y-o-y.</p>

<p>The category is expected to see a rebound this year, after suffering declines due first to supply chain concerns and then larger economic issues, stemming from the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The introduction of COVID-19 vaccines is also boosting business confidence for 2021, allowing them to plan and invest,” analyst Ben Stanton says of the figures. “Going forwards, there will be obvious economic ripple effects as government stimulus fades, and there are ongoing concerns around new virus strains. Overall though, sentiment in the industry is positive, and 2021 will see the smartphone market rebound after a 7% decline in 2020.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040 &#8212; removing emissions from all of its products and global operations or offsetting those emissions through carbon credits or carbon capture within the next two decades.</p>
<p>The company also committed to have a fully electric fleet of vehicles by 2035.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big step for a company whose products are responsible for a large percentage of the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change and comes on the heels <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/gm-ups-electric-and-autonomous-vehicle-spending-to-27-billion-through-2025/">of a pledge to launch a massive fleet of new electric vehicles and a $27 billion commitment to electrification</a> late last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The auto giant said that it would work with the Environmental Defense Fun on its vision for an all-electric future and will work toward eliminating tailpipe emissions from light-duty vehicles by 2035. Moving its portfolio, which today is dominated by internal combustion engine vehicles, will be a transition, a GM spokesperson told TechCrunch, adding that the main priority is to bring employees along in that shift.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s also getting into the charging business too. The company said it would work with &#8220;governments, partners, and suppliers around the world to build out the necessary charging infrastructure and encourage the use of renewable energy n electric vehicle charging.&#8221;</p>
<p>To power the company&#8217;s operations, GM said it will use only renewable energy power at its U.S. facilities by 2030 and by 2035 all of its operations worldwide will use renewable power.</p>
<p>These commitments are also going to extend to its supply chain over time as the company works with its suppliers to reduce their emissions, increase transparency and source sustainable materials.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;While electric vehicles do not produce tailpipe emissions, it is critical that the impact associated with production and charging is incorporated in our plans. By working with utility companies to provide access to more renewable energy sources, GM hopes to address the entire production cycle of future EVs, with benefits that will extend far beyond our own vehicles and operations,&#8221; the company&#8217;s chief executive Mary Barra said in a statement.</span></p>
<p>This commitment is going to require a massive transformation that encompasses more than GM alone, Barra wrote, because<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;making the transition to an EV is simply not possible right now – either because the appropriate vehicles do not exist or because access to charging is limited where [people] live and work.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.storetasker.com">Storetasker</a> is an online marketplace focused on connecting Shopify merchants with developers and other experts who can help grow their business.</p>
<p>The product is now owned by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/02/lorem-seed-funding/">the startup previously known as Lorem</a>. Co-founder and COO Charlie Fogarty explained that while Lorem originally had a broader mission of connecting small businesses and developers, &#8220;We realized that Shopify and e-commerce was by far our best customer segment &#8230; so we basically acquired our main competitor, Storetasker, and merged the two business&#8221; under the Storetasker name.</p>
<p>The acquisition (which included the Storetasker product and expert network, but not the team) actually took place last year, and Fogarty said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve spent the last 10 months basically rebuilding the product from the ground up. We&#8217;ve taken years of learning and combined it into a rebrand, a new product and a new end-to-end customer experience.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The core proposition is still the same, however. A Shopify merchant should be able to visit Storetasker, describe their project in simple terms and then within a few hours, Storetasker will match them up with one of the experts in the network, who they can work with directly.</p>
<p>Storetasker has already been used by more than 30,000 brands on Shopify, including Boll &amp; Branch, Chubbies, Aisle, Alpha Industries, Truff Hot Sauce and Branch Furniture. Fogarty said the average project size is just $300 and usually involves adding custom designs and unique features to a Shopify store.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2105489" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105489" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2105489" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?w=680" alt="Storetasker screenshot" width="680" height="373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg 2879w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=768,421 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=1536,843 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=2048,1124 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customer-app-2.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105489" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Storetasker</p></div></p>
<p>You could use a general marketplace like Upwork or Fiverr to find a freelance developer, but where Storetasker has conducted more than 5,000 interviews to vet its talent and picks the right expert for each customer, Fogarty said that on other platforms, &#8220;You have to sift through unvetted talent &#8230; The hiring burden is placed on the brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plus, he noted that brands can use Storetasker for more than development help — they also use it to find experts on conversion and &#8220;all the different aspects of e-commerce.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the new product, Storetasker is also announcing that it raised $3.2 million in Series A funding last year from Flybridge, Founder Collective, and FJ Labs.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Fogarty said he sees plenty of room to grow while remaining focused on the Shopify ecosystem. After all, there are <a href="https://news.shopify.com/now-powering-over-1-million-merchants-shopify-debuts-global-economic-impact-report-271485">more than 1 million stores on the platform</a>, with $200 billion in total sales to date.</p>

Today, the popular trading app Robinhood has become the No. 1 app overall on the App Store for the first time, followed by No. 2 Reddit, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/tech/reddit-wallstreetbets-private-gamestop/index.html">home to the</a> r/wallstreetbets forum which drove the push to buy GameStop.</p>
<p>Neither app had reached as high a chart position before, according to <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/reddits-wallstreetbets-thread-generates-strong-interest-in-retail-investing">data from Apptopia</a>.</p>

<p>The app store intelligence firm also found that Robinhood had its best day ever in terms of single-day downloads on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021 when 120,000 new users downloaded the stocks app for the first time across both iOS and Android. Robinhood also broke records for its highest number of daily active users on mobile at 2.6 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, online forum site Reddit broke its download record for its mobile app, with 199,000 single-day downloads on iOS and Android, Apptopia estimates, while also climbing to No. 2 on the Overall Top Charts on the U.S. App Store.</p>

<p>But the frenzy around GameStop and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">revenge of the retail trader</a> is boosting other, more traditional trading apps, as well. Apps like TD Ameritrade, Webull, Fidelity, and E*TRADE have benefited from the situation, with record-breaking daily users and higher chart rankings.</p>
<p>All four apps on Wednesday achieved their highest-ever chart position to date on the U.S. App Store, with Webull at No. 45 Overall, followed by TD Ameritrade at No. 53, E*TRADE at No. 113, and Fidelity at No. 178. (App Annie sees Webull closing Wednesday even higher &#8212; at No. 30 on iPhone. Before, it hadn&#8217;t even ranked in the top 100 free iPhone apps.)</p>
<p>Webull also recorded its highest number of daily active users yesterday, with 952,000, while TD Ameritrade saw a record 444,000 daily active users and Fidelity had a record of 429,000 Apptopia found.</p>
<p>Combined, the four apps saw 863,000 total downloads on Wednesday (Webull: 39K; TD Ameritrade: 24K; E*TRADE: 11K; and Fidelity: 12.3K).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how long the trading app mayhem will continue, as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/01/28/robinhood-stops-trading-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc-as-reddit-rally-begins-to-unravel/?sh=46dd2b926b75">Robinhood has already halted the trading</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">&#8220;meme stocks</a>&#8221; like GameStop, AMC Entertainment, BlackBerry, and Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Koss Corporation, Express, Nokia and Naked Brand.</p>
<p>That hasn&#8217;t sat well with Robinhood users, who are now in the processing of<a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1354803580713111553"> assailing the app</a> with 1-star reviews as a result, and <a href="https://twitter.com/HeelysBoi/status/1354794073333362691">encouraging others</a> to the do the same.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the Square-owned Cash App hadn&#8217;t yet gained from the GameStop insanity this week, Apptopia found. But it does appear to now be struggling as the Robinhood crowd began the search for another stock trading tool. This morning, Cash App&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp">Twitter account bio</a> reads it&#8217;s looking into an issue with Cash App that&#8217;s &#8220;delaying some orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>App Annie reports some slight movement today on Cash App,as it just jumped from No. 14 overall to No. 12.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/21/meet-facebooks-latest-fake/">long time in the making</a>, the FOB is part of Facebook&#8217;s crisis PR push to distance its business from the impact of controversial content moderation decisions &#8212; by creating a review body to handle a tiny fraction of the complaints its content takedowns attract. It started accepting submissions for review in October 2020 &#8212; and has faced criticism for being slow to get off the ground.</p>
<p><a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/165523235084273-announcing-the-oversight-board-s-first-case-decisions/">Announcing</a> the first decisions today, the FOB reveals it has chosen to uphold just one of the content moderation decisions made earlier by Facebook, overturning four of the tech giant&#8217;s decisions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ROy6FHGsCN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/facebooks-self-styled-oversight-board-selects-first-cases-most-dealing-with-hate-speech/">Facebook&#8217;s self-styled &#8216;oversight&#8217; board selects first cases, most dealing with hate speech</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s self-styled &#8216;oversight&#8217; board selects first cases, most dealing with hate speech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/facebooks-self-styled-oversight-board-selects-first-cases-most-dealing-with-hate-speech/embed/#?secret=ROy6FHGsCN" data-secret="ROy6FHGsCN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Decisions on the cases were made by five-member panels that contained at least one member from the region in question and a mix of genders, per the FOB. A majority of the full Board then had to review each panel&#8217;s findings to approve the decision before it could be issued.</p>
<p>The sole case where the Board has upheld Facebook&#8217;s decision to remove content is <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/436612660860568-oversight-board-upholds-facebook-decision-case-2020-003-fb-ua">case 2020-003-FB-UA</a> &#8212; where Facebook had removed a post under its Community Standard on Hate Speech which had used the Russian word “тазики” (“taziks”) to describe Azerbaijanis, who the user claimed have no history compared to Armenians.</p>
<p>In the four other cases the Board has overturned Facebook takedowns, rejecting earlier assessments made by the tech giant in relation to policies on hate speech, adult nudity, dangerous individuals/organizations, and violence and incitement. (You can read the outline of these cases on its <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/165523235084273-announcing-the-oversight-board-s-first-case-decisions/">website</a>.)</p>
<p>Each decision relates to a specific piece of content but the board has also issued nine policy recommendations.</p>
<p>These include suggestions that<span class="_8gv4 _8gv1 _OBTypography__text _8gv7"> Facebook [emphasis ours]:</span></p>
<ul class="_98m0 _98m1">
<li class="_98m5"><strong>Create a new Community Standard on health misinformation</strong>, consolidating and clarifying the existing rules in one place. This should define key terms such as “misinformation.”</li>
<li class="_98m5"><strong>Adopt less intrusive means of enforcing its health misinformation policies</strong> where the content does not reach Facebook’s threshold of imminent physical harm.</li>
<li class="_98m5"><strong>Increase transparency</strong> <strong>around how it moderates health misinformation</strong>, including publishing a transparency report on how the Community Standards have been enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This recommendation draws upon the public comments the Board received.</li>
<li class="_98m5"><strong>Ensure that users are always notified of the reasons for any enforcement of the Community Standards against them, including the specific rule Facebook is enforcing.</strong> (The Board made two identical policy recommendations on this front related to the cases it considered, also noting in relation to the second hate speech case that &#8220;Facebook’s lack of transparency left its decision open to the mistaken belief that the company removed the content because the user expressed a view it disagreed with&#8221;.)</li>
<li class="_98m5"><strong>Explain and provide examples of the application of key terms from the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy</strong>, including the meanings of “praise,” “support” and “representation.” The Community Standard should also better advise users on how to make their intent clear when discussing dangerous individuals or organizations.</li>
<li class="_98m5"><strong>Provide a public list of the organizations and individuals designated as ‘dangerous’ under the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations Community Standard</strong> or, at the very least, a list of examples.</li>
<li class="_98m5"><strong>Inform users when automated enforcement is used to moderate their content, ensure that users can appeal automated decisions to a human being in certain cases</strong>, and improve automated detection of images with text-overlay so that posts raising awareness of breast cancer symptoms are not wrongly flagged for review. Facebook should also improve its transparency reporting on its use of automated enforcement.</li>
<li class="_98m5"><strong>Revise Instagram’s Community Guidelines to specify that female nipples can be shown to raise breast cancer awareness</strong> and clarify that where there are inconsistencies between Instagram’s Community Guidelines and Facebook’s Community Standards, the latter take precedence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where it has overturned Facebook takedowns the board says it expects Facebook to restore the specific pieces of removed content within seven days.</p>
<p>In addition, the Board writes that Facebook will also &#8220;examine whether identical content with parallel context associated with the Board’s decisions should remain on its platform&#8221;. And says Facebook has 30 days to publicly respond to its policy recommendations.</p>
<p>So it will certainly be interesting to see how the tech giant responds to the laundry list of proposed policy tweaks &#8212; perhaps especially the recommendations for increased transparency (including the suggestion it inform users when content has been removed solely by its AIs) &#8212; and whether Facebook is happy to align entirely with the policy guidance issued by the self-regulatory vehicle (or not).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s controversial Oversight Board starts reviewing content moderation cases&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-oversight-board-controversy/embed/#?secret=Ye7do3l3Lp" data-secret="Ye7do3l3Lp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Facebook created the board&#8217;s structure and charter and appointed its members &#8212; but has encouraged the notion it&#8217;s &#8216;independent&#8217; from Facebook, even though it also funds FOB (indirectly, via a foundation it set up to administer the body).</p>
<p>And while the Board claims its review decisions are binding on Facebook there is no such requirement for Facebook to follow its policy recommendations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also notable that the FOB&#8217;s review efforts are entirely focused on takedowns &#8212; rather than on things Facebook chooses to host on its platform.</p>
<p>Given all that it&#8217;s impossible to quantify how much influence Facebook exerts on the Facebook Oversight Board&#8217;s decisions. And even if Facebook swallows all the aforementioned policy recommendations &#8212; or more likely puts out a PR line welcoming the FOB&#8217;s &#8216;thoughtful&#8217; contributions to a &#8216;complex area&#8217; and says it will &#8216;take them into account as it moves forward&#8217; &#8212; it&#8217;s doing so from a place where it has retained maximum control of content review by defining, shaping and funding the &#8216;oversight&#8217; involved.</p>
<p>tl;dr: An actual supreme court this is not.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the FOB will likely be most closely watched over a case it accepted recently &#8212; related to the Facebook&#8217;s indefinite suspension of former US president Donald Trump, after he incited a violent assault on the US capital earlier this month.</p>
<p>The board notes that it will be opening public comment on that case &#8220;shortly&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recent events in the United States and around the world have highlighted the enormous impact that content decisions taken by internet services have on human rights and free expression,&#8221; it writes, going on to add that: &#8220;The challenges and limitations of the existing approaches to moderating content draw attention to the value of independent oversight of the most consequential decisions by companies such as Facebook.&#8221;</p>
<p>But of course this &#8216;Oversight Board&#8217; is unable to be entirely independent of its founder, Facebook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://workday.com">Workday</a> started the work day with some big news today. It&#8217;s acquiring employee feedback platform <a href="http://www.peakon.com/">Peakon</a> for $700 million in cash.</p>
<p>One thing we have learned during the pandemic is that organizations need to find new ways to build stronger connections with their employees, and that&#8217;s precisely what Peakon provides. &#8220;Bringing Peakon into the Workday family will be very compelling to our customers &#8212; especially following an extraordinary past year that has magnified the importance of having a constant pulse on employee sentiment in order to keep people engaged and productive,&#8221; Workday co-founder and co-CEO Aneel Bhusri, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Without the ability to have face-to-face meetings with employees, managers have struggled throughout 2020 to understand how COVID, working from home and all the trials and tribulations of the last year have affected the workforce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But this ability to check the pulse of employees goes beyond this crisis period. Managers of large organizations know that the bigger and more spread out your firm becomes, the more challenging it is to understand what&#8217;s happening across the company. The company uses weekly surveys to ask specific questions about the organization. For them it&#8217;s all about getting good data, and so far customers have used the platform to ask over 153 million questions since inception six years ago.</p>
<p>Peakon CEO and co-founder Phil Chambers sees Workday as a logical partner. &#8220;Workday excels at helping enable customers to leverage their data. Together, we’ll be able to help drive greater productivity, talent development and employee retention for our customers — and unify how employees interact with their organizations,&#8221; he said in<a href="https://blog.workday.com/en-us/2021/workday-acquire-peakon-employee-engagement.html"> a Workday blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p>
<p>Peakon was founded in Copenhagen in 2014 and has raised $68 million along the way, according to Crunchbase data. Its most recent round was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/peakon-atomico/">a $35 million Series B in March 2019</a>. The deal is expected to close by the end of this quarter subject to typical regulatory review.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new type of neural network that&#8217;s capable of adapting its underlying behavior after the initial training phase could be the key to big improvements in situations where conditions can change quickly – like autonomous driving, controlling robots, or diagnosing medical conditions. These so-called <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/machine-learning-adapts-0128">&#8216;liquid&#8217; neural networks</a> were devised by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab&#8217;s Ramin Hasani and his team at CSAIL, and they have the potential to greatly expand the flexibility of AI technology after the training phase, when they&#8217;re engaged in the actual practical inference work done in the field.</p>
<p>Typically, after the training phase, during which neural network algorithms are provided with a large volume of relevant target data to hone their inference capabilities, and rewarded for correct responses in order to optimize performance, they&#8217;re essentially fixed. But Hasani&#8217;s team developed a means by which his &#8216;liquid&#8217; neural net can adapt the parameters for &#8216;success&#8217; over time in response to new information, which means that if a neural net tasked with perception on a self-driving car goes from clear skies into heavy snow, for instance, it&#8217;s better able to deal with the shift in circumstances and maintain a high level of performance.</p>
<p>The main difference in the method introduced by Hasani and his collaborators is that it focuses on time-series adaptability, meaning that rather than being built on training data that is essentially made up of a number of snapshots, or static moments fixed in time, the liquid networks inherently considers time series data – or sequences of images rather than isolated slices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Because of the way the system is designed, it&#8217;s actually also more open to observation and study by researchers, when compared to traditional neural networks. This kind of AI is typically referred to as a &#8216;black box,&#8217; because while those developing the algorithms know the inputs and the the criteria for determining and encouraging successful behavior, they can&#8217;t typically determine what exactly is going on within the neural networks that leads to success. This &#8216;liquid&#8217; model offers more transparency there, and it&#8217;s less costly when it comes to computing because it relies on fewer, but more sophisticated computing nodes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, performance results indicate that it&#8217;s better than other alternatives for accuracy in predicting the future values of known data sets. Th next step for Hasani and his team are to determine how best to make the system even better, and ready it for use in actual practical applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian startup <a href="https://www.shopalyst.com">Shopalyst</a> has officially launched a new platform that it calls the Discovery Commerce Cloud, which it says can help brands take full advantage of digital advertising.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Girish Ramachandra told me that Shopalyst was created to allow for &#8220;one seamless journey for the shopper&#8221; across advertising and e-commerce — something he said current systems are not currently designed to support.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s first product was a &#8220;universal buy button,&#8221; and Ramachandra said that has &#8220;naturally progressed&#8221; into a broader set of tools for cross-platform advertising, which Shopalyst has been beta testing for the past year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Discovery Commerce Cloud consists of five modules, which Ramachandra said work best together but can also be purchased separately. That includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a market intelligence product with information about what consumers are searching for and what&#8217;s popular on media and e-commerce platforms</li>
<li>an audience intelligence product to target ads based on audience interest, behavior and purchase intent</li>
<li>a Universal Ads Manager to deliver ads across Google Ads, DV360, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon Ads, Twitter and TikTok</li>
<li>a landing page builder that can support instant checkout on a brand&#8217;s own direct-to-consumer site, comparison shopping across e-commerce marketplaces, instant delivery or a physical store locator</li>
<li>real-time metrics that measure the full customer funnel</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2105435" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2105435" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2105435" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shopalyst_Header_V2__3-Ad-Builder.jpg?w=680" alt="Shopalyst header" width="680" height="457" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shopalyst_Header_V2__3-Ad-Builder.jpg 1160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shopalyst_Header_V2__3-Ad-Builder.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shopalyst_Header_V2__3-Ad-Builder.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shopalyst_Header_V2__3-Ad-Builder.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shopalyst_Header_V2__3-Ad-Builder.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Shopalyst_Header_V2__3-Ad-Builder.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2105435" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shopalyst</p></div></p>
<p>Ramachandra also noted that the ads created in the Universal Ads Builder optimized to each platform, with dynamically generated creative based on audience data. And by using the landing page builder, brands are also able to gather new data about the audience&#8217;s &#8220;shopping actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, [brands] didn’t have shopping actions, because retailers don’t share that data back with them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is all changed. Now they&#8217;re able to acquire first-party data [from Shopalyst], which will help them use the right advertising in future campaigns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shopalyst customers include Unilever, Nestle, Diageo, Nivea, L’Oreal and Estee Lauder. And while the startup was initially focused on its home market of India, the platform is now available across 30 countries.</p>
<p>Shopalyst also says that in beta testing, campaigns run through the Discovery Commerce Cloud have seen up to a 3X improvement in targeting relevance, a 5X increase in audience attention and an 8X increase in ad-activated shopping trips.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The venture potential of a startup that caters to individual students — instead of a slow-moving, small-pocketed institution — has a bullish aura that attracts investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add in a pandemic that forced many to embrace remote learning overnight, and it makes sense that we have seen companies like</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/outschool-newly-profitable-raises-a-45m-series-b-for-virtual-small-group-classes/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Outschool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ClassDojo turn first profits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while startups like</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/quizlet-valued-at-1-billion-as-it-raises-millions-during-a-global-pandemic/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Quizlet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/edtechs-newest-unicorn-applyboard-lands-1-4b-valuation-with-fresh-funding/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ApplyBoard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reached $1 billion valuations.</span></p>
<p>Last year brought a flurry of record-breaking venture capital to the sector. PitchBook data shows that edtech startups around the world raised $10.76 billion last year, compared to $4.7 billion in 2019. While reporting delays could change this total, VC dollars have more than doubled since the pandemic began. In the United States, edtech startups raised $1.78 billion in venture capital across 265 deals during 2020, compared to $1.32 billion the prior year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s survey, thirteen top edtech investors shared their thoughts on how growth of lifelong learning is reshaping the industry. Given the sudden extinction of snow days and yeast shortages brought on by student bakers in the early days of the pandemic, it&#8217;s easy to see how remote </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">education extends beyond traditional school hours. As learners become more multi-layered and nuanced, so have the edtech companies that back them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a recurring theme in today’s survey, signaling a shift in how investors approach hybrid learning. The evolution of post-pandemic education will be complex, if not aggressively competitive among the growing cohort of well-capitalized edtech companies. While we asked investors about their post-pandemic tastebuds</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/8-edtech-investors-talk-reskilling-digital-universities-isas-and-other-post-pandemic-trends/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">back in July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, much has changed since. Higher education didn’t combust like some expected today, and today, many predict that K-12 students will return to pre-COVID formats after vaccinations are widespread. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It puts startups in a difficult spot: if 2020 was about enabling video-based teaching, what might emerge from 2021? Integration between different edtech apps? New student collaboration tools? Are employer-led up-skilling and a renewed interest in self-improvement enlarging edtech&#8217;s TAM?</span></p>

<h2>Deborah Quazzo, managing partner, GSV Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What will edtech look like when students finally go back to school in person? Now that remote has become familiar, what are other concepts that you could see becoming popular?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For k12, use of digital products and platforms will now be very “normal” – companies like Lexia and Dreambox and Nearpod. Maybe this drives home usage of some products traditionally used only in schools like Lexia. Students of all ages are now very facile with zoom, this can pave the way for more zoom based synchronous learning offerings including extracurricular learning like music, dance etc. schools are now fully wired – maybe we will see schools implement home based learning programs – it’s where students spend half their time.</p>
<p><strong>What are the biggest hurdles ahead for early-stage edtech startups looking to scale? What opportunities are fading as the space matures?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Edtech cos need to stay away from the me too solutions. We have seen 20 creator led learning platforms across “preK to Gray” learning in addition to incumbents like Teachable and very few have an ability to build a moat in my view. Unless someone has a very fresh take, I think that ship has sailed. Hopefully as white spaces fill with competitors, new white spaces will emerge. Emerging tech – AI/NLP/ML/VR – will continue to push the envelope. We are still not driving enough people to competency whether in prek12, higher ed or workforce so the opportunity remains vast.</p>
<p><strong>How has edtech’s boom impacted your dealmaking? Has the new interest from generalist investors made valuations too bubbly, or is the market growth helping everyone?</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We met on zoom with over 800 founding teams in covid all over the world. We invested in 14 new companies and are just finishing rounds in 2 more. Valuation pressures are across tech sectors. Id argue that education still lags average tech. the question for edtech is whether there is potential for a $100B company in the sector – will TAMs support it.</p>
<h2>Ashley Bittner, founding partner, Firework Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What will edtech look like when students finally go back to school in person? Now that remote has become familiar, what are other concepts that you could see becoming popular?</strong></p>
<p>As it relates to our thesis, I believe that the role of employers is changing. Pre-COVID, it was estimated that as much as 1/3 of the US workforce would need to change jobs by 2030. Employers cite skills gaps as a top 3 business concern to stay competitive. Our thesis is that employers will take on more responsibility for reskilling their current workforce, and that training will become job-embeded (rather than only trying to hire to address the challenge.) Degreed was the first wave of this&#8230; Learn In is an example of the next step in this evolution. As employers look to provide more skills training (rather than compliance training), we believe that more will come from external sources (CEOs say they are unprepared to meet the reskilling challenge with existing internal resources) and that much of this training will be provided online and during work hours (to address the time barrier that is an equity issue.) I also see an opportunity for modalities like VR to become more popular as we shift to more digital and remote solutions (e.g TRANSFR.) Stats from McKinsey research.</p>
<p><strong>What are the biggest hurdles ahead for early-stage edtech startups looking to scale? What opportunities are fading as the space matures? </strong>In US pre-K and K-12, high customer fragmentation (16,000 school districts, 100K+ schools&#8230;pre-K even more fragmented with little public investment), long sales cycles, budget, pedagogy, and regulation. TAM. Relatively low consumer spend on education relative to other markets. Opportunities &#8211; increasing access to broadband, increase in device penetration. In FOW, increased recognition that reskilling and upskilling is a business imperative, company culture matters for competitiveness, increased focus on DEI.</p>
<h2>Jomayra Herrera, principal, Cowboy Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What will edtech look like when students finally go back to school in person? Now that remote has become familiar, what are other concepts that you could see becoming popular?</strong><br />
I think activities that are fundamentally better in person will go back to [being] in person (e.g., sports, music and other enrichment activities). I think that new technology educators may have adopted during the pandemic that they have found to be helpful to their instruction will remain but all the “nice to haves” will likely fall to the wayside. We have a thesis at Cowboy that supplemental education (e.g., Juni Learning, Reconstruction or Outschool) will likely stay online, because parents will not have to worry about driving their kids to learning centers and these companies have the opportunity to make the learning fun.<br />
<strong>What are the biggest hurdles ahead for early-stage edtech startups looking to scale? What opportunities are fading as the space matures?</strong><br />
For companies focused on K-12 students, it’s still really challenging to sell into schools and school districts because of the long sales cycle. This will likely become even harder, as local and state budgets tighten. In regard to what is fading, I think that tools that don’t solve a real need for educators, students and/or parents or don’t have demonstrated efficacy when it comes to student outcomes will start to fade. Consumers, especially after the pandemic, seem to be more aware of what technology has to offer and have lower tolerance for tools not having a demonstrable impact.For companies that are targeting adult learners, the biggest hurdle continues to be customer acquisition and building a brand that learners can actually trust. As the space starts to mature, consumers are getting more aware of the questions they should be asking (e.g., graduation and placement outcomes) and are less [fooled] by clever marketing.</p>
<p><strong>What do you expect education to look like in five-plus years from now, when the pandemic is more of a memory?</strong><br />
I hope that in this pandemic we’ve realized how critical our educators are to our children’s success and we pay them more :) Incentivizing our best talent to get into and stay in teaching is a critical lever we can pull to improve education.<br />
For K-12, I expect that there will be more comfort with technology in the classroom and that tech can be partnered with in-person instruction in a way that supercharges the educator with the data needed to personalize their instruction.<br />
For higher ed, I expect that there will be an acceleration in online learning for adults as they continue to look to reskill or upskill. There will be more opportunities to do self-paced online learning that is effective and affordable.</p>
<h2>John Danner, managing partner, Dunce Capital</h2>
<p><strong>What will edtech look like when students finally go back to school in person? Now that remote has become familiar, what are other concepts that you could see becoming popular?</strong></p>
<p>In K-12, education will probably continue to look much like it did, because the majority of parents are clear that child care is the principal value for their kids being at school. That said, a minority of parents are certainly rethinking education after witnessing what their children were actually learning every day for a year. My opinion is that we will continue to see a disaggregation of this care function from academics. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://johnwdanner.medium.com/the-future-of-schools-3247c6018b5">piece I wrote about that</a>, which has accelerated significantly this year.</p>
<p><strong>What are the biggest hurdles ahead for early-stage edtech startups looking to scale? What opportunities are fading as the space matures?</strong></p>
<p>For vocational schools with a &#8220;free until you get a job&#8221; model like Lambda or SV Academy, it&#8217;s all about job placement. Lambda has had a lot of success with their new fellowship model, which has allowed them to scale significantly. For a lot of early childhood and K-12 companies working online, it&#8217;s about new parent behaviors and whether you can develop a habit like Outschool has done. For senior learning like what <a href="http://getsetup.io/">GetSetUp</a> does, finding the reimbursement models through healthcare is probably the key.</p>
<p><strong>What do you expect education to look like in five-plus years from now, when the pandemic is more of a memory?</strong></p>
<p>I think we are in a transition to more and more academics happening in the cloud. Right now, that&#8217;s all about live experiences and human in the loop. In five years, I think we will begin seeing a significant impact of AI replacing many human functions.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buy now, pay later services &#8212; which let consumers finance the purchase of goods online by paying back the total in installments over time &#8212; have been growing in ubiquity this past year. Today, <a href="https://www.scalapay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalapay</a>, one of the companies that&#8217;s building a platform to enable buy now, pay later (BNPL) and related features, has raised a round to boost its position in the race for customers against competitors like Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm.</p>
<p>The Milan, Italy-based startup has picked up $48 million in funding, money that it will use to continue building the tech in its platform, scaling its service in Europe, and to begin working on efforts to break into the U.S.</p>
<p>The round was led by Fasanara Capital and also included Baleen Capital and Italian family office Ithaca Investments. This is the startup&#8217;s first significant funding since launching in 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Scalapay&#8217;s service is based around a basic model involving a quick sign-up, and then an agreement to repay the full amount in three equal installments, debited from your bank account or a credit card.</p>
<p>Like others such as Affirm, Scalapay does not charge consumers interest or other fees: its business model is based around taking a commission from the merchants on each transaction, the argument being that offering an easy and quick BNPL service will increase conversions and shopping cart size.</p>
<p>The startup currently has around 1,000 merchants in Europe using its service in France, Italy and Germany, including well-known, mulitnational European retailers like Decathlon, Calzedonia, Bata, Aosom and Bricobravo. It claims to be the biggest provider of BNPL services in its home country.</p>
<p>It also inked a recent partnership with banking &#8220;marketplace&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/06/raisin-acquires-mhb-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raisin Bank</a>, and through that, Scalapay will soon be able to offer its merchant customers the ability to offer BNPL services in any European country.</p>
<p>The plan will be to add on more originating countries, said CEO and co-founder Simone Mancini, as well as related payment features in areas like customer acquisition, conversion, retention and the back office tasks associated with taking and fulfilling and order.</p>
<p>For a start, on its own site, Scalapay lists merchants that offer its BNPL service, and the startup has found that these links are on average generating 1 million referrals each month. Mancini said the company is working on a way of building a product around this concept as part of its expansion.</p>
<p>There was a time when it was not that common to find installment-based payment options on sites, with BNPL a carryover from the world of brick and mortar where people might have in the past paid for items using layaway or other in-store finance options, in particular for more expensive items like televisions.</p>
<p>But the traction of older online services like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privately-held Klarna</a> (valued now at over $10 billion), as well as Affirm in the U.S. and Afterpay in Australia (both of which are publicly traded), have paved the way for more recent entrants like Scalapay (which was founded in 2019) and other newer players like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/alma-raises-59-4-million-for-its-klarna-like-payment-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alma</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8H5aMnT5ja"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/">Making sense of Klarna</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Making sense of Klarna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/embed/#?secret=8H5aMnT5ja" data-secret="8H5aMnT5ja" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>All of them have in part been lifted by the conditions that we are living under at the moment.</p>
<p>E-commerce usage has seen a huge surge of activity due to people staying away from physical stores (when those stores are even open) to help with social distancing. But at the same time, many consumers are in less financial stable situations as a result of the pandemic, so options to help them stretch out payments and remain more flexible with their money have grown in appeal.</p>
<p>This has also meant that the average price of the kinds of items that people are buying on installments is also changing. Mancini said the average sum people are paying on Scalapay currently is around €100. That underscores the value that people are not willing to pay up front, so from a microeconomics perspective it will be interesting to see how that figure rises or falls in the future.</p>
<p>The fact that the sums are not particularly high right now, meanwhile, might be one reason why Scalapay has seen some strong numbers in terms of defaults and approvals. Mancini said that &#8220;first purchase approval rates&#8221; are about 93% right now, higher or lower depending on the category. And its default rate is below 1.5%.</p>
<p>These are not bad, but also not markedly different from its competitors.</p>
<p>Going forward, the big challenges for a company like Scalapay, therefore, will not just the usual ones of building solid algorithms to ensure that they are not financing people who are likely to default on payments, making sure its system stays fraud-free, and so on. They will also include finding a way to distinguish itself from the rest of the pack of companies providing the same kinds of basic services.</p>
<p>Perhaps a small detail, but it&#8217;s notable to me that Scalapay&#8217;s site doesn&#8217;t look unlike Klarna&#8217;s. Both even lean heavily on pink as a color theme.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that Mancini moved to Italy from Australia (where his co-founder Johnny Mitrevski still lives and runs R&amp;D) to start Scalapay because Australia, he said, was going to be too hard to break into because of the dominance of Afterpay.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Australia is one of the most competitive markets, versus Italy being one of the most underdeveloped markets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was an easy pick, with heaps of opportunity here for BNPL.&#8221; The company&#8217;s focus on building more beyond basic BNPL should also help with building a profile and diversifying the business.</p>
<p>“I was impressed with the fast growth of the company and the underlying model,” said Francesco Filia, CEO of Fasanara Capital, in a statement. “They have shown resilience during a difficult period and I’m excited by where the company is headed.”</p>
<p>“Scalapay’s platform delights customers while driving dramatic results for merchants,” added Fang Li, Managing Partner of Baleen Capital, in a statement. “As a long-time investor in the BNPL industry, I have been beyond impressed by Scalapay’s team, execution, and product vision. I believe the company is on the way to building a valued and leading partner for European retailers.”</p>

Social media is awash with notes from individual Robinhood users indicating that <a href="https://twitter.com/rampcapitalllc/status/1354780260924063746?s=21">some popular securities are now untradable</a>, and the company <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1354699143172657152">reportedly sent out a note</a> yesterday saying that it is &#8220;implementing certain restrictions for for GME [GameStop] and AMC [the theater chain] options trading.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch has multiple emails in to the company asking for clarification regarding what trades, and securities are banned in aggregate, and the reasoning behind the move, but we&#8217;ve yet to hear back at time of publication. User commentary thus far concerning Robinhood&#8217;s choice has been swift, and negative, however.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Robinhood&#8217;s decision comes after zero-cost trading platforms found themselves at the center of one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">public market&#8217;s more bizarre sagas</a>, in which a horde of retail investors bid shares of heavily-shorted securities higher in an attempt to break the trades of professional investors; precisely who is making the bets, and what portion of the new wagers are from individual investors and not larger pools of capital following the trade is not clear.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after noting that some traditional online brokers had restricted some user access to certain securities, citing their volatility, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/how-trading-apps-are-responding-to-the-gamestop-fustercluck/">TechCrunch asked Robinhood</a> and a number of its peers if they were taking similar precautions.</p>

<p>One of the group added some protection, but most cited their focus on long-term shareholding over day trading; a fair position but one at odds with the fact that most free-trading apps generate revenue from consumer trade volume. And options and other more exotic trades generate more revenue for neo-brokers than trades executed in well-known stocks.</p>
<p>Robinhood&#8217;s latest move, then, will ding its revenues as it is no longer allowing for trading in some very popular securities and other market-based wagers.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that neo-brokers have come up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/amidst-robinhoods-planned-service-changes-a-tension-between-growth-and-safety/">against tension</a> between their business model and user access to exotic investments. After a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/business/robinhood-suicide-alex-kearns/index.html">Robinhood user committed suicide</a> after trading options and not understanding one of their trades, a tragedy, Robinhood worked to make options trading harder to get into. That was definitely the right call, but likely not great for its revenue in the short-term, we imagine, given how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/">lucrative those trades have historically proven for the company</a>.</p>
<p>Options volume is <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahPonczek/status/1354557324459962371">setting records</a>. Trading volume is at <a href="https://twitter.com/daniburgz/status/1354785931258114048">historical highs</a>. And at the time of writing, shares of GameStop are <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1354779669569155074">set to rally at the open yet again today</a>. Let&#8217;s see what happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last night, Qualtrics priced its IPO at $30 per share, selling 50.4 million shares in the process.</p>
<p>Notably, the company&#8217;s IPO price was harder to chase down than usual, with a formal press release in scarce supply. SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1747748/000162828021000932/qualtricss-1a4.htm?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link">filings</a> indicate that the company &#8220;anticipate[s]&#8221; a price of $30 per share, and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3655531-sap-qualtrics-ipo-prices-at-30-dollars-a-share-topping-expected-range-and-valuing-spinoff-at-some-15-billion-dollars">reports from media</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/IPOBoutique/status/1354609978447966217">IPO-watching entities</a> cite the $30 figure as well.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has an email into the Qualtrics team asking to confirm the reports, which are sufficiently widespread and confident that we&#8217;re similarly comfortable with its final price.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At $30 per share, Qualtrics priced its IPO at $1 per share above <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/qualtrics-raises-ipo-pricing-ahead-of-debut/">its raised IPO range</a> of $27 to $29 a share. TechCrunch anticipated that the company&#8217;s first IPO price interval <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/a-first-look-at-qualtrics-ipo-pricing/">was low</a>; and this publication noted that we would not &#8220;fall over in shock if Qualtrics priced a dollar or two above [its] raised range.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quelle surprise.</p>
<p>At $30 per share, and with 511,138,997 shares outstanding after its debut per its most recent S-1/A, inclusive of its underwriters&#8217; option, Qualtrics would be worth $15.3 billion. That&#8217;s just under double the $8 billion that the company was worth when it sold to SAP a few years ago. Of course, let&#8217;s wait until we get a formal, final share count before we lock in the company&#8217;s pre-trading value.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iy6gwVGvZp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/unpacking-qualtrics-brand-new-s-1-filing/">Unpacking Qualtrics&#8217; brand-new S-1 filing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Unpacking Qualtrics&#8217; brand-new S-1 filing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/unpacking-qualtrics-brand-new-s-1-filing/embed/#?secret=iy6gwVGvZp" data-secret="iy6gwVGvZp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For SAP, then, the deal is a win. But it&#8217;s not alone in enjoying quick returns on Qualtrics. Silver Lake agreed to buy &#8220;15,018,484 shares at $21.64 per share&#8221; and &#8220;225 million of shares at the initial public offering price&#8221; back in December. So that means that the company has a paper gain of more than $125 million on the shares it bought for just under $22 apiece.</p>
<p>Not a bad trade. If Qualtrics&#8217; gains in early trading, Silver Lake will do even better.</p>
<p>TechCrunch is talking to the company later today, and will have more notes on its performance and valuation when it begins to trade.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UCLA researchers have been awarded a $3.65 million grant to collect, contextualize, and digitally preserve a huge archive of materials relating to policing and mass incarceration. It should help historians and anthropologists, but more fundamentally it will thoroughly document a period that many would rather forget.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Archiving the Age of Mass incarceration&#8221; effort is being led by Kelly Lytle Hernandez, director of the university&#8217;s Bunche Center for African American Studies and creator of <a href="https://milliondollarhoods.pre.ss.ucla.edu/">Million Dollar Hoods</a>, another project documenting the human cost of incarceration in Los Angeles. The grant is provided by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may be at a turning point in American history — may be building something new,&#8221; Lytle Hernandez told me, citing a tumultuous but potentially transformative 2020. &#8220;If that&#8217;s the case we want to make sure we are preserving the record of what happened. What we want to do is retain the records, the memory, the experiences of people affected by mass incarceration, and where possible the records of the state, which would otherwise be destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The core of this collection will be a cache of documents released to Lytle Hernandez by the LAPD as part of <a href="https://www.aclusocal.org/en/press-releases/lapd-settles-lawsuit-access-its-public-records">this 2019 settlement</a> (shortly after she won a MacArthur fellowship) regarding public disclosures and communication. She described it as around 177 boxes of paper records from the 1980s to the early 2000s detailing the &#8220;war on drugs,&#8221; policing immigrants, and many other topics, with more to be provided later under an agreement with the department.</p>
<p>The idea would be to &#8220;counterbalance&#8221; these official documents, as she put it, with documentation and testimony from the other side of the equation.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who are disproportionately incarcerated or arrested — we often lose our records because we get evicted; because where we stored our records, we can&#8217;t make the payments and they&#8217;re seized; they&#8217;re seized when we&#8217;re arrested, etc.,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;If we need to undo generations of harm, we need to know, where did that harm happen? Who did it happen to? I see this archival project as part of that dismantlement effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the next few years Lytle Hernandez will lead the effort to assemble the archive, which will involve such traditional work as scanning and indexing paper documents, but also visiting communities and collecting &#8220;carceral ephemera&#8221; such as receipts for bail bonds (which may be the only surviving record of a person&#8217;s brush with the justice system) and personal stories and media.</p>

<p>Getting records from police and state agencies is a difficult and sometimes legally or politically fraught process. It&#8217;s important to get as much information as possible, from as many sources as possible, as quickly as possible, she said. Other major turning points in the history of racial justice have been inadequately documented, for reasons both negligent and deliberate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if the nation had sent out squads of oral historians and students to capture and preserve the record? Imagine what we could know about enslavement and its toll on all of us, what it meant to the making of this country, if we had talked to the people who had experienced it — what kind of archive that would have left us, to grapple with and to help us move away from its legacies,&#8221; said Lytle Hernandez. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve been able to forget the power and legacy of slavery because we didn&#8217;t do a good enough job. Same with native removal, internment, immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now there is an opportunity — around the country, she was careful to point out, not just in LA — to do just that with the era of mass incarceration. Not only that but they can bring modern techniques to bear in ways that weren&#8217;t possible during, say, the Civil Rights movement.</p>
<p>Her experience with Million Dollar Hood has shown her that there is serious interest in turning the tables among communities that have historically been disenfranchised or targeted by racist and classist policies propped up by bogus data.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we have a meeting we have black and brown students crammed into the room and out into the hall to learn data analysis and data science,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Part of the project is opening up that door. When you bring the people into the room who are the most impacted, they see that data differently — they see different stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>The archive will be completely public, though the exact scope of what documents will be included and how they will be sorted, described, and so on is still being worked out. Regardless of the exact details, the archive should prove invaluable to students, researchers, and a curious public over the coming decades as the changes Lytle Hernandez hopes for begin to get underway.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Jose-based robotics company Fetch unveiled its latest robot this morning. The PalletTransport1500 is an autonomous bot designed specifically to replace forklift uses in warehouses. The systems, which are designed to pick up and delivery pallets, are capable of sporting payloads of up to 2,504 pounds.</p>
<p>The device joins a number of different robotic forklift solutions from various companies, including Toyota. Though Amazon’s own Kiva Systems-produced robots are likely still the best-known pallet moving robotics in the game.</p>
<p>The system was developed with Honeywell’s Intelligrated’s Momentum warehouse software. Fetch, of course, already offers a number of different warehouse robotic solutions, building out a kind of autonomous ecosystem. The company’s systems are notable for their relative flexibility over other full-scale solutions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2101284" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Recording-2021-01-27-at-10.07.52-AM.2021-01-27-10_10_57.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="581" /></p>
<p>Per a press release, the new robot is designed to remove humans from the pallet-moving equation. Actions include,</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Cross-docking: the AMR can transport pallets directly from inbound to outbound shipment areas. After pallets are unloaded from the truck, the AMR carries pallets routed from the inbound trailers/containers directly to the respective outbound shipping area location.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Returns: once inbound items are sorted based on product type or vendor, the AMR transports pallets to their appropriate return station (inventory, recycle, charity, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Warehouse transport: after received products are unloaded and palletized, the AMR moves inventory to storage locations based on business needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This product category was no doubt one of its most highly demanded, given the fairly common occurance of forklift-related accidents. <a href="https://www.safetymanualosha.com/forklift-fatalities/">Per numbers from OSHA</a>, “forklifts cause about 85 fatal accidents per year; 34,900 accidents result in serious injury; and 61,800 are classified as non-serious.” That’s a pretty big source of workplace accidents. The agency adds if you assign one accident per machine, that means somewhere in the neighborhood or 11% of U.S. forklifts are involved in an accident.</p>
<p>In addition to these concerns, COVID-19 related shutdowns have no doubt made the move toward automated fulfillment systems all the more compelling over the past year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Apple and Google banned apps from sharing users' location data with X-Mode, a data broker with links to U.S. military contractors.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hundreds of Android apps, far more than previously disclosed, have sent granular user location data to X-Mode, a data broker known to sell location data to U.S. military contractors.</p>
<p>The apps include messaging apps, a free video and file converter, several dating sites, and religion and prayer apps — each accounting for tens of millions of downloads to date, according to new research.</p>
<p>Sean O&#8217;Brien, principal researcher at <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth?=01272020">ExpressVPN Digital Security Lab</a>, and Esther Onfroy, co-founder of the <a href="https://defensive-lab.agency/">Defensive Lab Agency</a>, found close to 200 Android apps that at some point over the past year contained X-Mode tracking code.</p>
<p>Some of the apps were still sending location data to X-Mode as recently as December when Apple and Google told developers to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-and-google-to-stop-x-mode-from-collecting-location-data-from-users-phones-11607549061">remove X-Mode from their apps</a> or face a ban from the app stores.</p>
<p>But weeks after the ban took effect, one popular U.S. transit map app that had been installed hundreds of thousands of times was still downloadable from Google Play even though it was still sending location data to X-Mode.</p>
<p>The new research, <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/investigation-xoth?=01272020">now published</a>, is believed to be the broadest review to date of apps that collaborate with X-Mode, one of dozens of companies in a multibillion-dollar industry that buys and sells access to the location data collected from ordinary phone apps, often for the purposes of serving targeted advertising.</p>
<p>But X-Mode has faced greater scrutiny for its connections to government work, amid fresh reports that U.S. intelligence <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/us/politics/dia-surveillance-data.html">bought access</a> to commercial location data to search for Americans&#8217; past movements without first obtaining a warrant.</p>
<p>X-Mode pays app developers to include its tracking code, known as a software development kit, or SDK, in exchange for collecting and handing over the user&#8217;s location data. Users opt-in to this tracking by accepting the app&#8217;s terms of use and privacy policies. But not all apps that use X-Mode disclose to their users that their location data may end up with the data broker or is sold to military contractors.</p>
<p>X-Mode&#8217;s ties to military contractors (and by extension the U.S. military) was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">first disclosed by Motherboard</a>, which first reported that a popular prayer app with more than 98 million downloads worldwide sent granular movement data to X-Mode.</p>
<p>In November, Motherboard found that another previously unreported Muslim prayer app called Qibla Compass sent data to X-Mode. O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s findings corroborate that and also point to several more Muslim-focused apps as containing X-Mode. By conducting network traffic analysis, Motherboard verified that at least three of those apps did at some point send location data to X-Mode, although none of the versions currently on Google Play do so. You can read Motherboard&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdkze/muslim-apps-location-data-military-xmode">full story here</a>.</p>
<p>X-Mode&#8217;s chief executive Josh Anton told CNN last year that the data broker tracks 25 million devices in the U.S., and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqm5x/us-military-location-data-xmode-locate-x">told Motherboard</a> its SDK had been used in about 400 apps.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Anton said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The ban on X-Mode&#8217;s SDK has broader ecosystem implications considering X-Mode collected similar mobile app data as most advertising SDKs. Apple and Google have set the precedent that they can determine private enterprises’ ability to collect and use mobile app data even when a majority of our publishers had secondary consent for the collection and use of location data.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve recently sent a letter to Apple and Google to understand how we can best resolve this issue together so that we can both continue to use location data to save lives and continue to power the tech communities&#8217; ability to build location-based products. We believe it&#8217;s important to ensure that Apple and Google hold X-Mode to the same standard they hold upon themselves when it comes to the collection and use of location data.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers also published new endpoints that apps using X-Mode&#8217;s SDK are <a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/trackers/354/">known to communicate with</a>, which O&#8217;Brien said he hoped would help others discover which apps are sending — or have historically sent — users&#8217; location data to X-Mode.</p>
<p>“We hope consumers can identify if they’re the target of one of these location trackers and, more importantly, demand that this spying end. We want researchers to build off of our findings in the public interest, helping to shine light on these threats to privacy, security, and rights,&#8221; said O&#8217;Brien.</p>
<p>TechCrunch analyzed the network traffic on about two-dozen of the most downloaded Android apps in the researchers&#8217; findings to look for apps that were communicating with any of the known X-Mode endpoints, and confirmed that several of the apps were at some point sending location data to X-Mode.</p>
<p>We also used the endpoints identified by the researchers to look for other popular apps that may have communicated with X-Mode.</p>
<p>At least one app identified by TechCrunch slipped through Google&#8217;s app store ban.</p>

(Image: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210126181021/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onezoneapps.nyc">New York Subway</a>, a popular app for navigating the New York City subway system that has been downloaded 250,000 times, according to data provided by Sensor Tower, was still listed in Google Play as of this week. But the app, which had not been updated since the app store bans were implemented, was still sending location data to X-Mode.</p>
<p>As soon as the app loads, a splash screen immediately asks for the user&#8217;s consent to send data to X-Mode for ads, analytics and market research, but the app did not mention X-Mode&#8217;s government work.</p>
<p>Desoline, the Israel-based app maker, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201127163851/desoline.com/privacy-policy-1">removed references to X-Mode</a> from its <a href="https://www.desoline.com/privacy-policy-1">privacy policy</a> a short while after we reached out. At the time of writing, the app has not returned to Google Play.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson confirmed the company removed the app from Google Play.</p>
<p>Using the researchers&#8217; list of apps, TechCrunch also found that previous versions of two highly popular apps, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jnj.mocospace.android">Moco</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fundevs.app.mediaconverter">Video MP3 Converter</a>, which account for more than 115 million downloads to date, are still sending user location data to X-Mode. That poses a privacy risk to users who install Android apps from outside Google Play, and those who are running older apps that are still sending data to X-Mode.</p>
<p>Neither app maker responded to a request for comment. Google would not say if it had removed any other apps for similar violations or what measures it would take, if any, to protect users running older app versions that are still sending location data to X-Mode.</p>
<p>None of the corresponding and namesake apps for Apple&#8217;s iOS that we tested appeared to communicate with X-Mode&#8217;s endpoints. When reached, Apple declined to say if it had blocked any apps after its ban went into effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sensors in smartphones provide rich data that can be exploited to limit our movements, our free expression, and our autonomy,&#8221; said O&#8217;Brien. &#8220;Location spying poses a serious threat to human rights because it peers into the most sensitive aspects of our lives and who we associate with.&#8221;</p>
<p>The newly published research is likely to bring fresh scrutiny to how ordinary smartphone apps are harvesting and selling vast amounts of personal data on millions of Americans, often without the user&#8217;s explicit consent.</p>
<p>Several federal agencies, including the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tax-agency-watchdog-investigating-irs-use-of-cellphone-location-data-11602014554">Internal Revenue Service</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/homeland-security-watchdog-to-probe-departments-use-of-phone-location-data-11606910402">Homeland Security</a>, are under investigation by government watchdogs for buying and using location data from various data brokers without first obtaining a warrant. Last week it emerged that intelligence analysts at the Defense Intelligence Agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/us/politics/dia-surveillance-data.html">buy access</a> to commercial databases of Americans&#8217; location data.</p>
<p>Critics say the government is exploiting a loophole <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/countless-advocates-and-companies-advise-supreme-court-to-protect-phone-location-data-under-the-4th-amendment/">in a 2018 Supreme Court ruling</a>, which stopped law enforcement from obtaining cell phone location data directly from the cell carriers without a warrant.</p>
<p>Now the government says it doesn&#8217;t believe it needs a warrant for what it can buy directly from brokers.</p>
<p>Sen. Ron Wyden, a vocal privacy critic whose office has been investigating the data broker industry, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2637/all-info">previously drafted legislation</a> that would grant the Federal Trade Commission new powers to regulate and fine data brokers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans are sick of learning that their location data is being sold by data brokers to anyone with a credit card. Industry self-regulation clearly isn&#8217;t working — Congress needs to pass tough legislation, like my Mind Your Own Business Act, to give consumers effective tools to prevent their data being sold and to give the FTC the power to hold companies accountable when they violate Americans&#8217; privacy,&#8221; said Wyden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boxed, the New York-based online retailer that sells and delivers bulk-sized groceries, makes its foray into Asia by partnering with Aeon, one of Asia&#8217;s largest brick-and-mortar retail operators.</p>
<p>Unlike its consumer-focused business in the U.S., which has been described as &#8220;Costco for millennials,&#8221; Boxed is exporting its nascent software-as-a-service solution to Aeon in Malaysia. As part of the tie-up, the American startup will create an end-to-end e-commerce solution to aid Aeon&#8217;s digital transformation, which includes a storefront platform and inventory-picking software. Boxed declined to disclose the value of the deal but said it&#8217;s in the &#8220;several tens of millions of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malaysia, which is home to more than 30 million people, is Boxed&#8217;s first stop in Asia and Aeon&#8217;s biggest market outside its home base of Japan. Aeon employs some 10,000 staff in Malaysia, where it has pledged to spur local employment amid the pandemic through its virtual mall.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Boxed&#8217;s technology, Aeon customers will have the flexibility to pick their chosen number of items and have them shipped in a box to their doorstep. Boxed doesn&#8217;t intend to provide last-mile delivery in Asia but will instead tap local courier services. Grab, for instance, is a potential partner, Boxed co-founder and CEO Chieh Huang told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<h2>Foray into Asia</h2>
<p>Through a mutual friend, Huang got in touch with Aeon, which was established 263 years ago in Japan and today operates 21,000 locations, from clothing chains, convenience stores to general merchandise stores, across 14 countries.</p>
<p>Working with Aeon was challenging at first, Huang said, as there were differences not only in time zones but also in cultural norms due to Aeon&#8217;s colossal size. It took numerous in-person meetings and international calls to eventually bridge the gap.</p>
<p>The partners are also exploring opportunities to work together in other Southeast Asian markets. Boxed will keep its enterprise-facing angle by licensing software to local retailers rather than expanding its consumer business to the region, which is already crowded with established e-commerce players like Shopee, Lazada and Tokopedia.</p>
<h2>Digitizing traditional retailers</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2101116" style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101116" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2101116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aeon.jpg" alt="" width="670" height="309" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aeon.jpg 677w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aeon.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aeon.jpg?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aeon.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101116" class="wp-caption-text">An Aeon mall / Source: Aeon</p></div></p>
<p>Prior to the SaaS deal, Aeon was already an investor in Boxed. In 2018, it led the e-commerce startup&#8217;s <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/08/21/1554589/0/en/Boxed-Raises-Series-D-Funding-Round.html">$111 billion Series D funding round</a> so it could tap Boxed&#8217;s intel in retail digitization. Huang believed his company was chosen because it was one of the few e-commerce operators alongside JD.com and Amazon that have full control over the supply chain and users&#8217; purchasing experience.</p>
<p>Boxed builds its own warehouse robots as well because &#8220;we are able to do it much cheaper ourselves than buying the robots,&#8221; argued Huang. &#8220;Most of the robots are very advanced because they are not able to control the environment. We own the fulfillment center so we can delete a lot of the things that are expensive, such as Lidar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the startup&#8217;s &#8220;box&#8221; model helps flat out the costs of shipping with each incremental item delivered, giving the platform a price advantage, the founder said.</p>
<h2>Future of Boxed</h2>
<p>Founded in 2013, Boxed has accumulated over seven million registered users. With a staff of 500 employees across the U.S., it&#8217;s now generating hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue.</p>
<p>In all, Boxed has raised over $270 million. Since its last financing round in 2018, the company has had little publicity. During that time Boxed was focused on fine-tuning its retail software solution, which has become its second and more profitable line of business. The firm&#8217;s margin is improving every year and getting close to profitability in 2021, said Huang. And like other e-commerce companies, Boxed saw growth in user demand through the pandemic.</p>
<p>Going public is &#8220;always on our mind,&#8221; said Huang. &#8220;I think it will surprise a lot of people how close we are to profitability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boxed-m-a-exclusive/exclusive-online-retailer-boxed-explores-1-billion-sale-sources-idUKKBN25S57H?edition-redirect=uk">reported</a> in September that Boxed was weighing up &#8220;a sale or going public through a merger with a blank-check acquisition company that could value it at around $1 billion.&#8221; To that, the startup gave a somewhat indefinite response:</p>
<p>&#8220;As a result of the shift to online, we’ve also seen increased demand from many parties looking to partner with us to accelerate growth both in our marketplace and new SaaS business. We are thoughtfully considering these options when it comes to the long-term success of Boxed.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we move deeper into a cloud-centric world, everything was supposed to get easier, but in truth there&#8217;s a lot of moving parts, and companies need help getting everything to work. This takes people with a particular set of skills to help clients with tasks like integrations, managing hybrid and multi-cloud environments and getting data where you need it.</p>
<p><a href="https://tercera.io/">Tercera</a>, a new venture capital firm launching today wants to attack this problem by investing in companies that can act as helpers and consultants. In a world where venture capital tends to gravitate mostly towards software and hardware, this is a distinctly different investment thesis.</p>
<p>Chris Barbin, founder and CEO at Tercera knows quite a bit about this. He was one of the founders at <a href="https://appirio.com/">Appirio</a>, a consulting firm founded way back in 2006 when cloud computing as we know it today was just getting off the ground. His former company had the vision and the foresight to start a firm to help companies use new tools like Salesforce, Google, Workday and AWS. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/indias-wipro-buys-cloud-services-consultancy-appirio-for-500m/">Wipro bought the company</a> in 2016 for $500 million after it had raised over $117 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Barbin believes that today, the level of complexity has only increased, and there will be a growing need for what he calls this people power to make everything work, and that takes a specialized kind of investor. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a flurry of investment activity into professional services-based companies over the last couple of years, but there&#8217;s never been an investment firm that is exclusively focused on these types of businesses,&#8221; Barbin explained.</p>
<p>During the firm&#8217;s research phase, the founders identified key platform companies like Salesforce, Twilio, Snowflake, DataDog and Cloudflare, and they estimate that there are between 7500 and 10,000 consulting companies supporting companies like this. &#8220;The goal of the firm is to help create a kind of a powerhouse for those emerging [platforms], or a firm or two that actually has the collection of those [SaaS platforms] in their toolkit,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company will be targeting established firms with revenue between $5 and $20 million with aspirations to grow into the hundreds of millions, and will be doling out investments of between $5 and 20 million of capital per bet.</p>
<p>The firm is just getting started, but plans to have 8 employees by mid-year. Barbin indicated at least one investment was already in the pipeline, but wasn&#8217;t ready to give details just yet.</p>
