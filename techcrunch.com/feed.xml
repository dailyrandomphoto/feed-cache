										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today officially unveiled AirTag, its location tracking beacons that can help Apple device owners find lost items through Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; application. The AirTags themselves are small, rounded tracking devices that can be attached to personal items, like purses, bags or keys. Pre-orders start this Friday, and the product goes on sale April 30th, for $30. A pack of three runs $99.</p>
<p>The item tracking uses the company&#8217;s proprietary U1 ultra-wideband chip for what it calls &#8220;Precision Tracking.&#8221; This will work with Apple&#8217;s newer iPhones (iPhone 11, 11 Pro and the newer iPhones 12 devices).</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">assets</a> found in Apple&#8217;s code referencing the new product last year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">a mistake in an official Apple YouTube video</a>, AirTags had also been brought up as an example of Apple&#8217;s anticompetitive behavior before U.S. regulators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, for example, Tile <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-apple-tile/tile-says-apples-behavior-is-anticompetitive-and-has-gotten-worse-not-better-idUSKBN21J72V?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29">spoke about AirTags before a panel</a> of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, saying that Apple&#8217;s decision to launch its own version of the lost-item finder gave Apple&#8217;s new product a first-party advantage over its competitors. Apple&#8217;s devices, Tile explained, would be able operate in the background without having to continually popping up requests asking users to agree to background tracking, like Tile&#8217;s app has to do. Apple&#8217;s devices would also be integrated with &#8220;Find My,&#8221; but other tags would not be.</p>
<p>Following the regulatory scrutiny, Apple at its developer conference WWDC in June said<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"> it would extend &#8220;Find My&#8221;</a> to third-party companies. However, a report by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/24/apple-find-my-competition/">The Washington Post</a> indicated that olive branch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/25/this-week-in-apps-apple-argues-for-commissions-find-my-nda-alexa-to-open-apps/">may not have been what it seemed</a> &#8212; companies would have to sign an NDA and said Apple customers would be barred from using competing devices simultaneously.</p>
<p>Ahead of today&#8217;s event, Apple announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">the launch of its Find My Network Accessory program</a>, which officially opened the doors to third-party manufacturers who wanted access to the Find My app. Early adopters included VanMoof’s S3 and X3 e-bikes, Belkin’s SOUNDFORM Freedom True Wireless Earbuds, and an AirTags competitor, the Chipolo ONE Spot &#8212; but not Tile. We understand Tile doesn&#8217;t want to participate in Find My because it has a direct relationship with customers through its own iOS app that it doesn&#8217;t want to give up.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s entry in this &#8220;lost item finder&#8221; space means competitors, like Tile, will have more serious competition even with the concessions Apple has made with the opening up of &#8220;Find My.&#8221; Tile so far has responded to Apple&#8217;s plans by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">pre-announcing its plans to launch its own UWB-powered tracker</a>, arriving this year. Apple&#8217;s tight hold over its ecosystem benefits its launch of new products, like AirTags, forcing Tile to focus on touting its advantages, like its wider variety of form factors and cross-platform support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of increased competition from Spotify, Apple today announced its own expansion into podcast subscriptions. At the company&#8217;s spring event this afternoon, Apple unveiled its plans for a podcasts subscription service which would allow listeners to unlock &#8220;additional benefits,&#8221; like ad-free listening, early access to episodes and the ability to support favorite creators. The service will be available as part of Apple&#8217;s newly updated Podcasts app where free podcasts are also found.</p>
<p>The announcement of the new service follows shortly after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/">an industry report suggested</a> that Spotify&#8217;s podcast listeners would top Apple&#8217;s for the first time in 2021.</p>
<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook briefly introduced the subscription at the launch of today&#8217;s event, noting that this was &#8220;the biggest change to Apple Podcasts since its debut.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t get into the details around pricing or functionality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cook also noted the Apple Podcasts app had been updated, with newly redesigned show and episode pages that make it easier to listen, follow and share podcasts. The app will also include a new &#8220;Channels&#8221; feature that lets you find shows from favorite creators and get recommendations.</p>

<p>Apple said the new service will be available in May to listeners in more than 170 countries and regions.</p>
<p>In a press release, Apple said the first premium subscriptions would come from both &#8220;independent voices and premier studios,&#8221; including Tenderfoot TV, Pushkin Industries, Radiotopia from PRX, and QCODE, as well as larger brands like NPR, the Los Angeles Times, The Athletic, Sony Music Entertainment, and others.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s plans for a podcast subscription service was previously scooped by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-spring-event-expected-to-reveal-latest-ipad-pro-subscription-podcasts-11618911002?page=1">The Wall St. Journal</a>, which said the company was preparing to add a paid subscription option to its product, as well as by Vox Media’s <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_161893061758410&amp;key=c1c7d488bb2df8a8b659d5d41634d304&amp;libId=knq4nliq010023dg000DL3p0gc3luw2cs&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2021%2F04%2F19%2Freport-premium-podcasts-subscription-service-to-be-announced-at-the-apple-event%2F&amp;v=1&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fpkafka%2Fstatus%2F1383878437119479811&amp;title=Report%3A%20Premium%20podcasts%20subscription%20service%20to%20be%20announced%20at%20the%20Apple%20event%20-%209to5Mac&amp;txt=podcast%20subscription%20service">Peter Kafka</a>, who said he believed Apple would introduce a paywalled podcast subscription product at today&#8217;s event. There were also hints found in the iOS 14.5 beta, which showed a redesigned Podcasts app featuring an account button on the Listen Now tab. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/apple-may-announce-podcasts-service-at-event/">MacRumors</a> had reported that show notifications had been relocated here, and suggested that managing paid subscriptions may also be found in this new area in the future.</p>
<p>The move to enter the subscription podcast space follows years of significant investment by the Apple Podcasts and Apple Music competitor, Spotify, also a chief Apple critic.</p>
<p>Spotify in February noted it had <a href="https://www.axios.com/spotify-podcasts-number-6c06a71f-6548-4f03-b7e1-5c9e71814f62.html">tripled</a> the number of podcasts on its platform, year-over-year, to 2.2 million. It has also forged a variety of exclusive deals over the years with big names like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/spotify-signs-the-joe-rogan-experience-to-an-exclusive-multi-year-deal/">Joe Rogan</a>, Kim Kardashian, DC Comics, Michelle Obama and The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, among others. And it has acquired podcast startups, ad tech and studios, including hosting and ad company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">Megaphone</a>, creation tools from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">Anchor</a>, content producers like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">Gimlet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/spotify-is-buying-the-ringer-to-boost-its-sports-podcast-content/">The Ringer,</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/spotify-acquires-true-crime-studio-parcast-to-expand-its-original-podcast-content/">Parcast.</a></p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/spotify-signs-the-joe-rogan-experience-to-an-exclusive-multi-year-deal/">Spotify announced plans for its own podcast subscriptions</a> via an Anchor feature and invested in live audio through its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">acquisition of live chat app Locker Room</a> by Betty Labs. Spotify had said it would share subscription revenue with podcast creators, who would keep the majority of their earnings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/as-crypto-comes-back-binance-backed-injective-protocol-launches-testnet-for-its-defi-trading-platform/">December</a> last year <a href="https://injectiveprotocol.com/">Injective Protocol</a>, launched the testnet for its DeFi protocols for cross-chain derivatives trading, with  backing from giant crypto exchange Binance. It has now raised $10 million in a “party&#8221; funding round. Participating in the round was Pantera Capital, BlockTower, Hashed, Cadenza Ventures (formerly BitMex Ventures), CMS, and QCP Capital. Billionaire NBA team owner and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1362427956107345924?s=21">has also</a> made a strategic investment into Injective, according to my sources.</p>
<p>Injective’s main competitors (centralized and decentralized exchanges) include CME Group, BitMEX, LedgerX and OKEx, among others. The advantage of the approach used by Injective (it says) combines the advantages of decentralized exchanges: resistance to front running, scams, and hacks, with the speed, low transaction fees, and no gas fees associated with centralized platforms. Developers can also create their own derivatives and markets to trade.</p>
<p>Eric Chen, CEO of Injective Protocol said in a statement: “Legacy institutions and practices create a number of artificial delays and middlemen that prevent innovation in the financial markets ecosystem. At Injective, our goal is to enable an unparalleled decentralized trading experience, whereby retail traders globally can for the first time access limitless markets without the typical predatory fees and slow transaction times”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The background to this is that Injective is essentially trying to build a decentralized competitor to Robinhood, because their platform allows the creation of synthetic tokens that represent stock in public companies like Apple and indices like S&amp;P 500. This means meaning trading can happen 24/7 with instant finalization, as DeFi promises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do I invest in Injective: the whole stop out because of the capital requirements, Robinhood didn’t do it on purpose to hurt traders, they just didn’t have enough equity and they would have gone bankrupt because they had too many customers. But if you’re doing it in a decentralized manner every investor gets to see how much Injective has of all of this, there’s no hiding it and that creates an opportunity&#8221;, said Mark Cuban on his investment in Injective.</p>
<p>The potential here is that brokers wouldn’t be able to block trades on certain stocks, as they did with GameStop, as pointed out by Cuban above.</p>
<p>Injective’s team is drawn from Stanford University, came up with its project in 2018, and Chen was working at hedge funds and worked in cryptographic research at a blockchain-focused fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is now the default business model for most B2B and B2C software startups. And while it&#8217;s been around for a while now, its momentum keeps accelerating and the ecosystem continues to expand as technologists and marketers are getting more sophisticated about how to build and sell SaaS products. For all of them, we&#8217;re pleased to announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=launchpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=launchpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>, a one-day virtual event that will examine the state of SaaS to help startup founders, developers and investors understand the state of play and what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>The single-day event will take place 100% virtually on October 27 and will feature actionable advice, Q&amp;A with some of SaaS&#8217;s biggest names, and plenty of networking opportunities. $75 Early Bird Passes are now on sale. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=launchpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=launchpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Book your passes today to save $100 before prices go up</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not quite ready to disclose our agenda yet, but you can expect a mix of superstars from across the industry, ranging from some of the largest tech companies to up-and-coming startups that are pushing the limits of SaaS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The plan is to look at a broad spectrum of what&#8217;s happening in with B2B startups and give you actionable insights into how to build and/or improve your own product. If you&#8217;re just getting started, we want you to come away with new ideas for how to start your company and if you&#8217;re already on your way, then our sessions on scaling both your technology and marketing organization will help you to get to that $100 million annual run rate faster.</p>
<p>In addition to other founders, you&#8217;ll also hear from enterprise leaders who decide what to buy &#8212; and the mistakes they see startups make when they try to sell to them.</p>
<p>But SaaS isn&#8217;t only about managing growth &#8212; though ideally, that&#8217;s a problem founders will face sooner or later. Some of the other specific topics we will look at are how to keep your services safe in an ever-growing threat environment, how to use open source to your advantage and how to smartly raise funding for your company.</p>
<p>We will also highlight how B2B and B2C companies can handle the glut of data they now produce and use it to build machine learning models in the process. We&#8217;ll talk about how SaaS startups can both do so themselves and help others in the process. There&#8217;s nary a startup that doesn&#8217;t want to use some form of AI these days, after all.</p>
<p>And because this is 2021, chances are we&#8217;ll also talk about building remote companies and the lessons SaaS startups can learn from the last year of working through the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.catchandrelease.com">Catch&amp;Release</a> founder and CEO Analisa Goodin told me that she wants to help brands break free from the limitations of stock photography — and that her startup has raised $14 million in Series A funding to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Goodin explained that the company started out as an image research firm before becoming a product-focused, venture-backed startup in 2015. The Series A was led by Accel (with participation from Cervin Ventures and other existing investors), and it brings Catch&amp;Release&#8217;s total funding to $26 million.</p>
<p>Stock media and video services are moving in this direction themselves, for example by introducing <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/206488441/eyeem">their own libraries of user-generated content</a>. Goodin applauded this, and she said Catch&amp;Release isn&#8217;t opposed to the use of stock photos — it integrates with these stock marketplaces. At the same time, she suggested that she has a much bigger vision.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This isn’t just about UGC, this is about tapping into the creative potential of the internet,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>After all, you can now find pretty much any kind of content you can imagine somewhere online, but &#8220;a lot of advertising agencies and brands have been trained that if a piece of content comes form internet, avoid it,&#8221; because it&#8217;s just &#8220;too hard&#8221; to figure out how to license it. (And indeed, that&#8217;s why I went with a stock photo for the lead image of this post.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140993" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140993" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140993" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?w=680" alt="Catch&amp;Release screenshot" width="680" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg 2952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=768,476 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=1536,951 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=2048,1268 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Product-shot-Instagram.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140993" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Catch&amp;Release</p></div></p>
<p>Catch&amp;Release aims to make that process as simple as possible, first with a browser extension that allows marketers to save any media that they find on the web, anytime they think they might want to use in their own campaigns (this is the &#8220;catch&#8221; part of the process). It even presents a &#8220;licensability score,&#8221; which is a rating based on factors like the person who posted the content, the description and the comments, indicating how likely it is that a marketer will actually be able to license this content.</p>
<p>Then, when someone from a brand or advertising agency decides that they want to use a piece of content, they can send a licensing request with a push of a button (this is the &#8220;release&#8221;). Catch&amp;Releases also analyzes the content for anything else that needs to be cleared or obscured, such as a company logo.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/lobster-nets-1m-to-scale-its-user-generated-content-licensing-marketplace/">other tools for licensing online content</a>, Goodwin emphasized that Catch&amp;Release isn&#8217;t just about finding photos for a social media campaign. Part of the goal, she said, is to erase the &#8220;stigma&#8221; around UGC, which now &#8220;represents the entire spectrum of culturally relevant content.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, she showed me <a href="https://www.catchandrelease.com/customer-work#red-lobster-the-hard-way">a Red Lobster commercial</a> that looks like a normal TV ad, but was in fact assembled entirely from footage found online — something that&#8217;s been even more useful in the past year, with pandemic-related safety concerns around large shoots. (Catch&amp;Release has also been used to license content for ads promoting TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company Verizon.)</p>
<p>Goodwin added that the new funding will allow Catch&amp;Release to continue investing in product, engineering and marketing.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one has defined the commercial licensing layer for the web,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What&#8217;s got me really excited to build this product is being that layer for the internet, not just for photos and videos, but for writing, art, graphics, and building the commercial licensing engine of the web.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a>, much of the last 8 years simply posting positive revenue growth was a challenge. In fact, the company had a period between 2013 and 2018 when it experienced<a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/19/ibm_fy2017_sales_growth/"> an astonishing 22 straight quarters</a> of negative revenue growth. So when Big Blue <a href="https://www.ibm.com/investor/att/pdf/IBM-1Q20-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf">reported yesterday</a> that revenue was up slightly, I&#8217;m sure the company took that as a win. Investors appear to be happy with the results with the stock up 4.73% this morning as of publication.</p>
<p>Consider that over the last 8 quarters encompassing FY2019 and FY2020, the company had only one positive revenue quarter when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/ibm-snaps-out-of-revenue-doldrums-breaking-a-five-quarter-losing-streak-in-q4/">it was up 0.1%</a> in Q42019. It had had five losing quarters prior to that one. When you look at yesterday&#8217;s report in that light, and combine it with growth in the Cloud and Cognitive Services group, it adds up to a decent quarter for IBM, one it badly needed after another negative report <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/ibm-transformation-struggles-continue-with-cloud-and-ai-revenue-down-4-5/">in the prior quarter.</a></p>
<p>Looking back at the January report, the company reported Cloud and Cognitive Services revenues down 4.5% at $6.8 billion, which was a big blow considering the company has been betting much of its future on those very areas, fueled in large part by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/">$34 billion Red Hat acquisition</a> in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IBM snaps out of its revenue doldrums, breaking a five-quarter losing streak in Q4&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/ibm-snaps-out-of-revenue-doldrums-breaking-a-five-quarter-losing-streak-in-q4/embed/#?secret=3Rq0al5sTp" data-secret="3Rq0al5sTp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Its most recent quarterly report proved much better with the company reporting Cloud and Cognitive Services revenues of $5.4 billion, up 3.8% YoY. Interestingly quarter-on-quarter revenue for the segment was down, but rose on a year-over-year basis. Perhaps a year-end enterprise revenue push could account for the difference between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021.</p>
<p>At any rate, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna saw today&#8217;s report as a positive sign that his attempts to push the company toward a future focused on hybrid computing and AI were starting to take root. He also saw enough in the report to predict some growth this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our last call, we shared our financial expectations for the year, revenue growth and $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. While it’s still early in the year and a lot remains to be done, we are confident enough to say that we are on track,&#8221; Krishna said in the earnings call with analysts yesterday.</p>
<p>The company has made a number of smaller acquisitions over the last year including a couple of consulting companies, which should help as they try to work with customers around the transition to hybrid computing and artificial intelligence, both of which tend to require a lot of hand-holding to get done.</p>

<p>At the same time of course, the company is continuing apace with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">its spin out of the legacy infrastructure services division</a>, which it announced last year. The plan at this point is to rename the company Kyndryl (an unfortunate choice) and complete the spin out by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>CFO Jim Kavanaugh also sees the modestly positive quarter as something the company can build on. &#8220;&#8230;in fact we are even more confident in the position we put in place with regards to our two most important measures, one, revenue growth, and second, adjusted free cash flow, which is going to provide the fuel for the investments needed for us to capture that hybrid cloud $1 trillion TAM,&#8221; Kavanaugh said in the earnings call with analysts.</p>
<p>All of this is being pushed by Red Hat, which grew revenue 15% in the most recent quarter, something the company is banking will continue to advance it deeper into positive territory throughout the rest of 2021.</p>
<p>Krishna is not looking for booming growth by any means. He just wants growth, and even sustained single digit top line expansion will make him happy. &#8220;Our systems if I take a two-year to three-year view kind of flattish, but in any given year it might increase or decrease but not by a whole lot. It doesn’t impact the topline a lot and that’s how sort of we get to the mid-single-digit sustainably,&#8221; Krishna said in the call.</p>
<p>The CEO simply wants to bring some long-term stability back to the company it has been sadly lacking in recent years. Of course, it&#8217;s hard to know if this quarter was a temporary upward blip on IBM&#8217;s earnings chart, one of those fluctuations up or down he spoke of, or if it is the corner the company has been looking to turn for years. Only time will tell whether IBM can sustain the modest revenue goals Krishna has set for the organization, or if it will fall back into the revenue doldrums that have plagued the company for the last eight years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The investment landscape for insurtech startups is off to a hot start in Q2 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment landscape for insurtech startups is off to a hot start in Q2 2021. Since the end of the first quarter, we’ve seen several players in the broad startup category announce new capital, including </span><a href="https://clearcover.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearcover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://alan.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.nextinsurance.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.thezebra.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zebra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as anyone who&#8217;s familiar with startups that offer insurance-related products and services knows, the sector is enough of a mixed bag that one needs to segment down to get clarity on how constituent companies are performing. So while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearcover</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s $200 million round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from <a href="https://clearcover.com/press/#/clearcover-raises-200-million">last week</a>, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/next-insurance-raises-250m-doubling-its-valuation-to-4b-in-under-a-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Insurance’s $250 million round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the first of the month and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/alan-raises-220-million-for-its-health-insurance-and-healthcare-super-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alan’s $220 million round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from yesterday are interesting, this morning we’re going to focus a bit more on The Zebra’s side of the insurtech house. </span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Exchange divides insurtech startups into three categories: neo-insurance providers, insurtech marketplaces and insurtech enablers. (You can see why we need to segment the insurtech genre!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briefly, neo-insurance providers are companies like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/root-targets-6b-valuation-in-pending-ipo-a-boon-for-insurtech-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/as-metromile-looks-to-go-public-insurtech-funding-is-on-the-rise/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metromile </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/as-next-insurance-makes-its-first-acquisition-insurtech-looks-energetic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next Insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which use technology to underwrite and sell insurance in an updated manner; these companies also often have optimized mobile experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketplaces like The Zebra, Gabi, Insurify and others provide a way for consumers to better identify their insurance options. And, finally, there are companies like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AgentSync</span></a>, which<span style="font-weight: 400;"> fit neatly into our third category of firms that help other companies in the insurance business digitize their operations or otherwise modernize. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This morning, let’s discuss insurtech’s 2020 as a whole, peek at some preliminary 2021 venture data and then dive deep into what we’ve collected regarding growth among insurtech marketplace players. The Exchange has data and other details from The Zebra, Insurify, Wefox and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covering longitudinal progress of specific startup categories is one of our favorite things to do. So, please, walk with us!</span></p>
<h2>2020 to today</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PitchBook data regarding </span><a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2020-emerging-tech-research-insurtech"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the insurtech category in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underscores how large the startup niche has grown. Per the data company, $18.3 billion was spent last year on insurtech startups across venture capital, private equity and M&amp;A activity. That was a billion dollars under its 2019 result, but given the pandemic’s onset, 2020’s final result is somewhat impressive &#8212; who expected insurance investing to hold up during an unprecedented global catastrophe?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year is proving lucrative for the insurtech market, at least from a venture capital perspective. Normally I’d make a joke about how unprofitable some neo-insurance providers are at this juncture, but because our focus is elsewhere, bringing up the fact that, say, Lemonade’s adjusted losses in the final quarter of 2020 were around 150% of its revenue is kind of irrelevant. So we won&#8217;t!<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wayup.com">WayUp</a> started out as a platform to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/wayup-gets-18-5-million-more-to-help-college-grads-find-jobs/">help college graduates find jobs and internships</a>, but over time, it has increasingly focused on helping employers find diverse job candidates. And it recently introduced a new feature to help those employers see exactly where their diversity and inclusion efforts may be falling short.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Liz Wessel explained that when companies aren&#8217;t hiring enough employees from diverse backgrounds, recruiters and executives often assume &#8220;we&#8217;re not getting enough of those candidates at the top of our funnel.&#8221; That idea, she suggested, is exemplified by Wells Fargo CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/22/wells-fargo-ceo-ruffles-feathers-with-comments-about-diverse-talent.html">Charles Schlarf&#8217;s controversial remarks last fall</a>, when he said the company wasn&#8217;t reaching its diversity goals because there simply aren&#8217;t enough qualified candidates.</p>
<p>Wessel suggested that when you take a look closer look at the data, you find that the initial outreach and recruiting is only part of the problem. WayUp&#8217;s new dashboard allows employers to track this, because it shows the demographic (race and gender) breakdown of the candidate pool at each part of the funnel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, Wessel said that many employers hiring for technical roles discover that they&#8217;re reaching a relatively diverse candidate pool during their initial outreach, and that the pool stays diverse during the first interviews — only to become much more white and male after the technical assessments/programming tests.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140948" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140948" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140948" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?w=680" alt="WayUp demographics dashboard" width="680" height="532" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?resize=300,235 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?resize=768,601 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?resize=680,532 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Demographics-by-Stage.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140948" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WayUp</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Similar to the SATs, many technical assessments have high correlation to socioeconomics status,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Upon discovering this, some recruiters may choose to stop requiring these tests. Others may choose to keep them — but thanks to WayUp, at least they know where the breakdown is really happening.</p>
<p>After Wessel showed me the dashboard, I wondered why other hiring platforms didn&#8217;t offer something similar. In a follow-up email, she suggested that many platforms don&#8217;t realize that achieving these goals requires about more than just getting a diverse diverse pool of candidates. Plus, she said WayUp is &#8220;one of the only sourcing/job platforms that I know of that has candidates self-report their race/ethnicity, gender and veteran status (in an EEOC/OFCCP compliant way).&#8221;</p>
<p>She added, &#8220;We really are focusing on having our platform make it so your entire hiring process is equitable and optimizes for employers hiring a diverse workforce, [versus] putting a Band-Aid or quick fix on the issue by just sourcing more diverse candidates at the top of your funnel.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farshad Yousefi and Masoud Jalali used to drive through Palo Alto neighborhoods and marvel at the outrageous home prices. But the drives sparked an idea. They were not in a financial position to purchase a home in those neighborhoods (to be clear, not many people are) either for investment or to live. But what if they could invest in homes in up and coming cities throughout the U.S.?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then they realized that even that might be a challenge considering that with all their student debt, affording a down payment would be impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was nothing available out there besides a crowdfunding platform, which when we first signed up, took away $1,000 from our account that we didn’t have, and then our capital would be locked up for 3 to 10 years,” recalls Yousefi.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the pair started doing research and spoke to 1,000 individuals under the age of 35. Eight out of 10 said they would like to invest in real estate but were deterred by all the barriers to entry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is clearly a large demand for access to real estate,” Yousefi said. “And we wanted to give people a way to invest in it like they can in stocks, via a mobile app.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so the idea for <a href="https://www.fintor.com">Fintor</a> was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yousefi and Jalali founded the company in 2020 with the goal of purchasing homes via an LLC, and turning each into shares through a SEC-approved broker dealer. Individuals can then buy shares of the homes via Fintor’s platform. Its next step is to sign agreements with individual real estate investors or bigger real estate development firms to list their properties on the platform and give people the opportunity to buy shares</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now Fintor has raised $2.5 million in seed money to continue building out its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fractional real estate investing platform. The startup aims to “fractionalize” houses and other residential property, giving people in the U.S. access to investment opportunities “starting with as little as $5.” The company attracted the interest of investors such as 500 Startups, Hustle Fund, Graphene Ventures, Houston-based real estate investor Manny Khoshbin, Mana Ventures and other angel investors such as Cindy Bi, Skyler Fernandes, VU Venture Partners, Minal Hasan, Andrew Zalasin, Alluxo CEO and Founder Safa Mahzari, SquareFoot CEO and founder Jonathan Wasserstrum and Teachable CEO and founder Ankur Nagpal.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140934" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140934" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2140934" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="593" height="445" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fintor-mobile-app.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140934" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fintor</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintor is eying markets such as Kansas City, South Carolina, and Houston, Texas, where it already has some properties. It’s looking for homes in the $80,000 to $350,000 price range, and millennials and GenZers are its target demographic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fintor can give the same return as the stock market, but at half the risk,” Yousefi said. “As two [Iranian] immigrants, we’ve seen how much this country has to offer and how real estate sits at the top of everything, yet is so inaccessible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair had originally set out to raise just $1 million but the round was quickly “way oversubscribed,” according to Yousefi, and they ended up raising $2.5 million at triple the original valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jalali said the company will use machine learning technology to filter and rate properties as it scales its business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll use ML to categorize neighborhoods and to come up with the price of properties to offer to potential sellers,” he added. “Our ultimate goal is to create indexes so that people can invest in multiple properties in a given city. That creates diversification right away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Yin, co-founder and general partner of Hustle Fund, believes that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintor is solving a generational problem with real estate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Retail investors have almost no access to great real estate investments today and the best opportunities are reserved for the select few,” she told TechCrunch. “Not to mention that in addition to access, retail investors often need a lot of capital in order to have a diversified portfolio or be accredited to join funds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintor’s approach to securitize real estate assets will give millions of investors who are not accredited investors access they would otherwise not have had, Yin added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Simultaneously, it provides increased liquidity to property owners, while improving the user experience for both parties,” she said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effectively this becomes a new asset class, because it’s entirely turnkey and is fractionalized, which opens up many new pockets of investors.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/19/apple-just-created-and-killed-a-generation-of-ar-businesses/">introduction of ARKit</a> changed the game for entrepreneurs, not unlike the App Store did on a much, <em>much</em> larger scale back in 2008.</p>
<p>One entrepreneur, <a href="https://twitter.com/luckyloberg">Dana Loberg</a>, has capitalized on the launch of ARKit with her startup <a href="https://leoapp.com/">Leo AR</a>.</p>
<p>Leo is the result of a few pivots. The company first started out as MojiLala, which launched out of <a href="https://www.betaworks.com/">betaworks</a>. It was a hassle-free sticker marketplace that allowed artists to upload their stickers and sell them through the platform for end-users to use in a number of locations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2017, MojiLala <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/surreal-wants-to-be-the-one-stop-shop-for-3d-virtual-objects/">released a new app called Surreal</a>, which allowed artists to sell virtual objects to end users and lay them over their camera to record fun content. Now as Leo AR, the company is focused on 3D augmented reality objects without losing focus on giving artists an easy-to-use outlet for their virtual wares.</p>
<p>Today, Leo is announcing the raise of a $3 million seed round led by <a href="http://www.greatoaksvc.com/">Great Oaks Ventures</a>, with participation from Dennis Phelps of IVP, betaworks, <a href="https://www.dtcp.capital/">Deutsch Telekom</a>, <a href="https://www.quakecapital.com/">Quake Capital</a>, and other angel investors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140921" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140921" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140921" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed.gif?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140921" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Leo AR</p></div></p>
<p>The app operates on a freemium basis, letting end users subscribe to certain artists they like on the platform. Leo takes a 30 percent cut on those purchases, but Loberg said that her main priority beyond generating revenue is ensuring that artists get paid well and are incentivized to create and sell through her platform.</p>
<p>Loberg also shared that the app has exploded in popularity among children, who enjoy creating videos with dinosaurs or dragons in them.</p>
<p>In fact, Leo users have created more than 8 million videos on the platform, and active users add more than 85 3D objects to their scenes and average 10+ minutes in the app when they use it.</p>
<p>Leo not only lets users distribute their content out to other platforms like Instagram, but it also has a feed of the best videos created in Leo for others to check out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As AI improves, the possibilities of what we can do with the technology grow exponentially (for better or worse). <a href="https://www.synthesia.io/">Synthesia</a>, an AI video generation platform, is looking to make video content creation as simple and efficient as possible, and FirstMark is taking a bet on it making the world better, and not worse.</p>
<p>The company has just announced the close of a $12.5 million Series A funding round led by <a href="https://firstmarkcap.com/">FirstMark Capital</a>, with participation from angels Christian Bach (CEO, Netlify) and Michael Buckley (VP Communications, Twilio), as well as existing investors <a href="https://www.ldv.co/">LDV Capital</a>, <a href="https://mmc.vc/">MMC Ventures</a>, <a href="https://seedcamp.com/">Seedcamp</a>, Mark Cuban, Taavet Hinrikus, Martin Varsavsky, and <a href="https://www.tiny.vc/">TinyVC</a>.</p>
<p>Though Synthesia&#8217;s technology could be applied to dozens of use cases, the startup is focused initially on educational content for organizations and enterprises. Think training videos and company- or department-wide video updates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: Users can choose from a library of existing actors (who get paid per video they appear in) or upload their own video to create an avatar. To use their own voice and avatar, Synthesia walks them through instructions on what type of video and audio they should send in.</p>
<p>Users can then type in a script, add other components like text, images, shapes, etc. and ultimately generate the video without any video creation or editing skills whatsoever. It&#8217;s also super easy to update or edit the video without having to do any traditional video editing.</p>
<p>The startup is well aware of how this platform could be used nefariously, and has built in multiple layers of security and authentication to ensure that users are aware of how their avatar is being used in videos, with the ability to check the script or the video before it&#8217;s generated or published.</p>
<p>Not only can this platform be used for the dozen or so training and educational videos that a company deploys each year, but it can be used in more creative ways. The general principle is that video content is more compelling and engaging than text or other content. So imagine, say, that the weekly emails that come from your manager or CEO with updates on the business came in the form of video. With Synthesia, it&#8217;s super easy and low-cost to create that video quickly.</p>
<p>Synthesia has an entry-level plan, which costs $30 per month per seat and offers 10 minutes of video per month. The startup also has an enterprise level plan that starts at $500 per month and comes with more video minutes and extra functionality.</p>
<p>The company plans on using the funding to fuel customer growth and product development.</p>
<p>Beyond the enterprise video platform, Synthesia is also working on an API that would allow organizations to hook the Synthesia tech into their own systems <em>and</em> distribute that video. Cofounder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/vriparbelli?lang=en">Victor Riparbelli</a> showed an example where users could choose a stock and plug in a phone number that would automatically create a video with a daily stock price update and distribute that video to the specified phone number.</p>
<p>The enterprise product, called STUDIO, launched into public beta in the summer of 2020 and has since amassed more than 1000 companies as users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pragma.gg">Pragma</a> is building what it calls a &#8220;backend as a service,&#8221; providing ready-made infrastructure to developers of online, live service games. And it&#8217;s announcing today that it has raised $12 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by David Thacker at Greylock, with participation from Zynga founder Mark Pincus, Oculus founder Nate Mitchell and Cloudera founder Amr Awadallah, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/pragma-is-a-backend-toolkit-for-gaming-companies-so-game-developers-can-focus-on-games/">previous investors</a> Upfront Ventures and Advancit Capital. Amy Chang, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/cisco-acquires-accompany/">sold her business intelligence startup Accompany</a> to Cisco, is joining Pragma&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Eden Chen told me that where Unity and Unreal have built popular frontend game engines, he and his co-founder Chris Cobb (former engineering lead at Riot Games) are hoping Pragma will fill the void for a &#8220;de facto backend game engine.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while &#8220;many companies tried to do this&#8221; over the past decade, Chen suggested that this is the right time to launch the platform, thanks to the continued rise of live service games (like League of Legends) that have to be treated as &#8220;living, breathing products,&#8221; as well as improved tooling around infrastructure platforms like Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140903" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140903" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140903" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?w=680" alt="Pragma screenshot" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140903" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pragma</p></div></p>
<p>Pragma is launching a <a href="https://pragma.gg/starter-kit">starter kit</a> today designed to allow developers to quickly set up and test game loops. Meanwhile, the broader platform is currently in private beta testing with studios including One More Game (started by started by Pat Wyatt, one of Blizzard’s first employees) and Mitchell&#8217;s Mountain Top Studios.</p>
<p>Chen said the platform&#8217;s features fall into three broad categories — player accounts/social, game loops (including lobbies and matchmaking) and player/game data. Pragma isn&#8217;t building all of this from scratch; in some cases, it&#8217;s &#8220;acting as the integrator&#8221; for other platforms like Discord. Chen also noted that while the team plans to build a fully managed solution in the future, the current version is on-premise: &#8220;We’re building an instance of Pragma on the studio’s own infrastructure, [so they can] so they can take our code base and customize it to their own preferences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pragma is initially targeting game studios with about 10 to 50 team members. Eventually, Chen hopes the platform could serve larger studios while also supporting &#8220;the democratization of these tools, so that a one- to five-person team can really leverage [them] to launch a networked, online game.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;The vision for us long term is that we really want to be innovating on the social side, creating social features that improve the game and build stronger connections.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Scale AI announced a massive $325 million Series E. Led by Dragoneer, Greenoaks Capital and Tiger Global, the raise gives the San Francisco data labeling startup a $7 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Alexandr Wang founded the company back in 2016, while still at MIT. A veteran of Quora and Addepar, Wang built the startup to curate information for AI applications. The company is now a break-even business, with a wide range of top-notch clients, including General Motors, NVIDIA, Nuro and Zoox.</p>
<p>Backed by a ton of venture capital, the company plans a large-scale increase in its headcount, as it builds out new products and expands into additional markets. “One thing that we saw, especially in the course of the past year, was that AI is going to be used for so many different things,” Wang told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/the-station-a-chat-with-scale-ais-alexandr-wang-the-nyc-scooter-winners-and-tusimple-goes-public/">TechCrunch in a recent interview</a>. “It’s like we’re just sort of really at the beginning of this and we want to be prepared for that as it happens.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The executive will join us on stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=alexandr&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=alexandr&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> on June 9 to discuss how the company has made a major impact on the industry in its short four years of existence, the role AI is playing in the world of transportation and what the future looks like for Scale AI.</p>
<p>In addition to Wang,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=groupsales&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=groupsales&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> will feature an incredible lineup of speakers, presentations, fireside chats and breakouts all focused on the current and future state of mobility — like EVs, micromobility and smart cities for starters — and the investment trends that influence them all.</p>
<p>Investors like <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> (Urban Innovation Fund), <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> (Autotech Ventures) and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> (Construct Capital) — all of whom will grace our virtual stage. They’ll have plenty of insight and advice to share, including the challenges that startup founders will face as they break into the transportation arena.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from CEOs like Starship Technologies’ <strong>Ahti Heinla</strong>. The company’s been busy testing delivery robots in real-world markets. Don’t miss his discussion touching on challenges ranging from technology to red tape and what it might take to make last-mile robotic delivery a mainstream reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.co.uk/shopping-and-entertainment/introducing-amazon-salon">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s opening Amazon Salon, the retailer&#8217;s first hair salon and a place where Amazon aims to test new technologies with the general public. The salon will occupy over 1,500 sq. ft on Brushfield Street in London’s Spitalfields, where Amazon says it will initially be trialing the use of augmented reality (AR) and &#8220;point-and-learn&#8221; technology &#8212; the latter being a system that allow customers to point to products on a display shelf in order to learn more through videos and other content that then appears on a display screen.</p>
<p>To then order the products, the customers will scan the QR code on the shelf, which takes them to the Amazon.co.uk shopping page for the item where they can add it to their cart and check out.</p>

<p>The salon&#8217;s AR technology, meanwhile, will be used to allow customers to experiment by virtually trying on different hair colors before making a commitment to a new shade.</p>
<p>Amazon has already entered the convenience store market, grocery business and other physical retail, where it&#8217;s innovating with new technologies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/">cashierless checkout</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/amazon-to-test-dash-cart-a-smart-grocery-shopping-cart-that-sees-what-you-buy/">smart grocery carts</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/amazon-expands-its-biometric-based-amazon-one-palm-reader-system-to-more-retail-stores/">biometric systems</a>. But it&#8217;s not clear that Amazon actually has ambitions to be in the salon business itself. Instead, it seems the salon will largely serve as a testing ground for new technologies that Amazon will likely want to sell to other retail clients in the future, or perhaps implement in its own stores. And in the case of AR, Amazon may want to gather data on customers&#8217; experiences it can use on its own shopping site, too.</p>
<p>Hinting that its goals are not about the salon business itself, Amazon today describes the salon as an &#8220;experiential venue where we showcase new products and technology,&#8221; and notes that it has no other plans to open more salons at this time.</p>
<p>The company has also recruited an existing salon owner, Elena Lavagni of Neville Hair &amp; Beauty Salon, to help with this project, instead of hiring a new staff to run it long-term. Lavagni and her team have previously provided hairdressing services for other events, like Paris Fashion Week and the Cannes Film Festival.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140873" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140873" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140873" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg 1624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=768,596 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=680,528 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=1536,1192 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140873" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon has not detailed what sort of data it will collect from customers who use the salon, but it&#8217;s clearly there to learn about how new retail technologies would work in a real-world environment. But the fact that Amazon is capturing customer images for its hair color virtual try-on should raise questions about what it plans to do with the data it collects from the new salon. Will it only be used to learn about the specific technology being tested, or will it be put to other uses, too?</p>
<p>As many recall, Amazon has a complicated history with its use of technologies like facial recognition and biometrics, having <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">sold biometric facial recognition services</a> to law enforcement in the U.S., while its facial recognition technology <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">was the subject of a data privacy lawsuit</a>. And its Ring camera <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-2000-police-fire-departments-213301374.html">company continues</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/over-30-civil-rights-groups-demand-an-end-to-amazon-rings-police-partnerships/">work in partnership with police.</a> Customers should be told if they&#8217;re participating in an Amazon research project, not just having fun with new tech products.</p>
<p>Like other Amazon physical stores, the salon will first be open to Amazon employees only before offering bookings to the wider public in the weeks to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://capeprivacy.com/">Cape Privacy</a>, the early stage startup that wants to make it easier for companies to share sensitive data in a secure and encrypted way, announced a $20 million Series A today.</p>
<p>Evolution Equity Partners led the round with participation from new investors Tiger Global Management, Ridgeline Partners and Downing Lane. Existing investors Boldstart Ventures, Version One Ventures, Haystack, Radical Ventures and a slew of individual investors also participated. The company has now raised approximately $25 million including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/cape-privacy-launches-data-science-collaboration-platform-with-5-06m-seed-investment/">$5 million seed investment</a> we covered last June..</p>
<p>Cape Privacy CEO Ché Wijesinghe says that the product has evolved quite a bit since we last spoke. &#8220;We have really focused our efforts on encrypted learning, which is really the core technology, which was fundamental to allowing the multi-party compute capabilities between two organizations or two departments to work and build machine learning models on encrypted data,&#8221; Wijesinghe told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wijesinghe says that a key business case involves a retail company owned by a private equity firm sharing data with a large financial services company, which is using the data to feed its machine learning models. In this case, sharing customer data, it&#8217;s essential to do it in a secure way and that is what Cape Privacy claims is its primary value prop.</p>
<p>He said that while the data sharing piece is the main focus of the company, it has data governance and compliance components to be sure that entities sharing data are doing so in a way that complies with internal and external rules and regulations related to the type of data.</p>
<p>While the company is concentrating on financial services for now because Wijesinghe has been working with these companies for years, he sees uses cases far beyond a single vertical including pharmaceuticals, government, healthcare telco and manufacturing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every single industry needs this and so we look at the value of what Cape&#8217;s encrypted learning can provide as really being something that can be as transformative and be as impactful as what SSL was for the adoption of the web browser,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Richard Seewald, founding and managing partner at lead investor Evolution Equity Partners likes that ability to expand the product&#8217;s markets. &#8220;The application in Financial Services is only the beginning. Cape has big plans in life sciences and government where machine learning will help make incredible advances in clinical trials and counter-terrorism for example. We anticipate wide adoption of Cape’s technology across many use cases and industries,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company has recently expanded to 20 people and Wijesinghe, who is half Asian, takes DEI seriously. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been very, very deliberate about our DEI efforts, and I think one of the things that we pride ourselves in is that we do foster a culture of acceptance, that it&#8217;s not just about diversity in terms of color, race, gender, but we just hired our first non binary employee,&#8221; he said,</p>
<p>Part of making people feel comfortable and included involves training so that fellow employees have a deeper understanding of the cultural differences. The company certainly has diversity across geographies with employees in 10 different time zones.</p>
<p>The company is obviously remote with a spread like that, but once the pandemic is over, Wijesinghe sees bringing people together on occasion with New York City as the hub for the company where people from all over the world can fly in and get together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many large enterprises now rely on hundreds of third-party SaaS applications to do business, but their security organizations can barely keep pace. Right now, the state of the art for SaaS enterprise security are cloud access security brokers (CASBs) that act as intermediaries between users and the actual service. But they don&#8217;t provide the kind of visibility that enterprises want since employees will often route around their IT departments. Tel Aviv-based Grip Security aims to make this a lot easier by providing enterprises with full visibility into their SaaS portfolios through enforceable endpoint-centric access controls and new data governance capabilities that work across devices and locations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grip.security/">Grip Security</a> today announced that it has raised a $6 million seed round led by cybersecurity-focused <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a>, with participation from CrowdStrike CEO and co-founder George Kurtz and a group of other angel investors with deep roots in the cybersecurity industry. These include the likes of former Akamai CSO Andy Ellis, former Zscaler CISO Michael Sutton, former Bank of America Chief Security Scientist Sounil Yu and Amazon Whole Foods CISO Sameer Sait.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140774" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-205533.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140774" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2140774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-205533.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="204" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-205533.png 581w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-205533.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-205533.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-205533.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140774" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Grip Security</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The founding team at Grip Security brings deep technical acumen to disrupt the SaaS security market,&#8221; said Ofer Schreiber, partner at YL Ventures. &#8220;Grip will not only upend antiquated SaaS security solutions, but they’ll also help enterprises implement much needed automated and granular security for SaaS, the fastest growing segment in information technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before starting Grip Security, co-founder and CEO Lior Yaari actually spent some time as the CTO of YL Ventures (though he says he still had to go through the firm&#8217;s standard vetting procedure to get funding). In that role, he talked to a lot of CISOs, and, again and again, they talked to him about the problems with current SaaS security solutions. Like his co-founders, Idan Fast (CTO) and Alon Shenkler (VP R&amp;D), Yaari also has a deep cybersecurity background. But it was during his time YL Ventures that the idea for Grip Security was born.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within YL Ventures, we were always looking for the next interesting sub-market and we knew from our conversation with CISOs  [&#8230;] that people know SaaS is a problem and they did not like the existing solutions &#8212; many of them being CASBs,&#8221; Yaari told me. &#8220;From this view of an investment team that not only talks with customers but also sees some technical teams that try to solve this problem and then go back and look for other solutions because they didn&#8217;t find a good fit within the market, I eventually wanted to do it myself. Last July, I actually told [YL Ventures partner Ofer Schreiber] that if no one solved this until October, I will. That was a joke back then &#8212; and then, three or four months later, it became reality. It&#8217;s hard to look at hard and interesting problems without trying to solve them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the popular CASBs today were founded around 2013 and 2014 and then later acquired by other major players like Microsoft, Cisco and Proofpoint. But Yaari argues that the problems with protecting SaaS today is fundamentally different from those 10 years ago. These solutions, he argues, worked for protecting a dozen applications or so.</p>
<p>The promise of Grip Security is that after a quick installation, enterprises get full visibility into which applications their employees actually use. Yaari wasn&#8217;t quite ready to give away the secret sauce of how Grip does this, though. But he noted that this is a non-intrusive solution. &#8220;We do not install anything on user devices or corporate networks, but we follow the footprints left by SaaS applications and use this data to identify with extreme accuracy what applications were used.&#8221; He noted that Grip Security&#8217;s solution travels with the users, no matter which device they use.</p>
<p>Grip Security currently has about 15 employees and plans to use the new funding to build out its platform with additional capabilities, especially around providing access governance and data governance to applications. The plan is to grow to 20 to 25 employees within the next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After five years of providing non-dilutive financing for founders, Clearbanc is tired of being only a bank. So, it’s rebranding, and has just raised $100 million Series C at a $2 billion valuation off of its broader ambitions. The new valuation is five times larger than it was when Clearbanc closed a Series B <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/clearbanc-300m/">in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Clearbanc has renamed itself Clearco, a move that is more in line with the company’s long-term vision of providing data-driven solutions for founders, say co-founders Michele Romanow and Andrew D’Souza.</p>
<p>“We’re moving from just being a capital provider and [having] sort of a transactional relationship with our customers to really using data, our network, guidance, [and] capital to be a long-term partner,” D’Souza said. In other words, Clearco wants founders to think of the company as more than a check-writing machine.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today’s news a step away from what Clearco framed itself around just two years ago: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/clearbanc-plans-to-disrupt-venture-capital-with-the-20-min-term-sheet/">the 20-minute term-sheet.</a> The product, perhaps its most well-known in tech, allowed e-commerce companies to raise non-dilutive marketing growth capital between $10,000 to $10 million based on its revenue and ad spend. The founders then flexed rapid capital deployment based on data &#8211; and to date, Clearco has put over $2 billion in over 4,600 companies.</p>
<p>“We can provide you the capital, really efficiently but then we can also help you figure out what to do with that capital to grow your business, and increase the value, and that was a big part of the motivation around the rebrand,” D’Souza said.</p>
<p>Clearco has been on a tear of new product launches in the past year. In April 2020, Clearco launched ClearRunway to help SaaS founders secure non-dilutive capital repaid through revenue-share agreements. A few months later, in July, <a href="https://blog.clearbanc.com/clearbanc-valuation/">it launched a way</a> for founders to figure out how to value their companies based on benchmarking data and internal metrics. In October, Clearco launched a tool that would purchase a company’s inventory upfront directly from suppliers, and is then paid back <a href="https://blog.clearbanc.com/upfront-inventory-financing/">as products sell. </a>And in February, the company announced that it had created <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/how-capital-as-a-service-can-help-you-get-your-first-check-in-2021/">Clearangel</a>, a product similar to its 20-minute term sheet, but focused on founders who bring in less revenue.</p>

<p>The growth hasn’t come without challenges. In April 2020, the same month it launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/as-vcs-pull-back-clearbanc-launches-a-way-for-startups-to-get-runway/">ClearRunway</a>, Clearco laid off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/clearbanc-cuts-number-of-staff-to-navigate-long-term-economic-impact-of-covid-19/">8% of its workforce</a>, or 17 people. The company said it would be writing more conservative checks, more frequently. At that time, it gave $1 billion to 2,200 companies. By now, it has sent $2 billion to  4,500 companies, a mix between startups and online businesses.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As VCs pull back, Clearbanc launches a way for startups to get runway&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/as-vcs-pull-back-clearbanc-launches-a-way-for-startups-to-get-runway/embed/#?secret=CGphCKNteD" data-secret="CGphCKNteD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company, still unprofitable, declined to close ARR, but instead pointed to another proxy: With all of its capital products, Clearco makes 6% in fees when it is repaid. Last year, Clearco spent $1 billion on its companies. This means that Clearco brought in around $60 million in sales last year.</p>
<p>“We were very naive when we started the business around the complexity around how fast you could lose a lot of money if you don’t get things right,” he said. Romanow added that in the beginning, Clearco had “very, very high loss rates” and it has gotten better with more data over time. The company is doubling down on different channels to get and shape and convey that data thus feels like a logical next step.</p>
<p>Since inception in 2015, Clearco’s biggest challenge was scaling the capital market side of its business and making sure it consistently had funds available. With the new product suite, Clearco’s new biggest challenge will be providing valuable services, consistently, to companies and balancing that mentorship with these checks.</p>
<p>Many of Clearco’s newest products are still in their infancy, but the potential success of the startup could nearly be tied to the general growth of startups looking for alternatives to venture capital when financing their startups. Similar to how AngelList’s growth is neatly tied to the growth of emerging fund managers, Clearco’s growth is cleanly related to the growth of founders who see financing as beyond a seed check from Y Combinator.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe anyone becomes a founder because they&#8217;re like, &#8216;I can&#8217;t wait to fundraise right now and can&#8217;t wait to like figure out which software to use&#8217;,&#8221; Romanow said. &#8220;They just want to build products and market incredible products [and] we&#8217;re just trying to make it easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its latest round was led by Oak HC/FT, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/oak-hc-ft-1-4-billion/"> closed a $1.4 billion fund in February</a>. In other words, a traditional venture capital firm backed a company that is betting that the future of raising financing for a startup is beyond venture capital. And, while meta, it’s a signal worth pointing out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community banks and credit unions aim to be the heart of the, well, communities, they serve. But without the big budgets of larger institutions, keeping up technology-wise can be a challenge. And not only are they competing with legacy players, there is also a slew of digital banks that have emerged in recent years, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="http://www.mantl.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MANTL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that has developed technology to make it easier for people to open accounts digitally at community banks and credit unions so that those institutions can increase deposits and ultimately, profits. Founded in 2016, New York-based Mantl has been described by some as “the Shopify of account opening.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community banks and credit unions make up a big percentage of all banking institutions, which means Mantl&#8217;s market opportunity is pretty darn large. The fintech’s revenue increased by &#8220;2.1x&#8221; in 2020 as financial institutions clamored to meet increased demand for digital offerings from consumers in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the company is announcing it has raised $40 million in a Series B round of funding led by Alphabet’s independent growth fund, CapitalG, to help it grow even more. The financing brings Mantl’s total funding raised since inception to $60.7 million and included participation from D1 Capital Partners, BoxGroup and existing backers Point72 Ventures, Clocktower Technology Ventures and OldSlip Group. The company <a href="https://tearsheet.co/modern-banking-experience/with-deposit-volume-growing-705-in-april-mantl-raises-19-million/">raised $19 million</a> last July after growing deposit volume by 705% in April of that year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup declined to reveal hard revenue figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mantl originally set out to build its own challenger bank, but in doing so realized there are 10,000 banks and credit unions in the U.S., and that 96% of them outsourced their technology to third-party legacy vendors such as Fiserv and Jack Henry, many of which have technology that is in some cases “decades old,” according to Nathaniel Harley, co-founder and CEO at Mantl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such outdated technology has kept many financial institutions such as community banks and credit unions from competing online, and also limits the digital banking options available to consumers, the company said.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;(How to fix) 5 common UX mistakes in online banking&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uxtra-crunch-banks-customer-support/embed/#?secret=27riQxaDoC" data-secret="27riQxaDoC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the company pivoted, based on the premise that most community banks and credit unions are critical to maintaining competition and equity in the United States’ financial system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At a high level, Mantl is an enterprise software company that is really focused on helping traditional financial institutions modernize and grow,” Harley told TechCrunch. “Our mission at the end of the day is to really expand the access to financial services by taking on the legacy infrastructure, which has really hindered access to digital banking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that its white-labeled account opening software allows banks and customers “to open an account from anywhere at any time, on any device in less than three minutes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rough its flagship account opening software, Mantl claims to have helped community institutions — many of which are competing online for the first time — establish efficient </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">profitable digital operations. Among the community banks it works with are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross River Bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quontic</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midwest BankCentre</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Banks are naturally very risk averse, and we need to build trust in order to fully take on that full infrastructure that they&#8217;re working in,” Harley said. “Account opening is low risk, but it&#8217;s also extremely high value considering that less than 50% of banks actually have online account opening today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mantl integrates directly into the legacy infrastructure, also known as a core banking system, in order to enhance that system and help institutions launch digital products quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its software also automates application decisioning for over 90% of cases while also reducing fraud by more than 60%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This results in deposit growth that’s &#8220;typically 4x faster than other solutions on the market and up to 10x more cost-effective than building a new branch,” the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined, the institutions it works with have onboarded hundreds of thousands of new customers and raised billions of dollars in core deposits, the company claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re challenging the legacy infrastructure that is holding community institutions back,” Harley said,&#8221; and we see account opening as just the beginning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to do some hiring and expand its product offerings, including software that it says would be able to improve and digitize the onboarding experience for not just financial institutions but businesses of all sizes, from sole proprietors to complex commercial enterprises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CapitalG partner Jesse Wedler shares Mantl’s belief that banks form the backbone of this nation’s economy, both on a local and national level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While digitization has long been a priority for banks, it has become an urgent imperative as branches close and digital disruptors grow,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As CapitalG reviewed the landscape of companies helping banks with digital transformation, Mantl stood out, Wedler said, due to its “user experience, resulting deposit growth and time-to-value for banks of all sizes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what has his firm most excited, he added, is the team’s vision for “transforming adjacent core banking applications.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding in 2013, CapitalG has invested in a number of fintechs, including MX, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe, Robinhood, Credit Karma, Albert, Aye Finance and LendingClub. </span></p>
