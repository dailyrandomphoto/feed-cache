										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Nigerian government via its Ministry of Information and Culture today announced its decision to suspend the activities of social media platform Twitter in the country.</p>
<p>The statement which was made by Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, and signed off by his media aide Segun Adeyemi could see telecoms in the country prevent Nigerians from using Twitter.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the statement issued by the ministry:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Government has suspended indefinitely the operations of the microblogging and social networking service Twitter in Nigeria. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, citing the presistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria&#8217;s corporate existence.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Comission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement is a culmination of events that have happened this past week. Yesterday, Twitter deleted tweets and videos of President Muhammadu Buhari making threats of punishment to a sect called IPOB in the South-Eastern part of the country after he blamed them for attacks on government buildings. For that, he referenced the events that happened in Nigeria&#8217;s civil war back in the 1960s which seemed offensive to many Nigerians.</p>
<p>Buhari who was the country&#8217;s Head of State in the 1980s and served in the army against secessionists said young Nigerians in the southeastern part of the country were too young to remember the horrible events that occurred during the war. According to him, the activities of the present-day secessionists are likely headed towards war, hence, it was prereogative to stop them beforehand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Twitter decided to delete the tweet after several calls by Nigerians to take them down and also because it violated the platform&#8217;s abusive behaviour policy. Twitter also suspended the president&#8217;s account leaving it in a &#8216;read-only mode&#8217; for 12 hours.</p>
<p>Following Twitter&#8217;s decision, Mr Mohammed called out Twitter by saying the social media company was biased in its decision and raised suspicion about the platform&#8217;s intention in the country.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Twitter for comments.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Tesla sales have risen, interest in the company has exploded, prompting investment and interest in the automotive industry, as well as the startup world.</p>
<p>Tezlab, a free app that&#8217;s like a Fitbit for a Tesla vehicle, is just one example of the numerous startups that have sprung up in the past few years as electric vehicles have started to make the tiniest of dents in global sales. Now, as Ford, GM, Volvo, Hyundai along with newcomers Rivian, Fisker and others launch electric vehicles into the marketplace, more startups are sure to follow.</p>
<p>Ben Schippers, the co-founder and CEO of Tezlab, is one of two early-stage founders who will join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=tezlab&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=tezlab&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> to talk about their startups and the opportunities cropping up in this emerging age of EVs. The six-person team behind TezLab was born out of HappyFunCorp, a software engineering shop that builds apps for mobile, web, wearables and Internet of Things devices for clients that include Amazon, Facebook and Twitter, as well as an array of startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>HFC’s engineers, including Schippers, who also co-founded HFC, were attracted to Tesla  because of its techcentric approach and one important detail: the Tesla API endpoints are accessible to outsiders. The Tesla API is technically private. But it exists allowing the Tesla&#8217;s app to communicate with the cars to do things like read battery charge status and lock doors. When reverse-engineered, it’s possible for a third-party app to communicate directly with the API.</p>
<p>Schippers&#8217; experience extends beyond scaling up Tezlab. Schippers consults and works with companies focused on technology and human interaction, with a sub-focus in EV.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=tezlab&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=tezlab&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The list of speakers at our 2021 event</a> is growing by the day and includes Motional&#8217;s president and CEO Karl Iagnemma and Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson, who will discuss the past, present and future of AVs. On the electric front is Mate Rimac, the founder of Rimac Automobili, who will talk about scaling his startup from a one-man enterprise in a garage to more than 1,000 people and contracts with major automakers.</p>
<p>We also recently announced a panel dedicated to China&#8217;s robotaxi industry, featuring three female leaders from Chinese AV startups: AutoX&#8217;s COO Jewel Li, Huan Sun, general manager of Momenta Europe with Momenta, and WeRide&#8217;s VP of Finance Jennifer Li.</p>
<p>Other guests include, GM&#8217;s VP of Global Innovation Pam Fletcher, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, Joby Aviation founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt, investor and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman (whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby), investors Clara Brenner of Urban Innovation Fund, Quin Garcia of Autotech Ventures and Rachel Holt of Construct Capital, and Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson.</p>
<p>And we may even have one more surprise — a classic TechCrunch stealth company reveal to close the show.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t wait to book your tickets to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=tezlab&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=tezlab&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> as prices go up at our virtual door.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch announced today that they will release major updates to their Emotes this month to celebrate their 10th anniversary. These new features will include Animated Emotes, Follower Emotes, and a Library for Emotes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the origin of the live streaming platform for gamers, Emotes – Twitch’s version of emojis – have been a key component of </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/14/17335670/twitch-emotes-meaning-list-kappa-monkas-omegalul-pepe-trihard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They’re micro memes, and images like Kappa, TriHard, and PogChamp have come to carry meaning in the greater gaming world, even off the Twitch platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Emotes are a language that transcends countries,&#8221; said Ivan Santana, Senior Director of Community Product at Twitch. &#8220;Anywhere you are in the world, they mean the same thing for us.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Amazon-owned platform regularly adds new global Emotes, which can be used on any streamer’s channel. Individual creators can make custom Emotes for their own community, which paying subscribers can use across the platform. But the ability to add animated gifs as Emotes is something that the community has been asking for since Santana can remember. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been at Twitch for four years, and it’s something people have been asking for since before I joined,” Santana told TechCrunch. “It’s certainly been a very, very long time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamers who lack animation skills need not worry. While the more tech-savvy among us can upload custom gifs, Twitch will provide six templates for streamers to choose from, which can animate their existing Emotes. These animations include Shake, Rave, Roll, Spin, Slide In, and Slide Out. Viewers who are sensitive to animations will be able to turn off the feature in their Chat Settings. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161236" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161236" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2161236" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twitch-emote.gif?w=310" alt="" width="310" height="235" /><p id="caption-attachment-2161236" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitch</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch is also beta testing Follower Emotes, which will be available to select Partners and Affiliates. This feature creates a fun, free incentive for viewers to hit the follow button on a channel they might be checking out for the first time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When viewers follow a channel, they&#8217;ll be notified when the creator is streaming, which can lead to an eventual subscription. Twitch takes 50% of streamers&#8217; subscription money, creating a valuable revenue stream for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Q1 of 2021, Twitch viewership hit an all-time high, <a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492">growing 16.5%</a> since the previous quarter. Twitch viewers watched 6.34 billion hours of content in Q1, making up 72.3% of the market share. That&#8217;s double the total hours watched on Twitch in Q1 of 2020. Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming earned 12.1% and 15.6% of viewership in the sector respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a long time, creators have been asking for better ways to attract and welcome new viewers into their channel,” said Santana. “The idea is generally to create a lot of excitement around that community, and more feelings ultimately of community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creators with beta access will be able to upload up to five Emotes for their followers, but unlike Subscriber Emotes, followers won’t be able to use these across other channels. There’s no guarantee that Follower Emotes will be here to stay – Santana says it’s a feature Twitch is “experimenting” with – but if all goes well, the feature will roll out more widely later in the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Library function will make it easier for creators to to swap Emotes in and out of subscription tiers without having to delete and reupload them each time. This builds upon </span><a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/01/26/new-easy-emote-management-all-your-emotes-one-page/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an upgrade that launched in January</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which centralized channel-specific icons into an Emotes tab on the Creator Dashboard. As usual, new Emotes have to be approved by Twitch before they’re put into use. The Library will roll out soon to all Partners and Affiliates, staggered over a few months to account for an expected increase in volume of new Emotes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As Twitch has scaled, we now have millions of communities across many different cultures across the world,&#8221; Santana said. &#8220;We can hand over more of the controls of our Emote language to our community, and let them sort of evolve in a way that we never could imagine that ultimately serves them in their unique ways.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch teased that there’s more in the works to celebrate the platform’s 10th anniversary, including an official 10 Year celebration. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All things considered, Apple put together a pretty slick all-virtual WWDC last year. Where other companies like Microsoft and Google have opted for a more live (or live-style) experience, the company was parading its execs through a series of smooth drone shots and slick transitions. And with the first year under its belt, it will be fun to see how the company outdoes itself.</p>
<p>As far as news goes, the WWDC keynote kickoff is always packed &#8212; and this year is no different. In fact, there’s a good chance that we could see even more. In addition to the standard developer-focused updates to iOS/iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS and the like, we could well see some new hardware dropping at the event.</p>
<p>As ever, we’ll be breaking the news live, and this time out, we’re bringing back the liveblog. So, you know, lots of different ways to follow along live. The event kicks off at 10AM PT/1PM ET on Monday, June 7.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As usual, iOS is the tentpole attraction here &#8212; if nothing else, because Apple sells more iPhones than anything else. That was certainly the case last year, when the company’s latest 5G devices provided much needed relief in an otherwise flagging mobile market.</p>
<p>At least right off the bat, iOS 15 doesn’t look like as radical an update as the latest version of Android. But a lot can happen between today and Monday morning. The top line issue (at least for now) seems to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=gni836kR">updates to notifications</a>. According to reports, the new version of the mobile operating system will offer customizable notifications based on status &#8212; meaning things like sleeping, working and driving.</p>
<p>The operating system is also believed to be getting a whole slew of new accessibility features.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141177" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141177" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2141177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg" alt="Apple 2021 iPad Pro overview" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg 1904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141177" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Perhaps even bigger news is a long-awaited update to iPadOS 15. The dated software was a sticking point in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/review-apples-2021-ipad-pro-is-great-again-but/">our latest iPad Pro review</a>, and it seems the company is finally making some key strides to further distance its tablet operating system from the mobile one. For most intents and purposes, the current execution is effectively a scaled-up version of iOS for the tablet.</p>

<p>Not a ton of details yet, but the home screen is reportedly set to get some major updates, including widgets. One imagines the company will be pushing to make better use of all that added real estate. It should also be getting some of the new iOS updates, including those new notifications and a big overhaul for iMessage.</p>

<p>After the big overhaul that was Big Sur, we’re expecting smaller waves from macOS 12. The big news here may be hardware. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15">Rumors surround</a> an update to Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip. The M1X (as it’s currently being called) could well arrive alongside brand new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, which would finally put a little sunlight between the high and low end of Apple’s laptop line.</p>

<p>Also, watchOS seems due for a big update, even if information is pretty scant so far. New health features are always a sure bet &#8212; especially now that Apple is competing with the newly combined Google and Fitbit (not to mention that recently announced assist from Samsung).</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s<a href="https://twitter.com/jlacort/status/1400007637090111494?s=20"> homeOS,</a> the most intriguing mystery of the bunch. Job listings have pointed to the mysterious operating system &#8212; that could have just been a typo (later changed to &#8220;HomePod&#8221; in the listing).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141067" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141067" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2141067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg 1894w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141067" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>This being a rumor roundup, we&#8217;ll point the compelling possibility that it might be something larger &#8212; perhaps a more unifying home operating system designed to work with existing and forthcoming Apple home products. Perhaps something that integrates a bit more closely with tvOS. A longstanding rumor centers around a new Apple TV device, but so far we&#8217;ve not seen a lot of confirmation on that front.</p>
<p>Other rumors involve a new Mac Mini (though we just saw a refresh late last year). Rumors around <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/">Beats Studio Buds </a>are enticing as well. After all, when LeBron is seen <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/lebron-james-beats-studio-buds/">sporting your unannounced hardware</a>, people are going to talk. Traditionally, however, Apple has opted to let the Beats team do its own announcements, saving these big events for its own self-branded audio products like AirPods.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M8szlSa-8o">There’s no crying in baseball</a>, and there are certainly no shortcuts in building a successful startup. But, thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=5reasonspost">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a> on July 8-9, you don’t have to reinvent the freakin’ wheel.</p>
<p>This two-day bootcamp offers early-stage founders (pre-seed through Series A) access to the startup ecosystem’s leading experts and top investors. They’ll host a series of interactive Q&amp;A sessions focused on essential topics, like pitch development, fundraising, brand building, growth marketing and more. Take <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=5reasonspost#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">a peek at the agenda</a>.</p>
<p>Here are just some of the many reasons to carve time out of your hectic schedule and attend this all-virtual event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>1. Because your contemporaries say so</h2>
<p>&#8220;Early Stage 2020 was a great opportunity to hear seasoned startup founders talking about their experiences and how they dealt with many of the same challenges I faced then and am going through now. It’s like a mini masterclass in entrepreneurship.&#8221; — Ashley Barrington, founder, MarketPearl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sequoia Capital’s session, &#8216;Start with Your Customer,&#8217; looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. I took the idea to my team and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.&#8221; — Chloe Leaaetoa, founder, Socicraft.</p>
<h2>2. Connect with community and opportunity</h2>
<p>Founding a startup can be a frustrating and sometimes lonely affair. It helps to bounce ideas off other early founders who know exactly what you’re going through. You never know where those communal connections might lead, and a fat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolodex">Rolodex</a> is always good for business.</p>
<p>Make ad hoc connections in our virtual platform’s chat feature. Want a more strategic tool? CrunchMatch, our AI-powered networking platform, simplifies finding and scheduling 1:1 meetings with the people who align with your business goals.</p>
<h2>3. Bust out the breakout sessions</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll learn a ton about growing your business at interactive Q&amp;A sessions like these:</p>
<p><strong>Iterating More Effectively with Feedback:</strong> A great product alone is not enough. To be successful, early-stage companies need to optimize all phases of the customer journey. This session will include tactics, best practices and case studies on how to use customer feedback to understand customer needs, craft more compelling messaging and improve all phases of the customer experience.</p>
<p><strong><span class="schedule-item__title">Growth Hacking, Product Fit and Pricing: </span></strong><span class="schedule-item__description">Superhuman’s Rahul Vohra shares strategies for early-stage founders on topics like hacking your way to product-market fit, driving user sign-ups without breaking the bank on paid ads and identifying your product’s price point.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="schedule-item__title">How to Determine Your Earned Media Strategy: </span></strong><span class="schedule-item__description">Learn how to build an effective earned media strategy for your startup, building on Rebecca Reeve Henderson&#8217;s deep expertise developing effective communications programs for some of the top business software companies in the world. Earned media, aka the kind of exposure you get from a TechCrunch article, is a key element of any startup’s marketing strategy, but it’s also one of the trickiest things to get right. Rebecca has worked with companies ranging from Slack, to Shopify, to Zapier, to Canva and many more, helping craft effective earned media strategies in one of the most difficult areas of all: B2B SaaS.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">And even more&#8230;.</a></p>
<h2>4. Pitch at TC Early Stage</h2>
<p>Day two is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/applications-for-the-tc-early-stage-pitch-off-july-are-open/">all about the pitch-off</a>. Ten early-stage startups will take the virtual stage and deliver their best five-minute pitch to a global audience of investors, TC editors, press and event attendees. A five-minute Q&amp;A with the judges follows that pitch. Want a shot? Get moving because you need to <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/N4qcpnuC">apply here</a> by June 7!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For all that&#8217;s said about fundraising and working alongside investors, rarely do we get to see founders and their investors in candid conversation with one another. Extra Crunch Live is changing that. On the weekly live show, we sit down with founders and the VCs who funded them to talk about how they came together on the deal, what stood out about the other party that led to their commitment and how they operate today. We also (usually) take a walk through their early pitch decks to get a feel for how success starts.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Emergence&#8217;s Lotti Siniscalco and Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong to discuss all that and more.

					<description><![CDATA[The BNPL space is flush with consumer interest but not yet awash in profits as major players battle one another for global spend share with a glut of smaller startups hot on their heels.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capitalists continue to fund buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) startups, evidence of ongoing optimism regarding not only e-commerce, but the specific model for financing consumer purchases as well.</p>
<p>Evidence of continued investor confidence in the BNPL space cropped up several times in the second quarter. Divido, a startup that TechCrunch described as a &#8220;white-label [BNPL] platform for retail finance that integrates with e-commerce platforms,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/divido-bags-30m-to-take-its-buy-now-pay-later-platform-to-more-markets/">raised $30 million</a>. And Zilch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uks-zilch-raises-80m-at-a-500m-valuation-for-its-direct-to-consumer-buy-now-pay-later-service/">raised $80 million</a> for an &#8220;over-the-top&#8221; BNPL solution.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Zilch is now worth $800 million.</p>
<p>There are other examples, but those will suffice to get us into the correct mindset for today&#8217;s work as we look back at data points regarding the financial performance of more mature BNPL tech companies. So, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">as in February</a> when we were looking at Q4 2020 numbers, today we&#8217;re looking into the more recent performance of Klarna, Affirm and Afterpay.</p>

<p>As startups scale, they focus a bit more on profitability. Super-early-stage startups aren&#8217;t often too worried about net margins, for example, as their revenues can be nascent and their costs rising as they staff up for a product launch or another similar event.</p>
<p>But as those same startups mature into unicorn territory, questions about their model&#8217;s profitability on a unit basis, operating cash burn and aggregate profitability will start to pop up. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/28/how-to-estimate-a-companys-health-without-really-trying/">The Rule of 40</a> is a startup rubric for a reason.</p>
<p>And in the cases of Affirm and Afterpay, we&#8217;re in fact examining public companies. So we can safely care even more about their profitability than we might if they, like Klarna, were still waiting for an IPO.</p>
<p>For each, then, we&#8217;ll consider growth and profitability. Let&#8217;s start with <strong>Klarna</strong>:</p>
<p>Klarna&#8217;s <a href="https://www.klarna.com/assets/sites/15/2021/05/28054804/Financial-Update-Q1-2021.pdf">latest data</a>, dealing with Q1 2021, breaks down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global GMV of $18.9 billion, +91% compared to the year-ago result.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is facing a fresh pair of antitrust probes in Europe.</p>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and the EU&#8217;s Competition Commission both announced formal investigations into the social media giant&#8217;s operations today &#8212; with what&#8217;s likely to have been coordinated timing.</p>
<p>The competition regulators will scrutinize how Facebook uses data from advertising customers and users of its single sign-on tool &#8212; specifically looking at whether it uses this data as an unfair lever against competitors in markets such as classified ads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pair also said they will seek to work closely together as their independent investigations progress.</p>
<p>With the U.K. outside the European trading bloc (post-Brexit), the national competition watchdog has a freer rein to pursue investigations that may be similar to or overlap with antitrust probes the EU is also undertaking.</p>
<p>And the two Facebook investigations do appear similar on the surface &#8212; with both broadly focused on how Facebook uses advertising data. (Though outcomes could of course differ.)</p>
<p>The danger for Facebook, here, is that a higher dimension of scrutiny will be applied to its business as a result of dual regulatory action &#8212; with the opportunity for joint working and cross-referencing of its responses (not to mention a little investigative competition between the U.K. and the EU&#8217;s agencies).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-investigates-facebook-s-use-of-ad-data">CMA</a> said it&#8217;s looking at whether Facebook has gained an unfair advantage over competitors in providing services for online classified ads and online dating through how it gathers and uses certain data.</p>
<p>Specifically, the U.K.&#8217;s regulator said it&#8217;s concerned that Facebook might have gained an unfair advantage over competitors providing services for online classified ads and online dating.</p>
<p>Facebook plays in both spaces of course, via Facebook Marketplace and Facebook Dating, respectively.</p>
<p>In a statement on its action, CMA CEO Andrea Coscelli said: &#8220;We intend to thoroughly investigate Facebook’s use of data to assess whether its business practices are giving it an unfair advantage in the online dating and classified ad sectors. Any such advantage can make it harder for competing firms to succeed, including new and smaller businesses, and may reduce customer choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The European Commission&#8217;s investigation will &#8212; similarly &#8212; focus on whether Facebook violated the EU&#8217;s competition rules by using advertising data gathered from advertisers in order to compete with them in markets where it is active.</p>
<p>Although it only cites classified ads as its example of the neighbouring market of particular concern for its probe.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s probe has another element, though, as it said it&#8217;s also looking at whether Facebook ties its online classified ads service to its social network in breach of the bloc&#8217;s competition rules.</p>
<p>In a separate (national) action, Germany&#8217;s competition authority opened a similar probe into Facebook tying Oculus to use of a Facebook account at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts/">end of last year</a>. So Facebook now has multiple antitrust probes on its plate in Europe, adding to its woes from the massive states antitrust lawsuit filed against it on home turf, also back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">December 2020</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bdzzKS72FW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">Facebook hit with massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 states</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook hit with massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 states&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/embed/#?secret=bdzzKS72FW" data-secret="bdzzKS72FW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;When advertising their services on Facebook, companies, which also compete directly with Facebook, may provide it commercially valuable data. Facebook might then use this data in order to compete against the companies which provided it,&#8221; the Commission noted in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2848">press release</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This applies in particular to online classified ads providers, the platforms on which many European consumers buy and sell products. Online classified ads providers advertise their services on Facebook&#8217;s social network. At the same time, they compete with Facebook&#8217;s own online classified ads service, &#8216;Facebook Marketplace&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission added that a preliminary investigation it already undertook has raised concerns Facebook is distorting the market for online classified ads services. It will now take an in-depth look in order to make a full judgement on whether the social media behemoth is breaking EU competition rules.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, EVP Margrethe Vestager, who also heads up competition policy for the bloc, added: “Facebook is used by almost 3 billion people on a monthly basis and almost 7 million firms advertise on Facebook in total. Facebook collects vast troves of data on the activities of users of its social network and beyond, enabling it to target specific customer groups. We will look in detail at whether this data gives Facebook an undue competitive advantage in particular on the online classified ads sector, where people buy and sell goods every day, and where Facebook also competes with companies from which it collects data. In today&#8217;s digital economy, data should not be used in ways that distort competition.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Reached for comment on the latest European antitrust probes, Facebook sent us this statement:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>We are always developing new and better services to meet evolving demand from people who use Facebook. Marketplace and Dating offer people more choices and both products operate in a highly competitive environment with many large incumbents. We will continue to cooperate fully with the investigations to demonstrate that they are without merit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Up til now, Facebook has been a bit of a blind spot for the Commission&#8217;s competition authority &#8212; with multiple investigations and enforcements chalked up by the bloc against other tech giants, such as (most notably) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/europe-lays-out-antitrust-case-against-amazons-use-of-big-data/">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>But Vestager&#8217;s Facebook &#8220;dry patch&#8221; has now formally come to an end. (The EU&#8217;s informal investigation into Facebook Marketplace had been ongoing since March 2019.)</p>
<p>The CMA, meanwhile, is working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">wider pro-competition regulatory reforms</a> aimed squarely at tech giants like Facebook and Google under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">a U.K. plan to clip the wings of the adtech duopoly</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Guest articles are hugely popular with our startup audience — if the topics are right.</p>
<p>Prospective authors regularly ask us about which topics Extra Crunch subscribers would like to hear more about. Here are some pointers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How-tos:</strong> Generally, early-stage founders want the latest useful information about how to create a company, including fundraising, growth and team-building. What has been changing in your area of expertise that would surprise people who have done a startup or two before?</li>
<li><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Market analysis:</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Our readers want to learn more about the latest developments in emerging technology sectors from people who have some sort of special viewpoint into the action. They want comprehensive posts that paint a clear picture of the companies, products and services that characterize individual tech sectors today. The focus can range from tech being applied to old-line industries or being used to create entirely new categories.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Ideas? Submit to <a href="mailto:guestcolumns@techcrunch.com">guestcolumns@techcrunch.com</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, we are especially interested in submissions from authors who have expertise in the following subtopics:</p>
<h2>Growth marketing</h2>
<p>By definition, nearly every startup that has figured out its product-market fit is trying to grow fast. Our audience always wants to hear the latest ideas that they might be able to apply, too. Whether it&#8217;s related to SEO, content, email, social or other marketing channels, they&#8217;re looking for granular advice that can help them find and engage the right users. <strong>Founders and investors who have growth marketing experience will go to the front of the line.</strong></p>
<h2>Alternative fundraising</h2>
<p>We cover a lot of venture capital, naturally, but we have also been covering the rise of alternative fundraising over the years, including revenue-based investing, crowdfunding, social and beyond. Founders in search of funding are generally open to new ideas and iterations, particularly from other founders and experts who are pioneering effective new concepts.</p>
<h2>Quality of life</h2>
<p>Tech has infused all parts of our lives and promises better answers for the physical world around us. But the hopes of today, from personal well-being to the prosperity of cities to a sustainable planet, often feel out of reach. We are especially eager for emerging solutions from industry experts in personal health, housing and transportation, and environmental and climate topics.</p>
<p>One final note: We only publish a handful of columns each week on Extra Crunch given our other editorial initiatives, but we would like to do more — especially with domain experts who are interested in contributing on a recurring basis. When working with repeat authors, we will also publish one-off articles about public-interest topics on TechCrunch without a paywall.</p>

<p>Hello Equity podcast family, we&#8217;re back with another survey.</p>
<p>This is our second go-round with collecting your feedback, notes and vibes.</p>
<p>The first survey we conducted back in the early days of 2020 was super useful in helping us better tune the show. Since then, Equity has grown in frequency and we&#8217;ve expanded our production team. So, it&#8217;s a perfect time to collect your opinions. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd96e0oKV6OPcilUHgSIJBnNuD7_GNcnFCqnk1RveUNuBJojQ/viewform?usp=sf_link"><strong>You can find the survey here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If you have listened to the show a few times, or if you listen every week, or if you&#8217;ve heard a few hundred episodes, we want to hear from you.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re going to offer some sort of neat reward to a lucky participant. Think things like TechCrunch socks. Or a romantic dinner for you and your partner that Danny cooks. Or Alex may call the person of your choosing to tell them that they have very poor gross margins.</p>
<p>The gist is that we are hungry for your feedback and are willing to pay for the 37 to 94 seconds it will take you to fill out our little Google Form.</p>
<p>We appreciate you, and the time you spend with us. (But really, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd96e0oKV6OPcilUHgSIJBnNuD7_GNcnFCqnk1RveUNuBJojQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">take the darn survey</a>!)</p>
<p>&#8212; The Equity Team</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Grupo Bursátil Mexicano (GBM) is a 35-year-old investment platform in the Mexican stock market. In its first three decades of life, GBM was focused on providing investment services to high net worth individuals and local and global institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past decade, the Mexico City-based brokerage has ramped up its digital efforts, and, in the past five years, has evolved its business model to offer services to all Mexicans with the same products and services it offers large estates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today, GBM is announcing it has received an investment of “up to” $150 million from SoftBank via the Japanese conglomerate’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/softbank-launches-the-innovation-fund-committing-2b-to-invest-in-latin-america/">Latin America Fund</a> at a valuation of “over $1 billion.” The investment is being made through one of GBM’s subsidiaries and is not contingent on anything, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Co-CEO Pedro de Garay Montero told TechCrunch that GBM has built an app, GBM+, that organizes and invests clients’ money through three different tools: Wealth Management, Trading and Smart Cash.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last year was a “historic” one for the company, he said, and GBM went from having 38,000 investment accounts in January 2020 to more than 650,000 by year’s end. In the first quarter of 2021, that number had grown to over 1 million &#8212; representing more than 30x growth from the beginning of 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For some context, according to the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV), there were only 298,000 brokerage accounts in Mexico at the end of 2019, and that number climbed to 940,000 by the end of 2020 &#8212; with GBM holding a large share of them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most of GBM’s clients are retail clients, but the company also caters to “most of the largest investment managers worldwide,” as well as global companies such as Netflix, Google and BlackRock. Specifically, it services 40% of the largest public corporations in Mexico and a large base of ultra high net worth individuals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is planning to use its new capital in part to invest “heavily” in customer acquisition.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Montero said that half of its team of 450 are tech professionals, and that the company plans to also continue hiring as it focuses on growth in its B2C and B2B offerings and expanding into new verticals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are improving our already robust financial education offering,” he added, “so that Mexicans can take control of their finances. GBM’s mission is to transform Mexico into a country of investors.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Because Mexico is such a huge market &#8212; with a population of over 120 million and a GDP of more than $1 trillion &#8212; GBM is laser-focused on growing its presence in the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The financial services industry is dominated by big banks and is inefficient, expensive and provides a poor client experience. This has resulted in less than 1% of individuals having an investment account,&#8221; Montero told TechCrunch. “We will be targeting clients through our own platform and internal advisors, as well as growing our base of external advisors to reach as many people as possible with the best investment products and user experience.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When it comes to institutional clients, he believes there is “enormous potential” in serving both the large corporations and the SMEs “who have received limited services from banks.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Juan Franck, Investment lead and head of Mexico for SoftBank Latin America Fund, believes the retail investment space in Mexico is at an inflection point.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The investing culture in Mexico has historically been low compared to the rest of the world, even when specifically compared to other countries in Latin America, like Brazil,” he added. “However, the landscape is quickly changing as, through technology, Mexicans are being provided more education around investing and more investment alternatives.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the midst of this shift, SoftBank was impressed by GBM&#8217;s “clear vision and playbook,” Franck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, despite being a decades-old company, SoftBank sees big potential in the strength of the digital platform that GBM has built out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“GBM is the leading broker in Mexico in terms of trading activity and broker accounts,” he said. “The company combines decades of industry know-how with an entrepreneurial drive to revolutionize the wealth management space in the country.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SentinelOne, a late-stage security startup that helps organizations secure their data using AI and machine learning, has filed for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ipo/">IPO</a> on the New York Stock Exchange (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nyse/">NYSE</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1583708/000162828021011624/sentineloneincs-1initialpu.htm">an S-1 filing on Thursday</a>, the security company revealed that for the three months ending April 30, its revenues increased by 108% year-on-year to $37.4 million and its customer base grew to 4,700, up from 2,700 a year prior. Despite this pandemic-fueled growth, SentinelOne&#8217;s net losses more than doubled from $26.6 million in 2020 to $62.6 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to invest for our future growth, including expanding our research and development function to drive further development of our platform, expanding our sales and marketing activities, developing the functionality to expand into adjacent markets, and reaching customers in new geographic locations,” SentinelOne wrote in its filing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Mountain View-based company said it intends to list its Class A common stock using the ticker symbol “S” and that details about the price range and number of common shares to be put up for the IPO are yet to be determined. The S-1 filing also identifies Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Securities, Barclays and Wells Fargo Securities as the lead underwriters.</p>
<p>SentinelOne <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/sentinelone-an-ai-based-endpoint-security-firm-confirms-267m-raise-on-a-3-1b-valuation/">raised $276 million in a funding round in November last year</a>, tripling its $1 billion valuation from February 2020 to $3 billion. At the time, CEO and founder Tomer Weingarten told TechCrunch that an IPO “would be the next logical step” for the company.</p>
<p>SentinelOne, which was founded in 2013 and has raised a total of $696.5 million through eight rounds of funding, is looking to raise up to $100 million in its IPO, and said it&#8217;s intending to use the net proceeds to increase its visibility in the cybersecurity marketplace and for product development and other &#8220;general corporate processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>It added that it “may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions, or businesses that complement our business.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The company&#8217;s sole acquisition so far took place back in February </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/sentinelone-an-ai-based-endpoint-security-firm-confirms-267m-raise-on-a-3-1b-valuation/">when it bought high-speed logging startup Scalyr for $155 million</a>.</p>
<p>SentinelOne is going public during a period of heightened public interest in cybersecurity. There has been a wave of high-profile cyberattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, with hackers taking advantage of widespread remote working necessitated as a result.</p>
<p>One of the biggest attacks saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">Russian hackers breach the networks of IT company SolarWinds</a>, enabling them to gain access to government agencies and corporations. SentinelOne&#8217;s endpoint protection solution was able to detect and stop the related malicious payload, protecting its customers.</p>
<p>“The world is full of criminals, state actors, and other hostile agents who seek to exfiltrate and exploit data to disrupt our way of life,” Weingarten said in SentinelOne’s SEC filing. “Our mission is to keep the world running by protecting and securing the core pillars of modern infrastructure: data and the systems that store, process, and share information. This is an endless mission as attackers evolve rapidly in their quest to disrupt operations, breach data, turn profit, and inflict damage.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <em>Bundeskartellamt</em>, Germany&#8217;s very active competition authority, isn&#8217;t letting the grass grow under new powers it gained this year to tackle big tech: The Federal Cartel Office (FCO) has just <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2021/04_06_2021_Google_Showcase.html">announced</a> a third proceeding against Google.</p>
<p>The FCO&#8217;s latest competition probe looks very interesting as it&#8217;s targeting Google News Showcase &#8212; Google&#8217;s relatively recently launched<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> product which curates a selection of third party publishers&#8217; content to appear in story panels on Google News (and other Google properties), content for which the tech giant pays a licensing fee.</span></p>
<p>Google started cutting content licensing deals with publishers around the world for News Showcase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/">last year</a>, announcing a total pot of $1BN to fund the arrangements &#8212; with Germany one of the first markets where it inked deals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However its motivation to pay publishers to licence their journalism is hardly pure.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UwJJDA56m1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/">Google to pay out $1B to publishers to license content for new Google News Showcase</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google to pay out $1B to publishers to license content for new Google News Showcase&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/embed/#?secret=UwJJDA56m1" data-secret="UwJJDA56m1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It follows years of bitter accusations from media companies that Google is freeloading off their content. To which the tech giant routinely responded with stonewalling statements &#8212; saying it would never pay for content because that&#8217;s not how online aggregation works. It also tried to fob off the industry with a digital innovation fund (aka <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/intl/en_gb/">Google News Initiative</a>) which distributes small grants and offers free workshops and product advice, seeking to frame publishers&#8217; decimated business models as a failure of innovation, leaving Google&#8217;s adtech machine scot free to steamroller on.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s stonewalling-plus-chicken-feeding approach worked to stave off regulatory action for a long time but eventually enough political pressure built up around the issue of media business models vs the online advertising duopoly that legislators started to make moves to try to address the power imbalance between traditional publishers and intermediating tech giants.</p>
<p>Most infamously in Australia, where lawmakers passed a news media bargaining code <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its passage, both Facebook and Google, the twin targets for that law, warned the move could result in dire consequences &#8212; such as a total shut down of their products, reduced quality or even fees to use their services.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZM40ar74ft"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">After Facebook&#8217;s news flex, Australia passes bargaining code for platforms and publishers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After Facebook&#8217;s news flex, Australia passes bargaining code for platforms and publishers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/embed/#?secret=ZM40ar74ft" data-secret="ZM40ar74ft" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nothing like that happened but lawmakers did agree to a last minute amendment &#8212; adding a two-month mediation period to the legislation which allows digital platforms and publishers to strike deals on their own before having to enter into forced arbitration.</p>
<p>Critics say that allows for the two tech giants to continue to set their own terms when dealmaking with publishers, leveraging market muscle to strike deals that may disproportionately benefit Australia&#8217;s largest media firms &#8212; and doing so without any external oversight and with no guarantees that the resulting content arrangements foster media diversity and plurality or even support quality journalism.</p>
<p>In the EU, lawmakers acted earlier &#8212; taking the controversial route of extending copyright to cover snippets of news content <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">back in 2019</a>. (And Monday June 7 is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1807">deadline for Member States</a> to have transposed the rules into national law.)</p>
<p>France was among the first EU countries to bake the provision into national law &#8212; and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">competition watchdog quickly ordered Google to pay for news reuse</a> back in 2020 after Google tried to wiggle out of the legislation by stopping displaying snippets in the market.</p>
<p>It responded to the competition authority&#8217;s order with more obfuscation, though, agreeing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/">earlier this year</a> to pay French publishers for content reuse but also for their participation in News Showcase &#8212; bundling required-by-law payments (for news reuse) with content licensing deals of its own devising. And thereby making it difficult to understand the balance of mandatory payments vs commercial arrangements.</p>
<p>The problem with News Showcase is that these licensing arrangements are being done behind closed doors, in many cases ahead of relevant legislation and thus purely on Google&#8217;s terms &#8212; which means the initiative risks exacerbating concerns about the power imbalance between it and traditional publishers caught in a revenue bind as their business models have been massively disrupted by the switch to digital.</p>
<p>If Google suddenly offers some money for content, plenty of publishers might well jump &#8212; regardless of the terms. And perhaps especially because any publishers that hold out against licensing content to Google at the price it likes risk being disadvantaged by reduced visibility for their content, given Google&#8217;s dominance of the search market and content discoverability (via its ability to direct traffic to specific media properties, such as based on how prominently News Showcase content is displayed, for example).</p>
<p>The competition implications look clear.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s still impressive that the <em>Bundeskartellamt </em>is spinning up an investigation into News Showcase so quickly.</p>
<p>The FCO said it&#8217;s acting on a complaint from Corint Media &#8212; looking at whether the announced integration of the Google News Showcase service into Google’s general search function is &#8220;likely to constitute self-preferencing or an impediment to the services offered by competing third parties&#8221;.</p>
<p>It also said it&#8217;s looking at whether contractual conditions include unreasonable terms (&#8220;to the detriment of the participating publishers&#8221;); and, in particular, &#8220;make it disproportionately difficult for them to enforce the ancillary copyright for press publishers introduced by the German Bundestag and Bundesrat in May 2021&#8221; &#8212; a reference to the transposed neighbouring right for news in the EU copyright reform.</p>
<p>So it will be examining the core issue of whether Google is trying to use News Showcase to undermine the new EU rights publishers gained under the copyright reform.</p>
<p>The FCO also said it wants to look at &#8220;how the conditions for access to Google’s News Showcase service are defined&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google launched the News Showcase in Germany on October 1 2020, with an initial 20 media companies participating &#8212; covering 50 publications. Although more have been added since.</p>
<p>Per the FCO, the News Showcase &#8216;story panels&#8217; were initially integrated in the Google News app but can now also be found in Google News on the desktop. It also notes that Google has said the panels will soon also appear in the general Google search results &#8212; a move that will further dial up the competition dynamics around the product, given Google&#8217;s massive dominance of the search market in Europe.</p>
<p>Commenting on its proceeding in a statement, Andreas Mundt, president of the Bundeskartellamt, said: &#8220;Cooperating with Google can be an attractive option for publishers and other news providers and offer consumers new or improved information services. However, it must be ensured that this will not result in discrimination between individual publishers. In addition, Google’s strong position in providing access to end customers must not lead to a situation where competing services offered by publishers or other news providers are squeezed out of the market. There must be an adequate balance between the rights and obligations of the content providers participating in Google’s programme.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google was contacted for comment on the FCO&#8217;s action &#8212; and it sent us this statement, attributed to spokesperson, Kay Oberbeck:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Showcase is one of many ways Google supports journalism, <a href="https://blog.google/supportingnews#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/supportingnews%23overview&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622890337552000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-AiwTikaxXr1BH5JvqTVAFdWAkA">building on products and funds</a> that all publishers can benefit from. Showcase is an international licensing program for news &#8212; the selection of partners is based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria, and partner content is not given preference in the ranking of our results. We will cooperate fully with the German Competition Authority and look forward to answering their questions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The FCO&#8217;s scrutiny of Google News Showcase, follows hard on the heels of two other Google proceedings it opened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">last month</a>, one to determine whether or not the tech giant meets the threshold of Germany&#8217;s new competition powers for tackling big tech &#8212; and another examining its data processing practices. Both remain ongoing.</p>
<p>The competition authority has also recently opened a proceeding<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/amazons-market-power-to-be-tested-in-germany-in-push-for-early-action-over-antitrust-risks/"> into Amazon&#8217;s market dominance</a> &#8212; and is also looking to extend another recent investigation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/facebook-hit-with-antitrust-probe-for-tying-oculus-use-to-facebook-accounts/">Facebook&#8217;s Oculus business</a>, also by determining whether the social media giant&#8217;s business meets the threshold required under the new law.</p>
<p>The amendment to the German Competition Act came into force in January &#8212; giving the FCO greater powers to proactively impose conditions on large digital companies who are considered to be of “paramount significance for competition across markets” in order to pre-emptively control the risk of market abuse.</p>
<p>That it&#8217;s taking on so many proceedings in parallel against big tech shows it&#8217;s keen not to waste any time &#8212; putting itself in a position to come, as quickly as possible, with proactive interventions to address competitive problems caused by platform giants just as soon as it determines it can legally do that.</p>
<p>The <em>Bundeskartellamt </em>also has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/competition-challenge-to-facebooks-superprofiling-of-users-sparks-referral-to-europes-top-court/">pioneering case against Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;superprofiling&#8217;</a> on its desk &#8212; which links privacy abuse to competition concerns and could drastically limit the tech giant&#8217;s ability to profile users. That investigation and case has been ongoing for years but was recently referred to Europe&#8217;s top court for an interpretation of key legal questions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indonesian healthcare startup <a href="https://www.prixa.ai/">Prixa</a> has raised $3 million led by MDI Ventures and the Trans-Pacific Technology Fund (TPTF), with participation from returning investors including Siloam Hospitals Group.</p>
<p>This brings Prixa’s total raised to $4.5 million since it launched in 2019. Co-founder and chief executive officer James Roring M.D., told TechCrunch in an email that the new funding will enable Prixa to scale its platform and customer base. Prixa uses a B2B model, partnering with healthcare payers like insurance providers and corporations. Through its B2B customers, it currently serves about 10 million patients.</p>
<p>Prixa currently works with four major insurers and has six additional insurers in its short-term pipeline. It also works with Indonesia’s largest third-party administrators, Roring said, allowing it to reach more policyholders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prixa’s platform includes a digital health assistant to answer patients&#8217; questions, telemedicine consultations, pharmacy deliveries and on-demand lab diagnostics. Usage increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as more patients sought online consultations for primary care.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jP98KUdtDB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/telemedicine-startups-are-positioning-themselves-for-a-post-pandemic-world/">Telemedicine startups are positioning themselves for a post-pandemic world</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Telemedicine startups are positioning themselves for a post-pandemic world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/telemedicine-startups-are-positioning-themselves-for-a-post-pandemic-world/embed/#?secret=jP98KUdtDB" data-secret="jP98KUdtDB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Other telehealth startups in Indonesia include Halodoc and Alodokter (which is also backed by MDI). Both connect patients directly with healthcare and insurance providers. Roring said Prixa differentiates by focusing on greater cost control for healthcare payers and positioning itself as a digital primary care platform.</p>
<p>“By symptomatically managing patients outside of tertiary care facilities and caring for chronic non-communicable diseases online, Prixa is able to effectively reduce the amount of outpatient claims and downstream inpatient cost incurred by healthcare payers,” Roring said. “Additionally, the combination of a growing and robust medical database, as well as proven clinical guidelines, contribute to cost efficiency and service optimization through the standardization of treatment by our healthcare providers.”</p>
<p>In press statement about the funding, Aditia Henri Narendra, MDI Ventures’ general manager of legal and corporate communication, said, “MDI co-led this financing because Prixa has demonstrated its ability to support insurance companies and hospitals in making medical services more accessible and affordable through its AI telemedicine platform.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">An email has been going around the internet as a part of a release of documents related to Apple’s App Store based suit brought by Epic Games. I love this email for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that you can extrapolate from it the very reasons Apple has remained such a vital force in the industry for the past decade.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The gist of it is that SVP of Software Engineering, Bertrand Serlet, sent an email in October of 2007, just three months after the iPhone was launched. In the email, Serlet outlines essentially every core feature of Apple’s App Store — a business that brought in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/apples-app-store-had-gross-sales-around-64-billion-in-2020.html">estimated $64B</a> in 2020. And that, more importantly, allowed the launch of countless titanic internet startups and businesses built on and taking advantage of native apps on iPhone.</p>
<p class="p1">Forty five minutes after the email, Steve Jobs replies to Serlet and iPhone lead Scott Forstall, from his iPhone, “Sure, as long as we can roll it all out at Macworld on Jan 15, 2008.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Apple University should have a course dedicated to this email.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Here it is, shared by an account I enjoy, Internal Tech Emails, on Twitter. If you run the account let me know, happy to credit you further here if you wish:</p>
<p class="p1">
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bertrand Serlet to Steve Jobs: &quot;Fine, let&#39;s enable Cocoa Touch apps&quot;</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">October 2, 2007 <a href="https://t.co/9aTxmjgkRS">pic.twitter.com/9aTxmjgkRS</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Internal Tech Emails (@TechEmails) <a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1400270458608664577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
</p>
<p class="p1">First, we have Serlet’s outline. It’s seven sentences that outline the key tenets of the App Store. User protection, network protection, an owned developer platform and a sustainable API approach. There is a direct ask for resources — whoever we need in software engineering — to get it shipped ASAP.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">It also has a clear ask at the bottom, ‘do you agree with these goals?’</p>
<p class="p1">Enough detail is included in the parentheticals to allow an informed reader to infer scope and work hours. And at no point during this email does Serlet include an <i>ounce</i> of <i>justification</i> for these choices. These are the obvious and necessary framework, in his mind, for accomplishing the rollout of an SDK for iPhone developers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">There is no extensive rationale provided for each item, something that is often unnecessary in an informed context and can often act as psychic baggage that telegraphs one of two things:</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1">You don’t believe the leader you’re outlining the project to knows what the hell they’re talking about.</li>
<li class="li1">You don’t believe it and you’re still trying to convince yourself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Neither one of those is the wisest way to provide an initial scope of work. There is plenty of time down the line to flesh out rationale to those who have less command of the larger context.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">If you’re a historian of iPhone software development, you’ll know that developer Nullriver had released Installer, a third-party installer that allowed apps to be natively loaded onto iPhone, in the summer of 2007. Early September, I believe. It was followed in 2008 by the eventually far more popular Cydia. And there were developers that August and September already experimenting with this completely unofficial way of getting apps on the store, like the <a href="https://furbo.org/2007/09/11/silence-is-golden/">venerable Twitterific </a>by Craig Hockenberry and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnBFF8QmEgo">Lights Off</a> by Lucas Newman and Adam Betts.</p>
<p class="p1">Though there has been plenty of established documentation of Steve being reluctant about allowing third-party apps on iPhone, this email establishes an official timeline for when the decision was not only made but essentially fully formed. And it’s much earlier than the apocryphal discussion about when the call was made. This is just weeks after the first hacky third-party attempts had made their way to iPhone and just under two months since the first <a href="https://blog.iconfactory.com/2018/03/a-lot-can-happen-in-a-decade/">iPhone jailbreak toolchain</a> appeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">There is no need or desire shown here for Steve to ‘make sure’ that his touch is felt on this framework. All too often I see leaders that are obsessed with making sure that they give feedback and input at every turn. Why did you hire those people in the first place? Was it for their skill and acumen? Their attention to detail? Their obsessive desire to get things right?</p>
<p class="p1">Then let them do their job.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Serlet’s email is well written and has the exact right scope, yes. But the response is just as important. A demand of what is likely too short a timeline (the App Store was eventually announced in March of 2008 and shipped in July of that year) sets the bar high — matching the urgency of the request for all teams to work together on this project. This is not a side alley, it’s the foundation of a main thoroughfare. It must get built before anything goes on top.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This efficacy is at the core of what makes Apple good when it is good. It’s not always good, but nothing ever is 100% of the time and the hit record is incredibly strong across a decade’s worth of shipped software and hardware. Crisp, lean communication that does not coddle or equivocate, coupled with a leader that is confident in their own ability and the ability of those that they hired means that there is no need to bog down the process in order to establish a record of involvement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">One cannot exist without the other. A clear, well argued RFP or project outline that is sent up to insecure or ineffective management just becomes fodder for territorial games or endless rounds of requests for clarification. And no matter how effective leadership is and how talented their employees, if they do not establish an environment in which clarity of thought is <i>welcomed and rewarded </i>then they will never get the kind of bold, declarative product development that they wish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">All in all, this exchange is a wildly important bit of ephemera that underpins the entire app ecosystem era and an explosive growth phase for Internet technology. And it’s also an encapsulation of the kind of environment that has made Apple an effective and brutally efficient company for so many years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Can it be learned from and emulated? Probably, but only if all involved are willing to create the environment necessary to foster the key elements above. Nine times out of ten you get moribund management, an environment that discourages blunt position taking and a muddy route to the exit. The tenth time, though, you get magic.</p>
<p class="p1">And, hey, maybe we can take this opportunity to make that next meeting an email?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery delivery, which really came into its own with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, continues to command huge attention from investors. The jury is still out on how people will use those services in the longer term, but in the meantime, the most ambitious of the startups in the field are raising big.</p>
<p>In the latest development, <a href="https://www.goflink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flink</a> &#8212; a Berlin-based on-demand &#8220;instant&#8221; grocery delivery service built around self-operated dark stores and a smaller assortment (2,400 items) that it says it will deliver in 10 minutes or less &#8212; has raised $240 million to expand its business into more cities, and more countries, on the heels of strong demand.</p>
<p>Flink &#8212; which means &#8220;quick&#8221; in German &#8212; is currently active in 24 cities across Germany, France and the Netherlands. It hasn&#8217;t disclosed how many active customers it has, but it targets younger consumers, those with small fridges, those who have forgotten items in their bigger shops, and people who simply don&#8217;t want to or can&#8217;t shop in the old-style of once every one or two weeks. Flink says it&#8217;s currently on a pace of activating operations in a new area every two days, it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are on a mission to give people back some of their valuable time during their hectic days and impress them with our service every time they order,&#8221; said Flink CEO Oliver Merkel &#8212; who co-founded the company with Julian Dames and Christoph Cordes &#8212; in a statement. &#8220;We want to establish Flink as the top destination for their day-to-day goods at great prices and with instant delivery by our amazing riders. The order growth we have seen over the past weeks has been explosive and we attribute that to the excellent service we are providing to our consumers.”</p>
<p>The size of this all-equity Series A is extraordinary considering that company only launched in December last year. The company is not disclosing its valuation but one person close to the company said it&#8217;s &#8220;not a unicorn yet.&#8221; (Not worth $1 billion on paper, that is.)</p>
<p>The round is being co-led by Prosus, BOND, and Mubadala Capital; and it comes with a very interesting deal attached.</p>
<p>REWE &#8212; a German supermarket giant &#8212; has inked a strategic partnership with the company that will make Flink its preferred partner for smaller shopping grabs, which looks like it will complement the work that REWE is doing to build out its own grocery delivery businesses for bigger baskets. It&#8217;s not clear if REWE is actually investing.</p>
<p>This latest investment comes on the heels of Flink announcing, back in March when it was only three months old, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$52 million round</a> from Target Global and earlier backers Northzone, Cherry Ventures and TriplePoint Capital, along with Cristina Stenbeck from Kinnevik, who invested in a personal capacity.</p>
<p>The opportunity for a new startup to get into the market for food &#8212; and in this case specifically grocery &#8212; delivery, is an interesting one at the moment.</p>
<p>On one hand, we&#8217;ve been through a year where many cities across Europe have been under shelter-in-place orders, pushing many more people to turn to online food ordering to get essential things delivered to their doors.</p>
<p>That is to say, demand &#8212; at least under current circumstances &#8212; has been more than proven out. In fact, many of the biggest providers completely buckled under pressure with crashing sites, very few or no delivery slots available and many items out of stock on a too-regular basis.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that situation has led to a huge profusion of companies swooping in to fill that gap. Perhaps too huge a profusion?</p>
<p>There are seemingly dozens of new players competing with Flick. Gorillas, another outfit out of Berlin, also been raising big money and has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasted its own $1 billion+ valuation</a> (for what it&#8217;s worth: remember, this is all just on paper). Alongside the new entrants of the last year are also a rush of more mature startups like Glovo (which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> raised $528 million earlier this year</a>), Kolonial (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/norways-kolonial-rebrands-as-oda-bags-265m-on-a-900m-valuation-to-grow-its-online-grocery-delivery-business-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$265 million earlier this year</a>), Everli and Rohlik (respectively, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/everli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100 million</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/czech-on-demand-grocery-delivery-startup-rohlik-bags-230m-to-expand-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $230 million rounds</a> this spring), as well as much bigger players like Ocado and of course the brick-and-mortar grocers who are investing big in their own operations.</p>
<p>And just earlier this morning, Getir out of Turkey, another fast-grocery startup that has been investing a lot in growth (its delivery bikes can be seen every time I go outside at the moment here in London) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3acc197c-cd81-4b3b-a19b-32e58fc687e7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a $550 million round at a $7.5 billion valuation</a> &#8212; a piece of news that may have been one part of the calculus for Flink also announcing today.</p>
<p>And there are so many more I&#8217;m not mentioning here.</p>
<p>The big question will be whether the market can sustain all of this, and if not, what that will mean for all of these, and all of the money invested in the space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unlike some of the scramble that took place in restaurant delivery, where we saw a slew regional giants appear (tapping into the growth of the web for e-commerce, and then spiffy apps to make ordering and for restaurants managing orders quick and easy). Then, the biggest of them moved to land grabs to pick up others near them to get better economies of scale &#8212; a process that eventually took the most well-capitalized of that smaller subset global. Then the bigger global players gobble the smaller, or merge to take on others.</p>
<p>All of that is actually still playing out, and in fact some of the biggest of the hot-food delivery companies, such as Deliveroo out of the UK, are <em>also</em> moving into grocery to better diversify.</p>
<p>In that regard, it&#8217;s very interesting to see Prosus in this round.</p>
<p>Prosus &#8212; which is, essentially, a tech giant that was separated out from the rest of Naspers some time ago as a separate, publicly-listed entity to better focus investment and attention on the space (it holds a huge stake in Tencent, among other things) &#8212; really got burned last year from its longstanding, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/prosus-makes-6-3b-hostile-bid-for-just-eat-which-rejects-deal-in-favor-of-takeaway-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hostile attempt</a> to acquire Just Eat, to combine it with Prosus&#8217; existing holdings in food delivery.</p>
<p>One of the bigger global takeout food delivery players, Just Eat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/justeat-takeaway-7-6b-merger-approved-pair-pick-up-756m-in-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instead eloped with Takeaway</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/just-eat-takeaway-confirms-its-gobbling-up-grubhub-in-a-7-3b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sailed off into the Grubhub sunset</a>, leaving Prosus bobbing in the water.</p>
<p>Since then, Prosus has been very proactive in using its capital to plot out its own course. That&#8217;s included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/indias-swiggy-raises-113m-led-by-prosus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stakes in Swiggy</a> in India, investing in that Kolonial round, and also today&#8217;s news backing Flink.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“The opportunity that exists for online grocery delivery is vast, with the grocery market in Germany alone expected to reach more than €300 billion in the coming years,&#8221; said Larry Illg, CEO of Food Delivery at Prosus, in a statement. &#8220;The past year has seen many new players entering the nascent market, vying to fulfill the increasing consumer demands. Flink comes to the market offering ultra-fast delivery of items, mostly under 10 minutes, getting consumers what they need almost immediately. Flink’s innovative tech-enabled logistics service combined with the expertise of the team, the quality of the partnerships they have quickly established and the pace of execution within Germany, has been nothing short of impressive.”</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&#8220;Flink is a pioneer in a new model of commerce that is purpose-built for consumers who expect better, faster, cheaper services,&#8221; added Daegwon Chae, general partner at BOND. &#8220;We have been impressed by Flink’s ability to scale rapidly while delighting customers through a seamless experience, and are excited to partner together as Flink builds the grocery store of the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flink is the rare combination of a great founding team tackling a huge market with a truly disruptive proposition. The grocery retail market in Germany is one of the largest undigitized markets at only 3% online penetration. We believe that the grocery store of the future will be hyper-local, instantly available, and always delighting its customers. With best-in-class operations and strong momentum, Flink can become a major player in the digital grocery sector, and we look forward to partnering with them on the journey,&#8221; said <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Amer Alaily at Mubadala Capital, in a statement.</span></p>
<p>More money for the space, and something tells me it&#8217;s not the final chapter. For us, we can order some popcorn on one (or more) of these platforms and watch how it plays out.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In its latest ambitious digital policy announcement, the European Union has proposed creating a framework for a &#8220;trusted and secure European e-ID&#8221; (aka digital identity) &#8212; which it said today it wants to be available to all citizens, residents and businesses to make it easer to use a national digital identity to prove who they [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its latest ambitious digital policy announcement, the European Union has proposed creating a framework for a &#8220;trusted and secure European e-ID&#8221; (aka digital identity) &#8212; which it <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2663">said today</a> it wants to be available to all citizens, residents and businesses to make it easer to use a national digital identity to prove who they are in order to access public sector or commercial services regardless of where they are in the bloc.</p>
<p>The EU does already have a regulation on electronic authentication systems (eIDAS), which entered into force in 2014, but the commission&#8217;s intention with the e-ID proposal is to expand on that by addressing some of its limitations and inadequacies (such as poor uptake and a lack of mobile support).</p>
<p>It also wants the e-ID framework to incorporate digital wallets &#8212; meaning the user will be able to choose to download a wallet app to a mobile device where they can store and selectively share electronic documents that might be needed for a specific identity verification transaction, such as when opening a bank account or applying for a loan. Other functions (like e-signing) are also envisaged being supported by these e-ID digital wallets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other examples the commission gives where it sees a harmonized e-ID coming in handy include renting a car or checking into a hotel. EU lawmakers also suggest full interoperability for authentication of national digital IDs could be helpful for citizens needing to submit a local tax declaration or enrolling in a regional university.</p>
<p>Some member states do already offer national electronic IDs but there&#8217;s a problem with interoperability across borders, per the commission, which noted today that just 14% of key public service providers across all member states allow cross-border authentication with an e-Identity system, though it also said cross-border authentications are rising.</p>
<p>A universally accepted &#8220;e-ID&#8221; could &#8212; in theory &#8212; help grease digital activity throughout the EU&#8217;s single market by making it easier for Europeans to verify their identity and access commercial or publicly provided services when travelling or living outside their home market.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers also seem to believe there&#8217;s an opportunity to &#8220;own&#8221; a strategic piece of the digital puzzle here, if they can create a unifying framework for all European national digital IDs &#8212; offering consumers not just a more convenient alternative to carrying around a physical version of their national ID (at least in some situations), and/or other documents they might need to show when applying to access specific services, but what commissioners billed today as a &#8220;European choice&#8221; &#8212; i.e., versus <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">commercial digital ID systems that may not offer the same high-level pledge of a &#8220;trusted and secure&#8221; ID system that lets the user entirely control who gets to sees which bits of their data.</span></p>
<p>A number of tech giants do of course already offer users the ability to sign in to third-party digital services using the same credentials to access their own service. But in most cases doing so means the user is opening a fresh conduit for their personal data to flow back to the data-mining platform giant that controls the credential, letting Facebook (etc.) further flesh out what it knows about that user&#8217;s internet activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new European Digital Identity Wallets will enable all Europeans to access services online without having to use private identification methods or unnecessarily sharing personal data. With this solution they will have full control of the data they share,&#8221; is the commission alternative vision for the proposed e-ID framework.</p>
<p>It also suggests the system could create substantial upside for European businesses &#8212; by supporting them in offering &#8220;a wide range of new services&#8221; atop the associated pledge of a &#8220;secure and trusted identification service.&#8221; And driving public trust in digital services is a key plank of how the commission approaches digital policymaking &#8212; arguing that it&#8217;s a essential lever to grow uptake of online services.</p>
<p>However to say this e-ID scheme is &#8220;ambitious&#8221; is a polite word for how viable it looks.</p>
<p>Aside from the tricky issue of adoption (i.e., actually getting Europeans to (A) know about e-ID, and (B) actually use it, by also (C) getting enough platforms to support it, as well as (D) getting providers on board to create the necessary wallets for envisaged functionality to pan out and be as robustly secure as promised), they&#8217;ll also &#8212; presumably &#8212; need to (E) convince and/or compel web browsers to integrate e-ID so it can be accessed in a streamlined way).</p>
<p>The alternative (not being baked into browsers&#8217; UIs) would surely make the other adoption steps trickier.</p>
<p>The commission&#8217;s press release is fairly thin on such detail, though &#8212; saying only that: &#8220;Very large platforms will be required to accept the use of European Digital Identity wallets upon request of the user.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a whole chunk of the proposal is given over to discussion of &#8220;Qualified certificates for website authentication&#8221; &#8212; a trusted services provision, also expanding on the approach taken in eIDAS, which the commission is keen for e-ID to incorporate in order to further boost user trust by offering a certified guarantee of who&#8217;s behind a website (although the proposal says it will be voluntary for websites to get certified).</p>
<p>The upshot of this component of the proposal is that web browsers would need to support and display these certificates, in order for the envisaged trust to flow &#8212; which sums to a whole lot of highly nuanced web infrastructure work needed to be done by third parties to interoperate with this EU requirement. (Work that browser makers already seem to have <a href="https://www.ccadb.org/documents/qualified_website_authentication_certificates_interoperability.pdf">expressed serious misgivings</a> about.)</p>
<p>&#8220;This regulation may force web browsers to accept additional types of &#8216;trust certificates,'&#8221; said security and privacy researcher, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Dr. Lukasz Olejnik</a>, discussing the commission&#8217;s proposal with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;This comes with a requirement for web browsers to honor such certificates and change the web browser user interfaces to display this in some way. It is doubtful that such a thing actually improves trust. If this was a mechanism to fight &#8216;fake news&#8217; it would be a cumbersome one. On the other hand we have an additional precedent here when web browser vendors are required to amend their security and privacy models.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Web browsers will be forced/compelled to accept authentication certificates. This is to guarantee the proof of the website operator identity.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Another big question mark thrown up by the commission&#8217;s e-ID plan is how exactly the envisaged certified digital identity wallets would store &#8212; and most importantly safeguard &#8212; user data. That very much remains to be determined, at this nascent stage.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s discussion in the regulation&#8217;s recitals, for example, of member states being <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">encouraged to &#8220;set up jointly sandboxes to test innovative solutions in a controlled and secure environment in particular to improve the functionality, protection of personal data, security and interoperability of the solutions and to inform future updates of technical references and legal requirements.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And it seems that </span>a range of approaches are being entertained, with recital 11 discussing using biometric authentication for accessing digital wallets (while also noting potential rights risks as well as the need to ensure adequate security):</p>
<blockquote><p>European Digital Identity Wallets should ensure the highest level of security for the personal data used for authentication irrespective of whether such data is stored locally or on cloud-based solutions, taking into account the different levels of risk. Using biometrics to authenticate is one of the identifications methods providing a high level of confidence, in particular when used in combination with other elements of authentication. Since biometrics represents a unique characteristic of a person, the use of biometrics requires organisational and security measures, commensurate to the risk that such processing may entail to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and in accordance with Regulation 2016/679.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s clear that underlying the commission&#8217;s big, huge idea of a unified (and unifying) European e-ID is a complex mass of requirements needed to deliver on the vision of a secure and trusted European digital ID that doesn&#8217;t just languish ignored and unused by most web users &#8212; some highly technical requirements, others (such as achieving the sought for widespread adoption) no less challenging.</p>
<p>The impediments to success here certainly look daunting.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, lawmakers are ploughing ahead, arguing that the pandemic&#8217;s acceleration of digital service adoption has shown the pressing need to address eIDAS&#8217; shortcomings &#8212; and deliver on the goal of &#8220;effective and user-friendly digital services across the EU.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside today&#8217;s regulatory proposal they&#8217;ve put out a recommendation, inviting member states to &#8220;establish a common toolbox by September 2022 and to start the necessary preparatory work immediately&#8221; &#8212; with a goal of publishing the agreed toolbox in October 2022 and starting pilot projects (based on the agreed technical framework) sometime thereafter.</p>
<p>&#8220;This toolbox should include the technical architecture, standards and guidelines for best practices,&#8221; the commission adds, eliding the large cans of worms being firmly cracked open.</p>
<p>Still, its penciled-in timeframe for mass adoption &#8212; of around a decade &#8212; does a better job of illustrating the scale of the challenge, with the commission writing that it wants 80% of citizens to be using an e-ID solution by 2030.</p>
<p>The even longer game the bloc is playing is to try to achieve digital sovereignty so it&#8217;s not beholden to foreign-owned tech giants. And an &#8220;own brand,&#8221; autonomously operated European digital identity does certainly align with that strategic goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trade schools are nothing new, but a new startup called <a href="https://mtcopeland.com/">Copeland</a> thinks it can build a big business by bringing education about plumbing, drywall, cabinetry and more to the masses through high-quality pre-filmed classes online that feature industry pros and professional educators.</p>
<p>If it sounds like a kind of MasterClass for all things construction, that&#8217;s not an accident. Copeland sprung from the mind of renowned investor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeldearing/">Michael Dearing</a>, who wrote the first check to MasterClass (now reportedly valued at <a href="https://www.axios.com/masterclass-new-funding-25-billion-valuation-f75521cd-3a85-4215-b4fa-c2ae48da9765.html">$2.5 billion</a>) and spied an opportunity in pairing underemployed Americans with homebuilders who can&#8217;t find enough people to hire. Meanwhile, Copeland&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Gabe Jewell, previously spent nearly four years as a creative producer with MasterClass.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to trade schools, Copeland, which charges for its content, is competing with an endless &#8212; and free &#8212; number of YouTube videos about how to both build and dismantle things. Still, the year-old, six-person, Bay Area-based company, which has produced <a href="https://mtcopeland.com/courses/">nine distinct pieces of content</a> so far, has investors excited about its prospects. Indeed, in addition to early backing from Dearing, the company just raised $5 million in seed funding from Defy.vc and Collaborative Fund in a round that brings its total funding to date to $7 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This afternoon, we talked with Jewell to learn more about what Copeland &#8212; <a href="https://mtcopeland.com/blog/faqs/where-did-the-name-m-t-copeland-come-from/">named after an educator</a> &#8212; is assembling, and whether homeowners, as well as aspiring tradespeople, are target customers, too. Some of that conversation follows, below:</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re trying to educate trade workers and those aspiring to work in construction &#8212; an industry that&#8217;s in the midst of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/finding-workers-is-getting-harder-for-busy-u-s-homebuilders">years-long labor shortage</a> and needs people with know-how. Do you envision awarding credentials so employers know your customers have gone through training?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: That&#8217;s on the table &#8212; proof of aptitude or certificates of completion after you&#8217;ve successfully passed an assessment. On the licensing side, that would be complicated because [general contractor] licenses are offered regionally, and you need to be a licensed electrical contractor so you don&#8217;t burn someone&#8217;s house down, and that&#8217;s a four-year process typically. So we&#8217;re right now focused more on general education and support rather than [anything more tangible than that].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Out of curiosity, how would you test users, given this is a one-to-many platform?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: Some of it could involve testing construction math &#8212; putting you through an assessment to ensure you know how to calculate angles and area and so forth. Other tests cold be more around general knowledge. We can&#8217;t, with an online test, ensure that you&#8217;ll build a great cabinet, but it&#8217;s easy to imagine [other testing] opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>TC: MasterClass relies on celebrities and stars in their respective fields. To generate more buzz, might you pull in celebrity homebuilders and tradespeople from do-it-yourself-type shows as teachers?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: We&#8217;re talking about that, too. There&#8217;s a healthy online community of professional builders who share what they do and they&#8217;ve given us a warm welcome. What&#8217;s most important to us is ensuring that the quality of instruction is really high.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I spent part of yesterday watching videos about how to dismantle a brick wall; it makes me wonder whether there will be content on your platform that&#8217;s accessible to, and even targeting, homeowners.</strong></p>
<p>GJ: We are hopefully going to see a DIY halo audience for this stuff. For example, deck building is an employable skill and one that we&#8217;ll teach you such that you can learn to do it as a professional would. At the same time, if you&#8217;re serious about building your own deck, who else would you rather learn it from than pros who know how to teach it?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also thinking of ways to bring those audiences together. You could learn how to dismantle that wall, but you could also come to Copeland to find a professional remodeler who you come to see as a trusted resource.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How long does it take to create each piece of programming for the site?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: It takes us a couple of months to put the courses together, which mostly fall right now between an hour and two hours, though we&#8217;ll see more variability in that down the road.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have partnerships with homebuilders or commercial real estate developers that are desperate right now for help?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: We are establishing partnerships with real estate builders. A few are [coming together now] and we&#8217;re really excited about growing that side of the business as we develop and film more stuff and add to our current library.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Will subscriptions be part of the picture as you build out that content?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: Yes, right now we charge $75 per course, and you have access to it forever, or a business can purchase a number or seats. As we grow the library, though, you&#8217;ll see see flexibility regarding the pricing structure.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What type of content is coming?</strong></p>
<p>GJ: Currently, we&#8217;re really focused on residential construction, both hands-on trade skills, like carpentry and cabinet making, but also blueprint reading, and we’ll continue to grow that by adding in plumbing, and drywall and general contractor skills, like reading contracts and risk management. But we&#8217;re also building a commercial construction management library that’s taught by university professors largely centered around skills between the field and the office. Maybe you’re an experienced craftsman and you need to learn leadership skills, or you come to construction from retail and you&#8217;re working in an office capacity and need to learn how to connect the dots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota AI Ventures, Toyota’s standalone venture capital fund, has dropped the &#8220;AI&#8221; and is reborn as, simply, Toyota Ventures. The fund is commemorating its new identity by investing an additional $300 million in emerging technologies and carbon neutrality via two early-stage funds: the Toyota Ventures Frontier Fund and the Toyota Ventures Climate Fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The introduction of these two new funds, each worth $150 million, brings Toyota Ventures&#8217; total assets under management to over $500 million. With the new capital infusion into the Frontier Fund comes an expansion of Toyota Ventures’ core thesis, which previously focused on AI, autonomy, mobility, robotics and the cloud, and now is adding smart cities, digital health, fintech and energy. So while Toyota Ventures’ investment approach isn’t changing, it’s broadening the scope of startups it will consider investing in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AI is kind of shrinking as a proportion of everything,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Adler, founding managing director of Toyota Ventures,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TechCrunch. “The first mission of the Frontier Fund has always been to discover what’s next for Toyota. Toyota pivoted to cars in the 1930s, and Toyota will grow to other businesses in the future. Startups are experiments in the marketplace, and this is a way for us to understand and get comfortable with where innovations are coming from.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota as a global company has more than 370,000 employees that cover a range of business units in which the company at large stands to benefit from investing, such as financial technology. The Frontier Fund is a step outside of mobility. It not only seeks to bring emerging tech to market, but it also wants to bring new innovations onboard, whether as a customer or an acquisition, according to Adler. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the vision of the company really is that machines are here to stay, they amplify the human experience, and Toyota understands how machines amplify humans really well for the benefit of society, which sounds incredibly corny, but the company really believes that,” said Adler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By that same token, the new Climate Fund seeks to invest in startups that can help Toyota accelerate its goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. The company has been investing in hydrogen for years, including a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/toyota-partners-with-eneos-to-explore-a-hydrogen-powered-woven-city/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent partnership with Japanese fuel company ENEOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s open to whatever technology will help achieve carbon neutrality, according to Adler.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think renewable energies will play a role,” said Adler. “Hydrogen production, storage distribution and utilization will play a role. We think carbon capture and storage will play a role. We’re not going to get dogmatic about hydrogen because we’ve been at it for decades and maybe things will change. Hydrogen hasn’t been crowdsourced across the startup community because there just wasn’t a market for it, but I think the market may be emerging.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund is accepting online pitches on its </span><a href="https://toyota.ventures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from entrepreneurs seeking early-stage funding. On Thursday, Toyota Ventures also announced it would be expanding its team and working with a new Advisor Network as a resource for founders looking for guidance on anything from product development to diversity and recruitment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Toyota Ventures has been an invaluable partner for Boxbot since they invested in our seed round in 2018,” said Austin Oehlerking, co-founder and CEO of Boxbot, in a statement. “They have been instrumental in helping us to navigate complicated, existential challenges on our journey from concept to product/market fit. Jim and the team really understand how corporate venture capital should function in order to successfully partner with startups.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adler says he and his team come from an entrepreneurial background, so they understand what it’s like on the other side of the table. Toyota Ventures’ focuses on early-stage startups because that’s where it believes some of the most interesting innovations come from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a big believer that early-stage venture capital is a telescope into the future,” said Adler. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we can actually find those incredibly valuable innovations that make this all worthwhile.”</span></p>
