										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The unprecedented rush of venture capital into startups is having an interesting knock-on effect:</p>
<p>&#8220;Venture capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/vcs-are-racing-to-pay-more-to-get-smaller-pieces-of-less-profitable-companies/">investors are racing to pay more to buy smaller pieces of startups</a> that are less profitable than before,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm, who studied Silicon Valley Bank&#8217;s State of the Markets Report Q4 2021.</p>

<hr />
<p>Going for larger rounds with higher multiples means reduced ownership, and it&#8217;s shifting more power to founders as investors are &#8220;paying more and at shorter intervals for less of less profitable startups.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have never used this space to offer advice, but if you believe you have a good idea for a startup — go for it. When venture capitalists say this is a good time to be a founder, you know they <em>absolutely</em> mean it.</p>

<p>The pandemic has rewritten the way investors and startup founders do business, but “chemistry is important,” notes Brian Heater.</p>
<p>Laela Sturdy, general partner at CapitalG, and Webflow co-founder and CEO Vlad Magdalin joined Brian on TechCrunch Live to discuss COVID-era deal-making and the changing nature of startup-investor relationships.</p>
<p>“As great as Zoom is, to me, that in-person experience takes you to the next level of getting to know someone,” said Sturdy.</p>

<p>Deep tech holds a lot of potential for changing how our world functions, but many applications are still years away from reaching the market.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Anna Heim analyzed pi Ventures’ Deep Tech Shifts 2026 report, which explores 15 deep tech subsectors expected to reach an inflection point in the next five years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;If you invest too early in an innovation, then you will have suboptimal returns,” said founding partner Manish Singhal. “If you invest too late, you may also end up getting suboptimal returns, because it is no longer a cutting-edge thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If investment and the timing of innovation getting to a resonance point come together, then good things happen.”</p>

<h2>Why QED, hot on Nubank, is bullish about LatAm fintech</h2>

<p>Brazil-based Nubank&#8217;s IPO is generating a lot of interest, so Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm interviewed Lauren Morton, a partner at QED.</p>
<p>Her firm invested in Nubank&#8217;s Series A, B, D and E, but &#8220;since then, the fintech-focused fund has made more investments in the region,&#8221; they report.</p>
<p>In an extended Q&amp;A, Morton shared why QED is bullish on LatAm fintech and offered a few predictions:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the volume and pace we have seen so far this year will continue into 2022, but we’re also realistic enough to know that valuations can’t keep rising indefinitely. There will be a correction at some point, but make no mistake that some big, real businesses will emerge over the next few years regardless of whether money into the region slows down or not.</p></blockquote>

<p>SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 1 is still the world&#8217;s largest tech investment fund, but founder Masayoshi Son committed to an $8.8 billion buyback after it reported its latest quarterly results.</p>
<p>One aggravating factor: Chinese regulators made ride-hailing app Didi, one of the fund&#8217;s chief investments, stop accepting new customers and pull its app, resulting in the company&#8217;s shares plummeting.</p>
<p>The Japanese fund&#8217;s investment in Didi has now lost nearly $5 billion in value since its initial investment, Alex Wilhelm writes.</p>

<p>Training an AI to do something is difficult, and deploying AI solutions across an entire enterprise is an undertaking most companies struggle with.</p>
<p>Because the field is still taking shape, there&#8217;s no single framework for managing such a project, and organizations need best practices like fish need water.</p>
<p>Roey Mechrez, co-founder and CTO of BeyondMinds, outlines the main barriers to enterprise-wide AI adoption, offering detailed suggestions for addressing &#8220;the orchestration problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Mechrez, &#8220;enterprises should take a step back and see the big picture of the AI journey, and start thinking of a systematic way to utilize many AI models in a single, robust framework.&#8221;</p>

<p>The work lives of the users of CentOS 8, the popular free-to-use clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, were upended when Red Hat announced that it would cease supporting release 8 after December 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can’t really blame a profit-centered organization for focusing on its objectives, but a shift in objectives can have significant implications for some users,&#8221; says Joao Correia, a technical evangelist at CloudLinux.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet found an alternative, he shares a few open source options companies can use to reduce risks and comply with enterprise security policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;With just a month to go, time is running out.&#8221;</p>

<p>HashiCorp&#8217;s IPO filing last week gave us a good look at why the software company has managed to grow to where it is now: a strong subscription model driving &#8220;mostly recurring, high-margin revenues that have proven sticky over time,&#8221; Alex Wilhelm writes.</p>
<p>The company reportedly expects to be valued at about $10 billion, but with slowing growth, its per-share IPO pricing and resulting valuation may depend on whether the investors who are along for the ride get queasy during deceleration.</p>

<p>Founders of companies that are eligible for Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) can pay zero federal capital gains tax when they cash out — if they hold those shares for five years.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, not everyone can time when to sell their company,&#8221; write Calvin Lo and Peyton Carr of Keystone Global Partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that many acquisitions happen before five years leaves some founders and investors short of qualifying for these powerful tax savings,&#8221; but a Section 1045 rollover &#8220;can salvage the opportunity in some cases.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has released the second developer beta of iOS 15.2, which includes support for its new communication safety feature in Messages. The feature was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/new-apple-technology-will-warn-parents-and-children-about-sexually-explicit-photos-in-messages/">announced earlier this year</a>, alongside the company&#8217;s controversial new child sexual abuse (CSAM) detection technology feature, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">Apple delayed</a> following backlash.</p>
<p>The new Messages feature, meanwhile, is meant to allow parents to play a more active and informed role when it comes to helping their children learn to navigate online communication. Messages will be able to use on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments and determine if a photo being shared is sexually explicit. This technology does not require Apple to access or read the child’s private communications, as all the processing happens on the device. It&#8217;s a Family Sharing feature for parents to opt in.</p>
<p>If a sensitive photo is discovered in a message thread, the image will be blocked and a label will appear below the photo that states, “this may be sensitive” with a link to click to view the photo. If the child chooses to view the photo, another screen appears with more information. Here, a message informs the child that sensitive photos and videos “show the private body parts that you cover with bathing suits” and “it’s not your fault, but sensitive photos and videos can be used to harm you.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231521" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Apple has made some changes to the communications safety feature compared to its initial plans. The company had originally planned to notify parents if their child under the age of 13 viewed an explicit image in Messages. Apple has since removed this feature after receiving criticism that it could pose risks for the children in question.</p>
<p>The communications safety feature is currently available in the beta version of iOS 15.2. It’s currently unknown when Apple plans to officially release the feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Health tech startup Color has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/color-announces-series-e-financing-at-a-valuation-of-4-6-billion-to-accelerate-expansion-of-accessible-and-equitable-public-health-infrastructure-301419932.html">raised $100 million</a> in Series E funding, bringing the company’s valuation to $4.6 billion. This round means Color has now raised a total of $378 million, with this latest round specifically meant to help the company offer new programs that deliver the last mile of care across healthcare services.</p>
<p>The round was led by Kindred Ventures and by funds managed by T. Rowe Price, along with participation from existing investors including General Catalyst, Viking Global Investors, and Emerson Collective. In January, Color <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/color-raises-167-million-funding-at-1-5-billion-valuation-to-expand-last-mile-of-u-s-health-infrastructure/">raised $167 million</a> in Series D funding, at a valuation of $1.5 billion. This latest round triples that measure of the company&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>Color’s software and infrastructure provide tools for preventative health and infectious disease management by making healthcare programs more accessible. To date, Color has partnered with almost 1,000 organizations, including public health departments, employers, and universities to help people get faster access to healthcare services. Its partners include Salesforce, the National Institutes of Health, the State of California, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and more. The company currently facilitates over 6,500 COVID-19 testing sites at offices and schools, and it also runs 500 vaccination sites across the country.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231381" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we have built will serve as a critical piece of public health infrastructure to deliver access to healthcare services to those who need them most,&#8221; said Color CEO Othman Laraki. &#8220;We have learned that there is an exponential uptick in people&#8217;s ability to use these services as they become simpler and more convenient. Public health should happen where public life happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, Color’s approach is to rethink healthcare delivery in order to make it accessible directly in people’s lives with low transaction costs in a way that’s scalable and doesn&#8217;t require a lot of clinical resourcing.</p>
<p>With this latest round of funding, Color aims to accelerate the expansion of accessible public health infrastructure by helping people get access to screening, diagnostics, and initial treatments for their health needs. Color’s offerings will now include vaccination and preventative health services for schools and employers. It also plans to offer infectious disease management programs in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Color has built a strong, sustainable, and profitable business that can scale alongside the myriad of health challenges the U.S. faces,&#8221; said Color CFO <span class="xn-person">Mike Herring</span>. &#8220;The response from our partners has been incredibly positive, and our remarkable team has delivered at scale with both pace and quality of execution.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Laraki co-founded Color in 2013 based on his own experience. The company tells TechCrunch his grandmother passed away from breast cancer and that his mother is a breast cancer survivor. He himself is a carrier of a BRCA2 mutation, which can increase an individual&#8217;s risk for cancer. Finding out this unique risk was challenging for him and he believed that the entire experience felt like something that could have become a much simpler healthcare transaction. Laraki&#8217;s experience was the catalyst to building Color, which now aims to make healthcare programs more accessible and cost-effective.</p>
<p>The company says its combination of existing offerings and new services expands its efforts to build public health technology and infrastructure for governments, employers, and other institutions that care for large populations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Distributed work is becoming the norm for many tech companies as the pandemic waxes and wanes. But there are plenty of ways to mess it up, especially if you’re attempting a hybrid solution — or if you’re secretly pining for the office.</p>
<p>I recently sat down with two experts on the topic to learn more: Wendy Nice Barnes, chief people officer at Gitlab, and Phil Libin, founder and CEO of startup studio All Turtles and mmhmm.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Our philosophy is we&#8217;re not remote, we&#8217;re distributed intentionally in the same way that the internet is a distributed system.							<cite>Phil Libin</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Barnes joined the long-time distributed WebOps company during the pandemic, after a career working in physical tech offices as a human resources leader.</p>
<p>Libin, after a long Silicon Valley career built around office meetings, has gone through the process of learning to love distributed over the last couple of years. As part of the process, he founded mmhmm, a video conference company (that&#8217;s fully distributed).</p>
<p>I’ve highlighted a few points from the conversation, below, including getting the mentality right, how to handle vacations and a couple tips on fundraising.</p>
<h2>Think &#8220;distributed&#8221;</h2>
<p>&#8220;Of course, some of it is harder. There are obvious disadvantages,&#8221; Libin said, regarding going distributed. &#8220;How about we focus on the amazing superpower advantages, like the fact that 0% of the people in our companies waste any time commuting? Not like the fact that they can live anywhere they want, like the fact that they can be fully productive. There are like massive advantages. Focus on those, and everything becomes much better.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is experimenting with games, initially in partnership with mobile gaming giant Zynga. On Monday, Zynga <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211108005289/en/Zynga-Announces-Disco-Loco-3D-Exclusively-for-TikTok">announced</a> its plans to launch a new HTML5-based game, &#8220;Disco Loco 3D,&#8221; exclusively on the TikTok platform. The casual game is a single-player endless runner where players collect their own dance moves while challenging friends, avoiding obstacles, and collecting medallions as they walk down a catwalk, similar in spirit to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/rollic-zynga-uncosoft/">Zynga&#8217;s</a> &#8220;High Heels.&#8221; While TikTok says the game is meant to test its audience&#8217;s general interest in gaming within its app, the company confirmed that discussions with other game makers are already underway.</p>
<p>HTML5-based mobile gaming has become a popular way to reach a large number of global users, particularly those in emerging markets where consumers may not own high-end phones or be able to afford fast data plans. Google, for example, embraced the format with its launch of the HTML5 gaming platform GameSnacks, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/area-120-is-beginning-to-use-googles-massive-reach-to-scale-html5-gamesnacks-platform/"> this year scaled</a> across Google Chrome&#8217;s new tab page in markets like India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Kenya.</p>
<p>More broadly, however, the tech industry is making the connection between platforms where users go to be entertained or to socialize, and platforms dedicated to gaming. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/area-120-is-beginning-to-use-googles-massive-reach-to-scale-html5-gamesnacks-platform/">stepped into cloud gaming</a> last year with its launch of Facebook Gaming on the web and Android. And Netflix has just launched its own gaming service to its global users on Android, and today, iOS, saying that the company believes gaming is just another category of entertainment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231321" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now, it seems TikTok is open to exploring that concept, as well.</p>
<p>TikTok tells TechCrunch the partnership with Zynga will help the company to better understand how its community engages with games. The company today has a captive audience of gaming fans, including both casual and hardcore gamers, it said, but it doesn&#8217;t know if these users would respond to a gaming integration like this.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t TikTok&#8217;s first-ever game, however. The company earlier this year launched its own game &#8220;Garden of Good,&#8221; which was built <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/partners/current-promotions/tiktok">in partnership with nonprofit Feeding America</a> and was focused on charitable fundraising. While that game may have given TikTok some early data on user interest in gaming, the game itself was a different type of experience. In the game, TikTok users would care for their own garden and support friends who were playing the game. And when the garden grew, they could have TikTok make a donation to Feed America using their points.</p>
<p>Zynga&#8217;s integration is a more traditional game, although it&#8217;s not currently monetized, TikTok notes. There are no in-app purchases or revenue share on the game&#8217;s earnings, for example. Instead, the focus, for the time being, is on testing TikTok users&#8217; gaming appetite.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As for Zynga, the company said it sees TikTok as a platform that will allow it to reach new audiences through the app&#8217;s massive reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zynga has a rich history of creating games that utilize platforms’ unique user experiences to bring fresh and fun concepts that resonate with players wherever and whenever they get their entertainment,&#8221; said Bernard Kim, President of Publishing at Zynga, in a statement.</p>
<p>The game is not currently live on TikTok but will roll out in the coming weeks on both iOS and Android across North American markets.</p>
<p>The partnership with Zynga may be the first to come of TikTok&#8217;s broader investigation into mobile gaming. The company told TechCrunch it&#8217;s in discussions with other gaming partners for similar deals, but can&#8217;t announce details at this time.</p>
<p>The gaming news was announced alongside Zynga&#8217;s Q3 earnings, where<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/08/zyngas-q3-2021-bookings-of-668-are-up-6-from-a-year-ago/"> the company reported revenue</a> of $705 million, up 40% year-over-year, and bookings fo $668 million, up 6% year-over-year. Zynga also said it hired a former Coca-Cola exec, Matthew Wolf, to lead its blockchain gaming business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://originventures.com/">Origin Ventures</a>, the 22-year-old, early-stage, Chicago-based venture firm, just closed its fifth fund with $130 million in capital commitments, which makes the vehicle the firm&#8217;s biggest.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t necessarily aiming to break any records, suggests managing partner Jason Heltzer, who says the firm was initially looking to raise $100 million. Still, institutional demand for a bigger piece of the private-company action is driving a lot of firms to raise ever bigger funds, and Origin wasn&#8217;t immune to the interest, which grew after some recent exits, including the sale of the restaurant reservation platform Tock earlier this year for <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/fwpro/squarespace-acquired-tock-platform">$400 million</a>.</p>
<p>We emailed last night with Heltzer to learn a bit more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231348" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What was your pitch to LPs in raising this fund?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We really emphasized our thesis, telling investors we were going to continue to focus on the digital native economy and invest in software and marketplace businesses &#8211; both B2B and consumer &#8211; solving the unique needs of millennials and Gen Z. Those generations have had three things from a very early age: the internet, a smart phone, and social media [and] the way they live, work, and play is just different than previous generations, and that breeds opportunity for startups.</p>
<p>Then as these generations inevitably age, they accumulate more consumer buying power and more authority in companies, naturally fueling the growth of our investments. Those generations are now more than 50% of our workforce and already command more purchasing power than other generations.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This fund is quite a bit larger than your fourth fund, which closed with $80 million. Any changes to the team?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>JH: Since our last fund, we&#8217;ve added a managing partner, Alex Meyer, and promoted Scott Stern and Prashant Shukla to partner. We also added two senior associates: Jacquie Marshall Siegmund and Angela Smith. Prashant has relocated from Chicago to Silicon Valley and Scott is relocating from Chicago to the DC Metro area, so we&#8217;ll now have partners in all four time zones in the continental U.S., putting our team no more than a 90-minute flight from an elite team working on a disruptive idea.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What size checks will you be writing, and in terms of ownership, how much of a company do you expect in exchange for your checks?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We’ll write checks from $500,000 up to $6 million to lead seed and Series A financings. The larger fund will allow us to lead larger Series A rounds. And we target meaningful ownership with every first check, which translates to 7% to 12% in each deal in this market.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you still think that Chicago is overlooked by coastal VCs? That&#8217;s been a problem historically.</strong></p>
<p>JH:  No. There are too many successes in Chicago to ignore (Grubhub, Cleversafe, G2, Livongo, Cameo, Tovala, Tock, Groupon, ShipBob, and the list goes on). And most top firms have made at least one investment in the Windy City, if not many. That was before COVID, and now there are fewer barriers.</p>
<p>Chicago also remains the best city for venture returns because the lower cost of doing business, lower valuations, and great outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are you funding now that maybe wasn&#8217;t a theme or an industry &#8212; or not a major one &#8212; three to five years ago?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We’ve been active in the ‘workplace of the future’ for many years, but emerging themes include the creator economy, Web3, and communities.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are valuations in Chicago as crazy as elsewhere?</strong></p>
<p>JH: Valuations are historically high just about everywhere, although in the Bay Area it’s magnified. The gap has narrowed in recent years, but it will remain for several reasons. Most of our investing is in other markets; we’ve invested in 18 other metropolitan areas outside of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you price sensitive? When is a deal too rich for you?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We aim to pay a fair price that is calibrated by the market. The firm has been investing in venture since 1999, and we’ve been through many up and down cycles (yes, there are down cycles in venture). Exits like Grubhub, <a href="https://press.backlotcars.com/news/#:~:text=KAR%20Auction%20Services%2C%20Inc.%2C,in%20North%20America%20and%20Europe">BacklotCars</a>, and <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2021/3/31/22360963/tock-reservations-sold-squarespace-website-kokonas-alinea-hospitality-restaurants">Tock</a> have also taught us that being in a winner when you have conviction is way more important than typical valuation fluctuations in those early rounds.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How many deals is Origin doing each year?</strong></p>
<p>JH: We expect to invest in 22 to24 companies out of this fund, over a three-year timeframe. To date, we’ve made 14 investments, so we&#8217;re averaging about 8 new investments a year.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Which of your portfolio companies has raised the most money from you?</strong></p>
<p>JH: Our portfolio companies have raised over $450 million  from growth investors in the last 18 months, including Cameo’s $100 million Series C (total raised: $165 million), Fountain’s Series C (total raised: $119 million),and Tovala’s $30 million Series C (total raised: $69 million). These are also our largest active bets as a firm measured by our capital invested.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You can&#8217;t raise more than $370 million on a good idea alone. But you can raise a seed round worth a few million from Aileen Lee with that and a few other critical ingredients.</p>
<p>Guild Education CEO Rachel Carlson did just that. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aileen-lee/">Aileen Lee, founder and managing partner of Cowboy Ventures,</a> led a $2 million seed round in 2015 before <a href="https://www.guildeducation.com/">Guild Education</a> even had a real product.</p>
<p>Carlson and her co-founder, Brittany Stich, had been running educational classes on their own while in school at Stanford and saw a massive, scalable opportunity.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If the market size is big enough, it&#8217;s really important to put it at the beginning of the deck.							<cite>Aileen Lee</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with Guild Education, it&#8217;s an education and upskilling platform that started by focusing on the 99%. Carlson and Stich realized that the vast majority of upskilling platforms focused on the top third of the labor triangle in the U.S., such as helping a developer get a better developer job or helping an executive be a better executive.</p>
<h2>Starting out in a strip mall</h2>
<p>Stich and Carlson rented out space in a strip mall and developed a boot camp model with classes focused on how to find a job or how to better communicate your experience on your resume.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was nervous to be a non-product founder and I was not particularly technical,&#8221; said Carlson. &#8220;In hindsight, it&#8217;s so fun to look back through our deck because we had an idea about the problem to be solved and a lot of ideas about distribution. We were pretty unsure about what the product was going to be, but we were sure we would find our way to the right product if we stayed obsessive about the problem.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are dozens of devices out there that are eager to beat your muscles to within an inch of their tense little lives. They all have one thing in common: They&#8217;re a lot more powerful and have more endurance than the nimble fingers of a massage therapist. A trained and skilled therapist still has the upper hand when it comes to meeting your kneads, however, which is the ability to touch you and figuring out what state your muscles are in.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.thepact.com/">Pact from Impact Biosystems</a>, which today opened for preorders. The Pact system has all the muscle-mashing skills of its many competitors, but if it were yet another Theragun knock-off, you probably wouldn&#8217;t be reading about it here. Instead, the company took a broader look at why hands-on massage therapy is, generally, more satisfying than sacrificing your lot to a jackhammer. The result is the Pact Scan, a second device that seeks to emulate the tender love and care of a therapist by using technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We created a system that is actually measuring your muscles and then reacting in different ways, in real time. Pact Scan is a device that you hold up to your muscles. In under five seconds, it takes a series of scans which then quantifies your muscles. Every level of stiffness has a natural frequency damping ratio. We take those parameters &#8212; we call it &#8216;muscle readiness&#8217; &#8212; which is essentially giving your muscle a score. Are your muscles ready for exertion? Are they warmed up enough?&#8221; explains Bridget Hunter-Jones, the co-founder and CEO of Impact Biosystems.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230893" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Existing muscle recovery solutions are almost exclusively one-size-fits-all types of products,” said Hunter-Jones. &#8220;But, everyone and their recovery is different, so we designed the Pact system with the belief that recovery should be informed and personalized, using data from the body, effectively eliminating the guesswork.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s products are more expensive than its premium competitors &#8212; <a href="https://www.therabody.com/us/en-us/percussive-devices-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therabody&#8217;s Theragun starts at $399 for its most-comparable Elite model</a> &#8212; but Impact Biosystems hopes that its data-forward approach will lure in its customers. The company claims that there are no competitors for its offering anywhere, and that the closest comparable products are medical devices costing 10 times more than its product &#8212; and are primarily used for academic and research purposes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230930" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230930" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230930" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg 5184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bridget-Hunter-Jones-CEO.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230930" class="wp-caption-text">Bridget Hunter-Jones is the co-founder and CEO of Impact Biosystems. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Impact Biosystems</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;This will be the first device that will be collecting this data in this particular way. The competing medical devices cost more than $6,000, and they are not using the same kinds of core technologies and algorithms that we use,&#8221; explains Hunter-Jones, &#8220;These devices are used for sarcopenia patients, and to track muscle mass in other contexts. We are emulating how a therapist works. They have the experience from being able to compare your muscles to the muscles of the hundreds of people they have touched in the past, and use this to inform how to treat a particular muscle.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Contrary to what you might expect, the Pact Scan device is not using an electric measurement. Instead, it gently uses a little built-in mallet to tap your muscles, and it measures the response of your muscles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to get it into the hands of folks who are intimidated of the other brands out there. We&#8217;ve spent a lot of time on the brand, making sure it is approachable, comfortable and not hyper-masculine,&#8221; says Hunter-Jones, &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited to start targeting this to casual, occasional athletes, Pilates-goers, yoga instructors, etc. People who don&#8217;t need to be hammering their muscles blindly.&#8221;</p>
<p>For its launch, the company is making two kits available; the Pact Sport Kit at $499, and a Pact Pro Kit, which weighs in at $649, and includes an additional battery handle and a travel case. The company is planning to start shipping its products in May 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/netflix-games-are-coming-to-all-members-on-android-starting-this-week/">launched its debut lineup of mobile games</a> to Android users globally. Today, the games are expanding to users on iOS. The lineup, which includes two &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games and a few other casual gaming titles, will be delivered to iOS users the same way they are on Android. That is, they&#8217;re not streamed from the cloud, but actually installed to users&#8217; phones or tablets directly from the App Store.</p>
<p>With the Android launch, Netflix introduced a new &#8220;Games&#8221; tab within the app where users could browse the catalog and find a game they wanted to play. But to actually play the game, they would be directed to the Google Play Store to install the game on their device. Upon first launch, users would then sign into the game with their Netflix credentials.</p>
<p>Netflix says it&#8217;s using a similar system with the launch of Netflix games on iPhone and iPad. Except now, users are directed to Apple&#8217;s App Store for the downloads, not Google Play. The games will also require users to authenticate with their Netflix membership information in order to begin playing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231338" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company believes this system is compliant with Apple&#8217;s App Store rules, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/apple-revises-app-store-rules-to-permit-game-streaming-apps-clarify-in-app-purchases-and-more/">which were modified last year</a> to be more permissive around gaming apps.</p>
<p>Though updated in response to address the growing number of cloud gaming services, Apple&#8217;s policy indicates that developers are allowed to offer a centralized app that offers its subscribers access to a gaming catalog, so long as each title within that catalog has its own, dedicated App Store listing. Apple said this would allow it to review each gaming title separately. The system had actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/gameclub-offers-mobile-gamings-greatest-hits-for-5-per-month/">been pioneered by the subscription-based</a> gaming service GameClub, as a way to offer a broader selection of classic gaming titles that were only playable by its members.</p>
<p>However, there is one difference between the iOS implementation of Netflix games and how the system works on Android.</p>
<p>Netflix users on Android have their own dedicated &#8220;Games&#8221; tab in the app&#8217;s navigation, but iOS users will not. Instead, iPhone members will only see a dedicated games row in the app where they can select any game to download. Meanwhile, iPad members will see the row (pinned to position 6) and will be able to access games from the categories drop-down menu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The comapny told TechCrunch that while Apple has been a great partner on Netflix games, it wasn&#8217;t entirely clear to Netflix if a gaming tab would bump up against another App Store policy, which bans apps that offer their own &#8220;app stores.&#8221; Since Netflix believes the tab is not critical to being able to offer the gaming experience to iOS users, it made the decision to launch without it. However, if the company is able to get more clarity around this rule in the future, it may be able to add a Games tab to its iOS app like the one available now on Android.</p>
<p>At launch, the gaming lineup remains the same as it does on Android. This includes two titles from BonusXP, &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; and &#8220;Stranger Things 3: The Game;&#8221; as well as two titles from Frosty Pop, &#8220;Teeter&#8221; and &#8220;Shooting Hoops;&#8221; and one title from Rogue Games, &#8220;Card Blast.&#8221; The first two games are spinoffs from the popular Netflix show, &#8220;Stranger Things,&#8221; but the latter three are just casual titles.</p>
<p>Longer-term, Netflix has plans to expand this catalog with other additions and gaming genres. For example, the company in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">acquired</a> the independent game developer Night School Studio, best known for narrative-driven titles like &#8220;Oxenfree,&#8221; to further build out its library of Netflix games.</p>
<p>Netflix explained its interest in gaming as just another way to entertain and retain subscribers &#8212; not a way to generate direct revenues from the games themselves. At present, the games are free to download, free from ads, and don&#8217;t include any in-app purchases. The company has said that as its catalog grows, it could apply its same recommendation algorithms to suggest new games to mobile users, instead of just TV shows and movies.</p>
<p>“We view gaming as another content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation, and unscripted TV,” <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Netflix’s Q2 2021 shareholder letter</a> stated, adding that the company&#8217;s initial focus would be on free games designed for mobile devices. &#8220;Since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games,” Netflix said.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Two weeks ago, 50 iconic founders and investors shared their insights on how the world can tackle the planetary &#8220;Code Red&#8221; with over 2,000 participants at the inaugural <a href="https://sosvclimatetech.com">SOSV Climate Tech Summit</a>.</p>
<p>Here are key takeaways from over 16 hours of programming.</p>
<h2>It’s not clean tech 2.0</h2>
<p>Is it another clean tech bubble? While the previous boom and bust arguably led to several successful companies (we might include Tesla), it’s different this time. The difference is that people and governments are pushing corporations and funds toward net-zero, and this movement is not going away.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tony Fadell, father of the iPod and the iPhone, the co-founder of Nest, and now an investor with <a href="http://futureshapellc.com">Future Shape</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsoaHur7E9w">said during the Summit</a>: &#8220;​​Every company has some problem with clean to solve. [ … ] It’s a new industrial revolution, and pretty exciting, frankly.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The opportunity of a lifetime</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/bill-gates-expects-8-to-10-teslas-and-a-google-amazon-and-microsoft.html">As Bill Gates put it during his interview</a> with climate tech journalist Amy Harder, &#8220;There will be 10 Teslas out of this space, and only one of them is well known today.&#8221;</p>
<p>This echoed the statement that &#8220;500 to 1,000 unicorns created by such a complete reconstruction of industries,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech/">as Sean O’Sullivan</a>, managing partner of <a href="http://www.sosv.com">SOSV</a>, said at TechCrunch Disrupt in September, and the recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-next-1000-unicorns-will-be-in-climate-tech.html">prediction by Larry Fink</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/">Blackrock</a> that &#8220;the next 1,000 unicorns will be in climate tech&#8221; at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUh1ZvESbEc">&#8220;Valleys of Death&#8221; panel</a>, Arvind Gupta, partner at <a href="http://mayfield.com">Mayfield</a>, who recently published a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/a-roadmap-for-climate-investors/">roadmap for climate investors</a>, explained that &#8220;re-materializing our economy&#8221; was a $100 trillion opportunity. Suzanne Fletcher, general partner at <a href="http://primemoverslab.com">Prime Movers Lab</a>, added that we were in the golden age for breakthrough science, and while &#8220;it’s the second inning for EVs, it is the first for agtech and other sectors, with a lot still untouched and undercapitalized.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dr. Clea Kolster, chief science officer of <a href="http://lowercarboncapital.com">Lowercarbon Capital</a>, said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFBrml7y4VM">carbon-removal panel</a>, that &#8220;Whether we achieve net-zero or not, we need to roll back the CO2 that we’ve emitted. Carbon removal needs to become the size of the oil and gas industry, a trillion-dollar market. Today it’s about a billion dollars.&#8221;</p>
<h2>It’s about people</h2>
<p>Last year, clean tech veteran investor Vinod Khosla wrote that we needed <a href="https://www.khoslaventures.com/a-few-critical-climate-technology-breakthroughs-multiplied-by-instigators-is-desperately-needed">breakthroughs supported by a dozen instigators</a> — we could call them the &#8220;green dozen.&#8221; At the summit, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYgfSAuuAg">he reiterated this view</a>, highlighting that we need more tech talent and Ph.D.s to pursue those breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Josh Santos, CEO of <a href="http://noya.co">Noya</a>, a startup that retrofits industrial cooling towers to capture CO2, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFBrml7y4VM&amp;t=41s">felt optimistic</a>, saying, “More than ever, there is a surge of interest of people that previously had jobs outside of climate that are looking at moving into climate. We need the federal mandates, but none of it matters if we don’t have people to do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayfield’s Gupta added that his chief worry was about scientists that have brilliant ideas but not the means to follow up. Katie Rae, CEO and managing partner of MIT’s <a href="https://www.engine.xyz">The Engine</a>, added that we must ensure scientists believe they could be entrepreneurs, and investors need to back people who don’t look like the people who have won before. In the same spirit, Alex Greenhalgh, CEO of bio-silk company <a href="https://www.spintex.co.uk">Spintex</a>, encouraged scientists to venture out, saying, &#8220;You can’t see someone wearing your academic paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>To summarize the scale of efforts needed, Bill Gross, the founder of <a href="https://www.idealab.com">Idealab</a>, <a href="https://heliogen.com">Heliogen</a> and <a href="https://www.energyvault.com">Energy Vault</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsBVm1t0NPQ">said</a>, &#8220;We need thousands of shots on goal to do it, and entrepreneurship is the answer.&#8221;</p>
<h2>It needs patient capital</h2>
<p>Climate tech is not a walk in the park and the playbook is yet to be written. Khosla <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYgfSAuuAg">said</a> that a good analogy was biotech/pharma investing, where it takes 10-15 years from concept to a drug approved on market. &#8220;Climate tech is the same way,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>David Tze, CEO of <a href="https://www.novonutrients.com">Novonutrients</a>, which uses industrial CO2 to produce proteins, detailed the steps and &#8220;valleys of death&#8221; that startups need to cross: &#8220;You need to find investors who are willing to support a multistage, scale-up process as you go from a laboratory benchtop to the floor scale, to field pilot, to demo scale, to small, large and very large commercial scale … and that takes years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott Jacobs, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://generatecapital.com">Generate</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWkOkmPpt9Y">added</a>, &#8220;It is a real mistake to think that capital is just fuel. Your investors will be involved for a long time and hopefully can provide much more than fuel.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Money wants green</h2>
<p>The climate tech funding stack is still lacking in parts, but things are trending upward, with a new climate tech fund or SPAC seemingly announced every week. In addition, institutional investors are looking for new assets to re-allocate and &#8220;green&#8221; their portfolio.</p>
<p>As Mateo Jaramillo, a former Tesla VP and now CEO of <a href="https://formenergy.com">Form Energy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7oSRkPVr54">explained</a>, &#8220;[Energy storage can be a] new asset class to invest in, like coal or natural gas.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Watch for frontrunners</h2>
<p>Things are already in motion. Matt Peterson, director of the Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbhryfNeAkA">pointed out</a> that Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy, with over 10 GW of capacity, and the totality of Amazon &#8220;looks like the world at large&#8221; with its data centers, warehouses, vehicles, devices, movies and complex supply chain. &#8220;If it works for Amazon, it works for a lot of companies of smaller size,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/the-climate-pledge">Amazon Climate Pledge</a> was joined by over 200 corporations, and several tech giants like <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/about/environment">Shopify</a> are standing out with further action toward decarbonization of both direct and indirect emissions.</p>
<p>While &#8220;geography is destiny&#8221; for renewable energy — the amount of sun, wind and rivers a country has can’t be changed — some countries are also worth paying attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singapore, home of the sovereign fund Temasek, has the unique situation of being a developed nation with very limited natural resources and imports almost all its food and energy. The way it handles this <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/climate-change-wicked-problem/">wicked problem</a> is likely to provide insights to the rest of the world. As a start, it was the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/singapore-issues-first-regulatory-approval-for-lab-grown-meat-to-eat-just.html">first country to allow the sale of cell-cultured meat</a> last December.</li>
<li>Iceland gets most of its electricity from hydroelectric and geothermal power. Already attractive to the power-hungry crypto-mining industry, it could also become the carbon-capture center of the world.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Climate is everywhere</h2>
<p>Every industry wants green solutions. The summit highlighted innovators in some of the key sectors we need to decarbonize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy storage: <a href="https://formenergy.com">Form Energy</a>, <a href="http://redwoodmaterials.com">Redwood Materials</a>, <a href="https://heliogen.com">Heliogen</a> and <a href="https://www.energyvault.com">Energy Vault.</a></li>
<li>Food and agtech: <a href="https://www.upsidefoods.com">Upside Foods</a> for meat, <a href="https://shiokmeats.com">Shiok Meats</a> for seafood and <a href="https://www.pivotbio.com">Pivot Bio</a> for fertilizers.</li>
<li>Industry: <a href="https://www.bostonmetal.com/">Boston Metal</a> for steel, <a href="https://sublime-systems.com/">Sublime Systems</a> for cement, <a href="https://www.spintex.co.uk/">Spintex</a> and <a href="https://unspun.io/">unspun</a> for fashion, and <a href="http://noya.co">Noya</a> and <a href="https://www.novonutrients.com">Novonutrients</a> for carbon capture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Form Energy’s Jaramillo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7oSRkPVr54">said</a> that a running joke these days is: &#8220;Your next job is going to be in climate whether you know it or not.&#8221;</p>
<h2>We need hopeful inspiration</h2>
<p>Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of <a href="https://lanzatech.com">Lanzatech</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0ahxf6I-2E">said,</a> &#8220;We’re going to get this done. We have to get this done!&#8221;</p>
<p>The final thoughts were from sci-fi and climate fiction author Chen Qiufan, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waste-Tide-Chen-Qiufan/dp/0765389312">&#8220;Waste Tide&#8221;</a> and the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/ai-luminary-kai-fu-lee-and-sci-fi-author-chen-qiufan-predict-the-future-in-ai-2041/">&#8220;AI 2041&#8221;</a> (co-authored with investor and AI expert, Kai-Fu Lee): &#8220;There are already so many dystopian ideas. We need to write about a positive and bright future to inspire young generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>In our survey of the SOSV Climate Tech Summit’s attendees, 78.8% reported that they feel optimistic about the future after the summit. Another 15.4% answered &#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; while a mere 5.8% felt we were all doomed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Apple launched the Apple Watch, they made a big hoopla out of teaching its consumers how excited it was about having a &#8220;digital crown&#8221; and &#8220;complications&#8221;. To the watch lovers among us, that was a head-scratcher &#8212; <em>of course</em> a watch has all of those things.</p>
<p>At the time, Apple was falling victim to its heritage as a computing company. In short &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t creating a smartwatch &#8212; it was creating a tiny iPhone you carry around on your wrist, while desperately trying to convince everybody that &#8220;yes, this is a wristwatch, we promise!&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230844" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230844" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230844" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg 4405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04890.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230844" class="wp-caption-text">Withings&#8217; Health Mate app is exceptional, especially if you use more than one of the Withings health products.

<p>I&#8217;ve seen the parallel in the car world as well: A lot of the traditional car manufacturers scratched their heads and thought, &#8220;How can we cram a truckload of batteries and an electric drive train into one of our cars,&#8221; whereas some car manufacturers &#8212; Tesla in particular &#8212; essentially took the challenge differently. Tesla&#8217;s approach was, &#8220;What if we could take an iPhone, which just gets better with time as more software updates become available &#8212; and build a car around it.&#8221; The result, for Tesla, is a car that looks and feels spectacularly different than most of the other cars. Whether or not you prefer the interior and ownership experience of a Tesla or the newest generation of Mercedes electrical car boils down to a lot of things, but in my mind, it&#8217;s about a general philosophy and approach to design and functionality.</p>
<p>All of which brings us to the ScanWatch. Withings has always taken a different approach than Apple. With its relatively minimalist watches that actually look and feel like timepieces, it came at the same problem Apple was trying to solve, but the way a watchmaker would do it. How do you build a great, functional watch that looks and feels like a watch, but adds a dollop of smart features? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/10/withings-steel-hr-review/">Its Steel HR showed what was to come</a>, and the Withings ScanWatch is a natural and more ambitious step up the ladder from there.</p>
<p>The upshot of the different design philosophy is that you can&#8217;t use the Withings ScanWatch as a remote control to take photos with your phone. You can&#8217;t talk to it or use it to send texts. You can&#8217;t use it to read emails or play music or record voice memos. And if those things are important to you, well, the Withings ScanWatch simply isn&#8217;t for you &#8212; you&#8217;re not looking for a smart wristwatch, you&#8217;re looking for a microscopic supercomputer.</p>

<p>Having spent a little while with Withing&#8217;s top-of-the-line smart wristwatch, I found myself being delighted time and time again, both for all the things it is, but &#8212; most importantly &#8212; for all the things it is not. I stopped wearing an Apple watch because I disliked the design (it&#8217;s a soulless black square &#8212; much like a smartphone) and I hated the fact that it kept buzzing and notifying me of messages and tweets and emails. Yes, you can turn those things off, but if you turn off all the smartphone-extension features of the Apple Watch, you eventually end up with very little that makes the watch worth carrying around, especially when you have to charge it every day.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230789" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230789" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230789" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ScanWatch_Image-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230789" class="wp-caption-text">The Withings ScanWatch comes in two sizes, with a 38 mm and 42 mm watch face. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Withings</p></div></p>
<p>Withings&#8217; ScanWatch is the exact opposite. For one, it looks like a simple, minimalist wristwatch. If the little PMOLED display is off, you would be forgiven for thinking it was a high-end, understated timepiece from one of the many high-end watch manufacturers. The display isn&#8217;t a fancy retina display, but the trade-off is that you get up to a month of battery life. The watch feels like a wristwatch, too &#8212; heavier than you would think, but in a way that feels reassuring to me. You know that it is there, and if you&#8217;re used to wearing high-quality timepieces, that&#8217;s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>The ScanWatch also brings a ton of extremely high-end tech to a wristwatch, focusing primarily on health and wellness features &#8212; they are an extension of its fitness tracker roots, rather than extending the functionality of your phone.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230846" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230846" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230846" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04867-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230846" class="wp-caption-text">Withings&#8217; ScanWatch brings a ton of medical-grade trackers to your wrist. The EKG functionality is the crown jewel of the watch/app combo. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The watch has been available in Europe for a while, and the reason for the delay for its U.S. launch further illustrates how different this device is from its competitors. To launch, it needed clearance from the FDA. Its built-in EKG is high-quality enough, the company claims, to be able to detect <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">atrial fibrillation (afib)</a>, one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias &#8212; and a leading cause of stroke, heart failure and other heart issues.</p>
<p>To offer that data to you as a consumer, the company claims you need a prescription, and for the first EKG measurement to be analyzed by a medical professional &#8212; it isn&#8217;t entirely clear how other smartwatch manufacturers with similar EKG functionality get around this, or whether Withings is doing something fundamentally different.</p>
<p>Activating the EKG approval process is free, and you will not be charged whether you are approved or not for continued EKG use. In the meantime, the company is working to make the EKG functionality fully available to users without a prescription or additional costs, presumably by mirroring what Apple, Samsung and the others are doing to get their FDA ducks in a row.</p>
<p>If that all sounds a little over the top, well, you wouldn&#8217;t be the first to make that observation. The company went on the defensive before the watch was even released, and <a href="https://support.withings.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407741101457-ScanWatch-Frequently-asked-questions-about-ECG-US-users-only-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ended up publishing a FAQ especially addressing the EKG functionality</a>.</p>
<p>In my mind, it serves to highlight the company&#8217;s ambitions to be a health-first device. It fits in very well with the rest of the company&#8217;s devices &#8212; it sells <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart sleep trackers</a>, <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/blood-pressure-monitors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood pressure cuffs</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/withings-incredibly-sophisticated-thermometer-is-now-available/">smart thermometers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/withings-smart-body-analyzer-review/">body-fat-measuring scales</a>, for example &#8212; and the excellent Withings Health Mate app that powers all of Withings&#8217; devices is vying for your attention as the central hub as your physical health.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230850" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230850" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230850" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC04849-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230850" class="wp-caption-text">Withings&#8217; ScanWatch comes in two sizes. This is the 38 mm version, which feels about right-sized on my &#8220;do you even lift, bro?&#8221;-sized wrists. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The sum of all of this is a truly exceptional (time)piece of technology. The watch crams heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen monitoring, the EKG functionality, step, workout and activity trackers, connected GPS, an altimeter, sleep trackers, smart wake-up alarms and much more, all into a sexy, easy-to-forget device that lives on your wrist.</p>
<p>As a tech reviewer, I don&#8217;t have the medical expertise to determine whether all of these features are as good as the company claims they are. From conversations I&#8217;ve had with medical professionals, the general consensus seems to be that it isn&#8217;t as good as the multi-thousand-dollar industrial medical equipment that lives in your doctor&#8217;s office. Frankly, that would be unreasonable in a $300 consumer-grade item you carry around on your arm.</p>
<p>If you are a health and fitness-forward person who cares about style, it&#8217;s hard to go wrong with the Withings ScanWatch. It&#8217;s an incredible leap forward in wrist-carriable technology and a breath of fresh, well-oxygenated blood into a category that was starting to get a little hypoxic.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, while I was glad to see the back of my Apple Watch when I put it on eBay a few years ago, I will buy a ScanWatch with my own money once this review unit goes back to Withings; high praise from someone who approaches a lot of gadgets with a backpack full of skepticism these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.soliduslabs.com/">Solidus Labs</a>, a four-year-old, New York-based company that says its surveillance and risk-monitoring software can detect manipulation across cryptocurrency trading platforms, has raised $15 million in additional funding just six months after closing its Series A round with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/this-crypto-surveillance-startup-were-bomb-sniffing-dogs-just-raised-series-a-funding/">$20 million</a> in funding. Liberty City Ventures led the newest tranche, joined by Exor Seeds and the crypto trading firm GSR.</p>
<p>We talked last week with firm cofounder and CEO Asaf Meir, who created the company with several former colleagues at Goldman Sachs, who worked with Meir on the firm&#8217;s electronic trading desk and came to quickly appreciate that a lack of compliance tools would be a barrier to the adoption of cryptocurrencies by bigger financial institutions.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Meir said that since announcing that round, the company has &#8220;been hammered with different inbound prospects.&#8221; While earlier this year, Solidus was working mostly with exchanges, broker dealers, OTC desks, liquidity providers and regulators — anyone who is exposed to the risk of buying and selling digital assets &#8212; that pool ballooned pretty fast subsequently.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231294" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>More specifically, he said Solidus has been hearing from more players who have ties to &#8212; and concerns about &#8212; the world of DeFi, or decentralized finance, made up of all kinds of non-custodial financial products, including (in Meir&#8217;s words) &#8220;automated market-making liquidity pools, lending networks, indexes, stable coins &#8212; there is a lot of demand coming from different directions.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fsYpkiZ4ex"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/this-crypto-surveillance-startup-were-bomb-sniffing-dogs-just-raised-series-a-funding/">This crypto monitoring startup &#8212; &#8216;We&#8217;re bomb-sniffing dogs&#8217; &#8212; just raised Series A funding</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This crypto monitoring startup &#8212; &#8216;We&#8217;re bomb-sniffing dogs&#8217; &#8212; just raised Series A funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/this-crypto-surveillance-startup-were-bomb-sniffing-dogs-just-raised-series-a-funding/embed/#?secret=fsYpkiZ4ex" data-secret="fsYpkiZ4ex" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Why is this a new bucket of interest for Solidus Labs? Because it&#8217;s full of risk. Meir cites &#8220;rug pulls&#8221; and &#8220;sandwich attacks,&#8221; front running and &#8220;flash loan attacks,&#8221; and he observes that these are &#8220;just the tip of the iceberg.&#8221; And while he declines to name Solidus&#8217;s customers (which would reveal a lot about who is most concerned about this experimental space), he notes that if &#8220;DeFi doesn&#8217;t address widespread concerns about market integrity and consumer protection, it will not be able to deliver on its promise of better financial opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solidus isn&#8217;t alone in trying to help its customers identify and anticipate fraud. After all, every financial market is a target, and cryptocurrency markets are in many ways more vulnerable because there are still comparatively few regulations governing them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That chaos has led the rise of Chainalysis, a seven-year old company whose blockchain analysis software flags regulatory risks to cryptocurrency exchanges, government agencies and financial institutions and was valued by its investors at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/chainalysis-taps-another-100-million-in-white-hot-crypto-market">$4.2 billion</a> earlier this year after closing its most recent round of funding.</p>
<p>Another startup that is now selling blockchain compliance and data analytics to government agencies, financial institutions, researchers and investors called Elementus is also picking up traction. The crypto forensic outfit announced <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/28/palantir-linked-elementus-raises-12m-for-crypto-intelligence-platform/">$12 million</a> in Series A funding last month.</p>
<p>Elliptic, an eight-year-old, London-based outfit that similarly promises customers that it can identify illicit activity on the Bitcoin blockchain and that provides its services to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies, has also benefited from the massive uptick in interest in crypto and other digital assets. Last month, it announcing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-analytics-firm-elliptic-raises-60-mln-softbank-others-2021-10-11/">$60 million</a> in new funding, including from SoftBank and Wells Fargo, a round that brought its total funding to roughly $100 million, per Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>There is seemingly plenty of room for growth for all, and indeed, Meir says that Solidus intends to operate as an independent company.</p>
<p>Still, if that changed, the outfit wouldn&#8217;t be the first to sell to a deep-pocketed acquirer. Another rival in the space, six-year-old, Menlo Park, Ca.-based CipherTrace, raised roughly $45 million from investors before deciding in early September to sell to Mastercard for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/mastercard-to-buy-blockchain-analytics-start-up-ciphertrace.html">undisclosed terms</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rent the Runway is more than 10 years old now and has raised upwards of $500 million, recently filing to IPO at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">a valuation north of $1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Jenny Fleiss is a co-founder at Rent the Runway and sits on the board of several notable companies, including Shutterfly, Party City and, of course, Rent the Runway. She&#8217;s also a partner at Volition Capital alongside Larry Cheng.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft is <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2021/11/imagining-a-new-era-of-education">making its play for the new shape of classrooms</a> with a pared-down version of Windows 11 and a set of inexpensive laptops from the Surface brand and several other manufacturers. It&#8217;s clear they&#8217;ve got Google&#8217;s popular Chromebooks in their sights, and their partners seem to be hedging their bets as well.</p>
<p>Before all that, let&#8217;s just establish that &#8220;SE&#8221; doesn&#8217;t stand for anything, unlike the SE in Windows 98 SE (&#8220;second edition&#8221;) or the iPhone SE (&#8220;special edition&#8221;) or the Macintosh SE (&#8220;system expansion&#8221;). The SE is &#8220;intended to clearly differentiate it from other editions like Home and Pro,&#8221; Microsoft told me, though why the they didn&#8217;t just say it stands for &#8220;Students and Educators&#8221; instead of being a completely meaningless initialism is beyond me. (Yes, Microsoft, you can steal that.)</p>
<p>Whatever the origin of its name, the Surface Laptop SE we may take to be the platonic shape or reference design of what Microsoft is hoping to achieve here: a $250 laptop with all the basics, but designed with the remote classroom and ease of repair in mind.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230926" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The specs won&#8217;t wow anybody, but this is intended to be a homework and remote learning machine, not a 4K VFX workstation. Let&#8217;s just have a few bullets here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Celeron N4020 or N4120 series with integrated graphics</li>
<li>4 or 8 GB of RAM</li>
<li>64 or 128 GB of storage in an eMMC (and therefore not expandable)</li>
<li>720p webcam with &#8220;improved facial awareness&#8221;</li>
<li>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</li>
<li>1x USB-A, 1x USB-C, 3.5mm headphone jack</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s a missed opportunity to use the USB-C for charging (there&#8217;s a separate port for an old-school cylindrical power connector), but it&#8217;s more or less what you&#8217;d expect from a machine at this price.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2230976" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg" alt="Microsoft's Surface Laptop SE with two applications open." width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=2048,1229 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/surface-laptop-se-2.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Except for the 11.6&#8243;, 1366&#215;768 display. Of course this is intended for kids, but still, Chromebooks at this price have 1080p screens, which is a big improvement for text clarity and video quality, two things you want to optimize for in a laptop like this.</p>
<p>The company did say that it is bringing the solid keyboard from its nicer laptops down to this device, which is good news. And the focus on repairability is welcome as well: &#8220;vital components like the display, battery, keyboard – even the motherboard – can be easily repaired onsite, saving time and money for IT admins and schools,&#8221; Microsoft wrote.</p>
<p>Other devices are on the way from Acer, ASUS, Dell, Dynabook, Fujitsu, HP, JP-IK, Lenovo, and Positivo, with both Intel and AMD options and no doubt a bit of variance in specs. They&#8217;re not necessarily new (Dynabook&#8217;s E10 came out earlier this year, for instance) but are compatible with the new OS.</p>
<p>To wit, all these laptops will be running Windows 11 SE, a version of the OS that&#8217;s intended to be easy for schools to deploy en masse. It has been optimized for the hardware noted above and can be provisioned quickly and simply, with Microsoft 365 and other commonly used apps and services pre-loaded. School IT is also the only one that can add and remove apps, and can control web access as well. Automatic updates, cloud management, the whole enchilada.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230977" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230977" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2230977" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/w11SE_snap3.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2230977" class="wp-caption-text">Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 11 SE showing two apps pinned side by side.</p></div></p>
<p>In the announcement post, Microsoft notes that internet access at home is not necessarily something that every student can rely on. So they made sure that the built-in apps don&#8217;t have to phone home to work. 365 apps will work offline and OneDrive will store changes locally, syncing them once it connects to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Microsoft has had mixed luck with these limited forks of its flagship OS. Windows RT was the most famous flop, but 11 SE is very different — sure, it&#8217;s made to run on specific hardware and locks down a lot of basic features, but it&#8217;s intended for a particular market that actually wants those things.</p>
<p>Netbooks, too, were something of a flash in the pan and not much good to anybody, but nowadays you can do a lot more with a barebones PC and a browser. Hopefully these modest notebooks will make it into the hands of students and do a bit to improve the rather uneven present situation with remote learning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In an interview today at the <a href="https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/">NYT Dealbook Conference,</a> Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed the company was looking into cryptocurrency, but clarified it had no &#8220;immediate&#8221; plans to launch any crypto-related offerings. While Cook wouldn&#8217;t detail any of the areas where the company may be exploring crypto, he did note there were several areas of Apple&#8217;s business where he would not consider introducing crypto offerings.</p>
<p>Asked by interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin if Apple would consider accepting cryptocurrency through Apple Pay &#8220;or otherwise,&#8221; Cook replied broadly that crypto is &#8220;something that we&#8217;re looking at.&#8221; He then went on to explain that Apple has decided where it doesn&#8217;t make sense to invest in cryptocurrencies, even if it&#8217;s not ready to speak publicly about crypto products.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would sort of characterize it as there are things I wouldn&#8217;t do &#8212; like our cash balance. I wouldn&#8217;t go invest that in crypto &#8212; not because I wouldn&#8217;t invest my own money in crypto &#8212; but because I don&#8217;t think people buy an Apple stock to get exposure to crypto. And so, if they want to do that, they can invest directly in crypto through other means,&#8221; Cook explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231270" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cook also noted Apple had no plans to take crypto for its products, as a means of tender.</p>
<p>However, he did firmly state that crypto was on the company&#8217;s radar, saying &#8220;there are other things that we&#8217;re definitely looking at,&#8221; with regard to crypto, but said Apple had nothing to announce on the matter at this time.</p>
<p>Apple Pay competitors like PayPal, Venmo, and Square Inc.&#8217;s Cash app have all moved into the crypto space in recent months, so it would be odd if Apple wasn&#8217;t at least weighing a decision about making a similar move. And Cook himself has no real opposition to crypto investments, confirming to interviewer Sorkin that he, himself, invests in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s reasonable to own it as a part of a diversified portfolio,&#8221; Cook said, adding with a laugh, &#8220;I&#8217;m not giving anybody investment advice by the way.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The exec continued by saying he&#8217;s been interested in cryptocurrency for some time.</p>
<p>He added also that he thinks NFTs are interesting but thinks they will take a while to play out in a way that&#8217;s interesting to a mainstream person.</p>
<p>The larger interview touched on other timely topics of importance to Apple and the larger tech industry, including Apple&#8217;s position on security, privacy, and the opening of the App Store &#8212; something Epic Games is suing over, in an antitrust court battle now under appeal.</p>
<p>Cook was straight to the point on this matter of user choice, noting that users already have a choice when they buy a phone. If they want to load apps outside of an app store environment &#8212; a practice known as sideloading &#8212; there&#8217;s another platform that allows that, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people have that choice today&#8230;because if you want to sideload, you can buy an Android phone,&#8221; said Cook. &#8220;That choice exists. When you go into the carrier shop, if that&#8217;s important to you, then you should buy an Android phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Apple&#8217;s opinion, sideloading is too risky, he said. Of course, it&#8217;s also an avenue for Apple to lose out on millions of dollars that today flow through the App Store and in-app purchases, where it gets a cut of developer revenues.</p>
<p>Cook also spoke generally about his excitement for AR technologies, but didn&#8217;t comment on Facebook&#8217;s recent VR plans with Meta or any potential Apple projects involving automobiles, noting that Apple tries not to talk about the future too much.</p>
<p>He additionally detailed Apple&#8217;s stance on politics, noting the company doesn&#8217;t have a PAC, and defended Apple&#8217;s serving of the Chinese market.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that we have a responsibility as a business to do business in as many places as we can, because I think business is this huge catalyst, he said. &#8220;I think we should be about not pulling up the drawbridge. We should be about building the bridges. And I think that&#8217;s key for business. In terms of what we speak up on, we speak up on some privately, we speak up on some publicly &#8212; we do it in different ways,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, is launching today in the U.S. as well as New Zealand, offering an expanded slate of features meant to appeal to Twitter&#8217;s most engaged users. The service will be available across iOS, Android and the web for $2.99 per month (or $4.49 NZD). Twitter Blue first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-launches-its-premium-subscription-twitter-blue-initially-in-canada-and-australia/">arrived</a> this summer in Canada and Australia, giving subscribers a set of tools to organize their bookmarks, read Twitter threads in a clutter-free format, and quickly fix typos before tweets were posted, among other things. With the expanded rollout, Twitter Blue will also enable early access to new features via the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/twitter-blue-introduces-labs-to-give-users-early-access-to-new-features/">recently launched Twitter Labs</a>, and it will offer ad-free news articles from hundreds of publishers, thanks to Twitter&#8217;s springtime <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">acquisition of Scroll</a>.</p>
<p>And, as an added perk, Twitter is bringing back Scroll&#8217;s news aggregator Nuzzel as a new feature called &#8220;Top Articles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nuzzel had a small but devoted user base, who had been disappointed to see Twitter had closed down their favorite service following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">its buyout</a> of Nuzzel&#8217;s parent company Scroll. The service had acted as a missing curation layer to Twitter&#8217;s tweets by showing users what people you were connected with on Twitter were reading about and sharing across the platform. This served as a more personalized way to tune into what was being discussed compared with just scrolling through Twitter&#8217;s trends.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230630" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Today, Twitter says it will make this same feature available to Twitter Blue subscribers as Top Articles. The feature will allow users to see the most shared articles in their network over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The addition joins other <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">now standard Twitter Blue offerings</a>, including the ability to sort saved tweets (aka &#8220;Bookmarks&#8221;) into folders for easier access, the ability to customize Twitter&#8217;s theme, choose a custom app icon, and view long Twitter threads in a cleaned-up, distraction-free reading experience with just tap.</p>

<p>And of course, Twitter Blue gives subscribers the closest thing you&#8217;ll get to Twitter&#8217;s most-requested feature &#8212; an &#8220;edit&#8221; button &#8212; with its alternative, an &#8220;Undo Tweet&#8221; button. This allows users to catch a typo and fix it before the tweet is fully posted, but not correct tweets that are already live.</p>

<p>Twitter Blue also includes a few personalization features as well, including theming, custom icons, and now, the ability to customize the app&#8217;s bottom navigation tab with your own favorite Twitter destinations, like Twitter Spaces, Bookmarks, Top Articles, Lists, Monetization, and others. This may make Twitter feel more personalized to you, but limits Twitter&#8217;s ability to place new features it may want to promote in key spots in the app going forward.</p>

<p>Subscribers also gain access to Twitter Labs, which is where Twitter will roll out its early-stage experiments first. At launch, Twitter Labs offers longer, 10-minute video uploads from the web (instead of 2 minutes for non-subscribers), and the ability to pin favorite Direct Message (DM) conversations to the top of the inbox, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/twitter-blue-introduces-labs-to-give-users-early-access-to-new-features/">both of which were previously announced</a>.</p>

<p>Another new feature is the ability to read news articles shared on Twitter without advertising and clutter. This feature is also enabled through Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">acquisition</a> of Scroll, and essentially works the same way as Scroll had. The company partnered with hundreds of publishers to offer a fast-loading, ad-free reading experience to Twitter Blue subscribers who click the links they come across on the platform. Among the notable names participating are The Washington Post, BuzzFeed and BuzzFeed News, Rolling Stone, Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, IndieWire, Huffpost, The Atlantic, Insider, USA Today, MacRumors, BGR, Slate, Daily Beast, Miami Herald, Stylecaster, TV Line, Salon, Mother Jones, The Sacramento Bee, The Philadelphia Inquirer, SEJ, and others.</p>
<p>When Twitter Blue members click news links to these sites, the publisher itself will serve the ad-free reading experience to the user &#8212; not Twitter. Currently, Twitter says it has 300 U.S.-based sites up and running on Twitter Blue and &#8220;many more&#8221; will arrive in the future.</p>

<p>Quick loading, clutter-free articles is a feature that other tech giants have offered, including Facebook with its Instant Articles and Google with AMP. But these earlier efforts have been controversial for <a href="https://searchengineland.com/whether-google-manipulated-amp-or-not-its-a-great-time-to-reassess-using-it-375597">locking publishers into</a> the format, which could then dictate their visibility on the respective platform. They were also sometimes <a href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/are-facebook-instant-articles-worth-it.php">criticized</a> for not delivering on their promises, like increased monetization, and for offering publishers limited user data.</p>
<p>Twitter, however, touts its news reading feature as a way for subscribers to support their favorite sites, as a portion of the Twitter Blue subscription will be paid out directly to the participating publishers. The app will display a chart that shows you which sites have received payments based on your own readership, and how much they&#8217;ve made.</p>
<p>The plan, says Twitter, is to make the micro-payments deliver more revenue than ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is that each site makes 50% more per person than they were making serving ads to that person,&#8221; said Twitter Senior Direct of Product, Tony Haile, when introducing the feature. &#8220;At Twitter, we recognize that a great public conversation requires a thriving journalism ecosystem. So with Blue, we&#8217;re not just trying to enable a better internet for subscribers, but a better internet for journalism, too,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>But these micro-payments may not go far enough in terms of replacing the potential monetization that comes from having readers visit a site directly, where they&#8217;ll encounter not only ads, but other promotions and initiatives a site has to offer &#8212; like subscriptions, free and paid newsletters, event tickets, or whatever else the publisher may want to put in front of its audience. Twitter Blue readers may also not be able to recirculate through the site as web visitors do, decreasing overall engagement.</p>

<p>Twitter notes that some of Twitter Blue&#8217;s features will vary by market and platform, at launch.</p>
<p>Top Articles is initially live on Android and desktop at launch. Personalization features like app icons and themes are iOS only, as is custom navigation and pinned DM conversations. Support for longer video uploads from the web, obviously, is desktop-only.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s launch, Twitter Blue is now available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The company says it plans to offer the subscription in other markets, but couldn&#8217;t comment on those plans at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last night, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky took to Twitter to share what he&#8217;s seeing in the company&#8217;s data. The broad strokes version was that the pandemic-induced flexibility in our work lives has allowed more people to travel during the week, and even travel for months at a time, effectively living on Airbnb.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">13. So basically, people aren’t just traveling on Airbnb, they’re now living on Airbnb</p>
<p>&mdash; Brian Chesky (@bchesky) <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1457907074822664193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>To respond to this behavior change, Airbnb is today releasing a broad variety of new features to the platform.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig in.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest challenges with the renewed interest in travel, and the desire to travel and live anywhere for longer periods of time, is that supply has to meet demand. Airbnb wants to make sure that there are enough hosts to handle changing customer demand preferences, so it&#8217;s investing in making their experience better. To offer hosts more protection, Airbnb is introducing AirCover.</p>
<p>AirCover is top-to-bottom coverage for the home and is now free to all hosts on the platform. It&#8217;s up to $1 million in damage protection and $1 million in liability coverage. This also includes income loss protection, pet damage protection and deep cleaning protection.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The coverage product offers a 14-day filing window and promises faster reimbursements to hosts who file a claim, with an even faster track for Superhosts.</p>
<p>Airbnb&#8217;s Host Protection plan, which has been around for a long time now, has always offered up to $1 million in both damage protection and liability coverage, but there were plenty of gaps in that coverage. For example, income loss for superhosts who needed to take time off of the platform or cancel bookings for repairs were not covered for the loss of that income. Damage caused by pets was also not included in the coverage.</p>
<p>Pet damage coverage will indeed be a big one for hosts and guests alike. The pandemic led many folks to get themselves a furry friend, and now those same folks want to travel. But hosts, for good reason, are not often keen on allowing pets into their properties, which is again creating a big gap between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Pet damage protection should naturally readjust that imbalance.</p>
<p>AirCover is actually a pretty huge deal in that it expands beyond Host Protection, which covered the structure of the home but not the property inside of it. AirCover covers <em>most</em> of the goods in the home, with several exclusions like fine art, currency, automobiles and other vehicles like boats and jets, weapons, security cameras and precious metals and/or jewelry. Even with these exclusions, it&#8217;s a huge step up from the original policy, which didn&#8217;t cover things like furniture damage or theft of items.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/2869/host-damage-protection-terms?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1627985030_kwjAf1dGo8hyan9W" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full list of exclusions here</a>.</p>
<p>For those interested in the nitty gritty, Airbnb&#8217;s AirCover is provided through a policy issued by Zurich Insurance plc in most locations. In some jurisdictions, where a locally issued policy is required by regulation, coverage may be provided by a Zurich Insurance plc partner company, according to Airbnb.</p>

<p>Alongside AirCover, Airbnb is also introducing a Translation Engine. The engine translates in more than 60 languages, and removes &#8220;click to translate&#8221; buttons by automatically translating listing descriptions and reviews to the user&#8217;s language of choice. Not only does the Translation Engine remove the need to click to translate, but it actually translates better, according to the company.</p>

<p>Accessibility Review and Verified Wifi are two new features aimed at accuracy. Listings often say they have met accessibility requirements or that they have super-fast Wi-Fi, but fall short of expectations.</p>
<p>With Accessibility Review, hosts submit pictures of their accessibility features and they are manually reviewed by a team of actual humans. Thus far, this team has reviewed and confirmed the accuracy of 100,000 accessibility features in 25,000 homes around the world.</p>
<p>Verified Wifi allows hosts to test their listing&#8217;s connection right from Airbnb itself and have the speeds verified, so guests coming to work, and not just play, in that space can rely on their connection.</p>
<p>These new features are a few of the biggest that Airbnb is announcing today, but the company is also doubling down on products that have been immensely popular.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Flexible,&#8221; for example, has been used more than 500 million times since it was released in February 2021. Flexible search allows guests to be flexible around the location they&#8217;d like to visit, the dates they&#8217;d like to travel, and even the type of residence they&#8217;d like to stay in.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jerUFWHUBZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/airbnb-doubles-down-on-flexible-search-improves-the-host-flow-in-preparation-for-summer-2021/">Airbnb doubles down on flexible search, improves the host flow in preparation for summer 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Airbnb doubles down on flexible search, improves the host flow in preparation for summer 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/airbnb-doubles-down-on-flexible-search-improves-the-host-flow-in-preparation-for-summer-2021/embed/#?secret=jerUFWHUBZ" data-secret="jerUFWHUBZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Because people are so drawn to this flexible search concept, Airbnb is expanding the date range; you can use flexible search from six months to 12 months out. The company has also added four new categories of unique stays, including off the grid, ski-in/ski-out, luxe and offbeat homes.</p>
<p>In terms of fine-tuning the service, Airbnb has redesigned the My Trips tab to keep all the information you need in one place, including a countdown timer for your reservation, check-in details, a list of upcoming reservations and personalized Experiences suggestions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m speaking with Chesky in a couple of hours and will chat with him about this news, as well as his long-term vision for the company based on the trends he&#8217;s seeing in the travel space. I&#8217;ll update this post with a link to the interview.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sweetgreen's IPO pricing is fascinating because it fits neatly into our budding thesis regarding the value of tech-enabled companies when they go public.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sweetgreen, a fast-casual restaurant chain that attracted ample venture capital during its life as a private company, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001477815/000119312521323700/d104360ds1a.htm">set early terms for its IPO</a> this morning.</p>
<p>The well-known salad slinger expects to sell stock in its public market debut at a range of $23 to $25 per share. Inclusive of shares reserved for its underwriting banks, Sweetgreen is worth between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion at those prices. IPO-watching group Renaissance Capital <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88397/Looking-for-green-Salad-chain-Sweetgreen-sets-terms-for-$300-million-IPO">estimates</a> that at the midpoint of its IPO price range, Sweetgreen is worth $3.0 billion on a fully diluted basis; at the top end of its price range, Sweetgreen&#8217;s fully diluted valuation swells to $3.13 billion.</p>
<p>The prices are a win across the board for Sweetgreen, which last raised $156 million at a $1.78 billion post-money valuation, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">according to PitchBook data</a>. Its investors all stand to enjoy winsome markups on the capital they invested into the salad chain.</p>
<p>But the company&#8217;s IPO is notable for a far more interesting reason than that some already wealthy individuals and groups are going to have more money in short order. Sweetgreen&#8217;s IPO pricing is fascinating because it fits neatly into our budding thesis regarding the value of tech-enabled companies when they go public.</p>
<h2>Upper single digits</h2>
<p>When Rent the Runway <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/rent-the-runways-ipo-pricing-indicates-bullish-market-for-unicorns-of-all-stripes/">priced its IPO</a>, it earned a revenue multiple just over the 7x mark. It has since lost ground as a public company but still set a recent benchmark for what a tech-enabled business might be worth in a public debut. Note that the Rent multiple is not bearish; non-SaaS unicorns today can earn old-fashioned SaaS multiples, which is rather bullish, I think.</p>
<p>Allbirds was next up. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/allbirds-prices-ipo-above-range-putting-more-points-on-the-board-for-dtc-startups/">priced at $15 per share</a>, giving it what we calculated to be around a roughly 9x multiple. The company then saw its value appreciate to around $23 per share as of this morning.</p>
<p>With two upper-single-digit IPO revenue multiples for DTC companies in a row, it felt like a price range was forming. Rent declined while Allbirds rose, but their <em>IPO pricing</em> was range-setting.</p>
<p>Enter Sweetgreen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Content publishing platform <a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a> is acquiring a small startup called <a href="https://projector.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Projector</a>. As part of the deal, the entire Projector team is joining Medium with Projector’s co-founder and CEO Trevor O&#8217;Brien becoming Medium’s chief product officer.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Projector, the company has been building a browser-based graphic design tool. In just a few clicks, Projector users can create graphics for social posts, such as podcast artworks, a logo for a Facebook event, an Instagram story, etc.</p>
<p>You don’t need any professional design skills to use Projector as you can also take advantage of a library of templates. You can then replace images and text to personalize them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Some people have also been using Projector to create animated GIFs and presentations. If you want someone else to contribute, you can collaborate as a team in real-time. When you’re done, you can also share a presentation or a design with a link.</p>
<p>While Medium isn’t disclosing the terms of the acquisition, 100,000 people have used Projector and the startup had raised $23 million over three funding rounds. Upfront Ventures, Mayfield Fund, Foundry Group, Upside Partnership, Homebrew, Mantis VC and Van Wickle Ventures invested in the startup. Mark Suster and Rishi Garg served on the board of the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231277" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231277" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2231277" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/projector_effects.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="585" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231277" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Medium</p></div></p>
<p>The entire Projector team of 13 is joining Medium. Projector’s co-founder and CEO Trevor O&#8217;Brien, who previously led product teams at Coda, Twitter and YouTube, will become Medium’s chief product officer. The company didn’t have a CPO before today’s acquisition.</p>
<p>Projector’s co-founder and VP of Engineering Luke Millar will start a new role as Medium’s VP of Engineering.</p>
<p>“Medium will not keep Projector running as an independent product for the long-term. The focus is on the core Medium platform — leveraging Projector technologies and expertise to build world-class creator tools and reader experiences,” Trevor O&#8217;Brien said.</p>
<p>“That said, Projector will continue to run through March of 2022 in order to help existing customers off-board their teams, export their work and take their creations with them,” he added.</p>
<p>If Medium plans to take advantage of Projector’s experience, you can expect more design capabilities to customize your Medium sites, posts and newsletters. It could also lead to more real-time collaboration features.</p>
<p>Medium’s post editor has inspired many content management systems with its clean and intuitive design. Now, let’s see if Medium expands beyond words with the same design-focused approach for multimedia content.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Exchange gained early access to pi Ventures' Deep Tech Shifts 2026 report, which identifies 15 deep tech subsectors the firm believes will reach an inflection point by 2026.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With so much of the startup news cycle focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/vcs-are-racing-to-pay-more-to-get-smaller-pieces-of-less-profitable-companies/">unprecedented funding round sizes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/bootstrapping-in-2021-goes-a-long-way/">record amounts of time bootstrapping</a>, we don&#8217;t often step back from the numbers to have a hard think about innovation. But today, that&#8217;s precisely what we are going to do.</p>
<p>The Exchange gained early access to pi Ventures&#8217; <a href="https://www.piventures.in/deeptech-shifts-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Tech Shifts 2026 report</a>, which identifies 15 deep tech subsectors the firm believes will reach an inflection point by 2026.</p>
<p>The study is backed by research, but pi Ventures&#8217; founding partner Manish Singhal says its findings are also informed by conversations with entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2>Predicting 15 shifts</h2>
<p>Below are 15 sectors in which pi Ventures expects &#8220;disruptive innovation that will bring about key shifts in global businesses&#8221; in the next half-decade:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternative protein:</strong> superfluous to vital.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain: </strong>promising to mainstream.</li>
<li><strong>Brain-computer interface:</strong> measurement to insight.</li>
<li><strong>Climate tech:</strong> incidental to critical.</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy:</strong> identifiable to anonymous.</li>
<li><strong>Energy storage</strong>: Li-Ion to alternative chemistries.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise workflows</strong>: human to human + Al.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare screening</strong>: reactive to proactive.</li>
<li><strong>MLOps</strong>: in-house to managed services.</li>
<li><strong>Nature co-design:</strong> materials to biomaterials.</li>
<li><strong>Quantum computing:</strong> supremacy to advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Robotics:</strong> automation to cognition.</li>
<li><strong>Space tech — in-space:</strong> deployment to in-space management.</li>
<li><strong>Space tech — launch:</strong> customization to democratization.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic content creation:</strong> casual to commercial.</li>
</ul>
<p>First off, let&#8217;s clarify that &#8220;nature co-design&#8221; refers to biomaterials, and &#8220;synthetic content creation&#8221; is about AI-generated text, images and audio, which pi expects to escalate from casual use cases to commercial.</p>
<h2>A matter of timing</h2>
<p>Singhal told TechCrunch that the firm recently began deploying its second fund of $100 million — a significant step up from its initial fund, which invested $30 million in 15 companies based in or with a connection to India. This time around, pi&#8217;s goal is to invest into 25 early-stage startups.</p>
<p>Based in Bangalore, pi&#8217;s website boasts of &#8220;pioneering deep tech investments in India.&#8221; Not all the companies in its portfolio are based there, but they all have a strong connection with the country: ML-powered consumer trend prediction platform AI Palette is based in Singapore, with an engineering hub in Bangalore, while mental health app Wysa has offices in Bangalore, Boston and London.</p>
<p>Singhal says pi&#8217;s goal is to back companies that are &#8220;global innovators&#8221; — aiming beyond India or any single market and leveraging deep tech. &#8220;We want to back disruptive innovation, rather than incremental innovation,&#8221; he said. On the other end of the spectrum, pi&#8217;s site notes that it doesn&#8217;t invest in &#8220;pure science or research&#8221; — it is looking for the &#8220;intersection of scalable businesses and disruptive technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Timing is key to what pi is doing, a fact that underpins the 67 pages of its new report. &#8220;If you invest too early in an innovation, then you will have suboptimal returns,&#8221; Singhal said. &#8220;If you invest too late, you may also end up getting suboptimal returns, because it is no longer a cutting-edge thing. If investment and the timing of innovation getting to a resonance point come together, then good things happen.&#8221;</p>
<h2>A framework for inflection points</h2>
<p>This is where pi Ventures in-house framework comes in, featuring a &#8220;demand and supply resonance map&#8221; to analyze deep tech shifts. You will see it at play in the two examples we&#8217;ll explore, but the general idea is summed up in the chart below:</p>
