</div><p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;ve fundraised a lot. Tactically, fundraising is a skill like any other. You get better the more you do it. But practicing gets you nowhere if you don&#8217;t have a strong foundation in understanding a fundraising round&#8217;s core components.</p>
<p>As a founder, you will understand less than investors when it comes to fundraising. For investors, negotiating with founders is their full-time job. For founders, fundraising is just a small part of building a business. Understanding the basics of venture financing can help founders raise on better terms.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>How financing works: SAFEs versus equity rounds,</li>
<li>How much to raise</li>
<li>How to arrive at your valuation</li>
</ul>
<h2>How financing works: SAFEs versus equity rounds</h2>
<p>Venture financing takes place in rounds. The first stage is the pre-seed or seed round, then a Series A, then a Series B, then a Series C, and so on. You can continue to raise funding until the company is profitable, gets acquired or goes public.</p>
<p>We will focus here on seed-stage funding — your very first funding round.</p>
<p><strong>SAFEs</strong></p>
<p>Post-money SAFEs are the most common way to raise funding. These documents are used by Y Combinator, angel investors, and most early-stage funds. You should raise on post-money SAFEs using <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/">standard documents</a> created by YC. Standard documents have consistent terms that have been drafted to be fair to both investors and founders.</p>
<p>By using the standard post-money SAFE, your negotiation can focus on the two terms that matter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Principal: The amount you want to raise per investor.</li>
<li>Valuation cap: The value of your business.</li>
</ol>

					<description><![CDATA[Blue Origin is set to launch its fully reusable New Shepard spacecraft with humans on board for the first time on Tuesday, and it&#8217;s sending Amazon founder and billionaire Jeff Bezos up along with his brother and two record-setting astronauts.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaYIcD_rTIk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Blue Origin is set to launch its fully reusable New Shepard spacecraft with humans on board for the first time on Tuesday, and it&#8217;s sending Amazon founder and billionaire Jeff Bezos up along with his brother and two record-setting astronauts. The launch live stream above is scheduled for 6:30 AM CDT (7:30 AM EDT/4:30 AM PDT), with the actual liftoff targeted for 8 AM CDT (9 AM EDT/6 AM PDT).</p>
<p>The full flight profile includes a takeoff from Blue Origin&#8217;s remote West Texas facility, followed by an ascent to a height of roughly 62 miles above the Earth&#8217;s surface. Those on board, including Bezos, his brother Mark, 82-year old Wally Funk and 18-year old Oliver Daemen will then experience between 3 and 4 minutes of weightlessness inside the New Shepard capsule, before it returns to Earth slowed by parachutes for a touchdown in the West Texas desert and then a recovery by Blue Origin staff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is not significantly different in terms of timing or sequence from the 15 prior New Shepard flights that Blue Origin has flown, but this is the first one with humans on board (including the world&#8217;s richest), so it&#8217;s obviously the one to watch.</p>

		Jon Fingas is a contributing writer at <a href="https://www.engadget.com">Engadget</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The rumors of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warnermedia-cnn-entertainment-cable-streaming-services-200009666.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">CNN streaming service</a> were true. The network has <a href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2021/07/19/cnn-to-debut-in-q1-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">unveiled</a> a CNN+ service that will offer a blend of live and on-demand shows that are &#8220;separate and distinct&#8221; from existing TV coverage. It will debut sometime in the first quarter of 2022. CNN hasn&#8217;t narrowed down the price, but lead executive Andrew Morse told <em>Variety</em> in an <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/inside-cnn-plus-a-first-look-at-the-new-streaming-service-exclusive-1235022517/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">interview</a> that there wouldn&#8217;t be an ad-supported tier at launch.</p>
<p>The centerpiece, as you&#8217;d expect, will be the live material. CNN+ plans to offer eight to 12 hours of in-depth topical coverage and &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; material every day, with both veterans and newcomers at the helm. You&#8217;ll also have chances to interact with anchors and experts in real-time discussions. This won&#8217;t be a digital replica of CNN&#8217;s usual news, then, but you may have reasons to tune in every day.</p>
<p>The on-demand catalog unsurprisingly taps into CNN&#8217;s existing collection, including shows like <em>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</em> and <em>United Shades of America</em>. There will be original shows and movies for the internet service, although CNN+ won&#8217;t reveal those until later in 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Officially, Morse said CNN+ wouldn&#8217;t be bundled or otherwise tie into HBO Max despite the WarnerMedia connection. <em>Variety</em> sources, however, claimed there was a &#8220;strong probability&#8221; the service would be bundled with HBO Max and Discovery+ after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-discovery-185439134.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="0">WarnerMedia and Discovery</a> finalize their merger.</p>
<p>Morse considered the CNN+ launch the largest the network has had since it started TV service in June 1980. It was also a chance to experiment with formats that blur distinctions between entertainment and news, the executive added.</p>
<p>The question, of course, is whether or not viewers will bite. CNN has had success with long-form content like the late Anthony Bourdain&#8217;s shows, but it&#8217;s not clear if people are ready to pay a monthly fee to see them. There&#8217;s also the matter of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-please-stop-making-streaming-services.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">streaming service overload</a> — you might not be thrilled to subscribe to yet another offering just to be sure you catch everything CNN has to offer.</p>

The company is more than doubling the number of service areas this week to north of 400 cities and towns. It now serves several major markets through the Uber and Uber Eats apps, including San Francisco, New York City and Washington DC.</p>
<p>The rapid expansion was partly fueled by a partnership with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-search-maps-covid-19-vaccines-pharmacies-160024114.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>Albertsons Companies</ins></a> and its 1,200 grocery stores across the country. Albertsons owns brands including Safeway, Jewel-Osco, Acme, Tom Thumb and Randalls. Uber also offers delivery from regional chains such as Southeastern Grocers and New York’s Red Apple Group. Uber Pass and Eats Pass subscribers don&#8217;t need to pay delivery fees on grocery orders over $30.</p>
<p>Grocery delivery became an important component of Uber&#8217;s business during the toughest parts of the COVID-19 pandemic, because the number of rides people were taking dropped significantly. The company is also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-lyft-surge-pricing-lack-of-drivers-035835230.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><ins>dealing with a driver shortage</ins></a> that led to higher prices for rides.

<p>Gopalan&#8217;s resignation comes after months of internal drama and business setbacks for a company that has been considered the leading supplier of lidar, the light detection and ranging radar sensor that is considered a critical component to commercially deploy autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>The resignation is the latest in a series of issues that have cropped up since Velodyne Lidar struck a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/velodyne-becomes-latest-tech-company-to-go-public-using-a-spac-eschewing-the-traditional-ipo-path/"> deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company</a> Graf Industrial Corp. At the time, it was reported that <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Velodyne&#8217;s founder David Hall, along with backers Ford, Chinese search engine Baidu, Hyundai Mobis and Nikon Corp. would keep an 80% stake in the combined company. Hall became executive chairman and Gopalan remained CEO position.</span></p>

<p>Hall and his wife Marta Thoma Hall clashed with the SPAC that acquired Velodyne. In February, David Hall was <a href="https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-announces-changes-to-board-of-directors/">removed as chairman of the board</a> and Marta Thoma Hall lost her chief marketing officer position following an investigation by the board of &#8220;inappropriate behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ford, which had held almost 13.1 million shares — a value of about $244 million — in Velodyne at the close of the third quarter of 2020,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000110465921021932/tm213752d1_sc13ga.htm"> sold off its stake</a> by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Velodyne sensors had been used by Ford in its autonomous vehicle testing. The intention was that those would be the go-to sensor for its autonomous vehicles once they were deployed commercially.</p>
<p>Veoneer had even announced in 2019 that it was leveraging Velodyne&#8217;s technology for a contract to supply the sensor to Ford (and by extension its autonomous vehicle technology supplier Argo AI). But Veoneer reported in February that it had lost its contract.</p>
<p>Argo, which had acquired lidar company Princeton Lightwave, unveiled in May<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/argos-new-lidar-sensor-could-help-ford-vw-deploy-self-driving-vehicles-at-scale/"> details on a long-range lidar sensor</a> that it claims has the ability to see 400 meters away with high-resolution photorealistic quality and the ability to detect dark and distant objects with low reflectivity. With so much progress internally, Argo and Ford staked their future plans on its own lidar.</p>

<p>In a May letter, David Hall blamed the SPAC, specifically the SPAC-appointed members of the combined company&#8217;s board, for its poor financial performance and called for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453138/velodyne-david-hall-spac-letter-board-removal">resignation of Gopalan and two board members</a>.</p>
<p>As part of Velodyne&#8217;s announcement on Gopalan&#8217;s resignation, the company restated its business outlook for 2021 revenue, noting that its guidance of between $77 million and $94 million remains unchanged. Velodyne will report second quarter financial results August 5.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve just sat down to dinner, and your wearable device reminds you to get up and get in your steps for the day. Maybe the app has a point, but odds are, you’ll push the notification to the side. The founders of Sweetch, an Israeli company creating its own AI-driven behavior change app, are betting that if you got that notification in a different way, you’ll be more likely to take its advice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yossi Bahagon, the founder of Sweetch, describes the company’s approach to digital reminders as a mixture of artificial intelligence and emotional intelligence. The app will use AI to analyse “lifeprint” data picked up through a smartphone. Then it delivers messages to when you might be more likely to respond to them and in a “tone of voice” that encourages compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance if you have meetings on Mondays between 12 and 3, but still want to get in some exercise, Sweetch won’t suggest getting a workout in during those times, or shame you for sitting through a meeting rather than getting a run in. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s about ongoing hyper-personalized engagement that increases the likelihood of the patient doing what he or she needs to do,” says Bahagon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Sweetch announced a $20 million Series A round led by Entreé Capital. Other investors include Noaber, Kortex Ventures, Insurtech VC, Fin TLV Ventures, and existing investors Philips, OurCrowd, and Qure Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bahagon is a family physician by training, but he’s spent the majority of his career in the digital health arena. In 2008 Bagahon founded the digital health division of Clalit Health Services, a non-profit insurance and medical services provider that currently insures </span><a href="https://www.mor-research.com/clalit-at-a-glance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60 percent of the Israeli population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His previous company, Luminox Health, was acquired by Israeli investor platform OurCrowd in 2016, and Bahagon stayed on to manage the fund’s digital health arm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweetch, which was founded in 2013, is yet another digital health venture for Bahagon –  this time aimed at increased patient compliance. The app has already generated some interest, and was one of five apps selected from over 400 to participate in the </span><a href="https://media.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-initiates-new-G4A-Digital-Health-Partnerships-Program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bayer G4A program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, something like an accelerator developed by the pharmaceutical giant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Sweetch CEO Yoni Nevo says the app has “tens of thousands of users,” (the company would not provide a specific number). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s currently being used in patients with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and, in a bit of a departure from the rest: breast cancer treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweetch isn’t designed for users to download at will on the app store (you can download it, but won’t get far without an access code); their go-to market strategy is instead to partner with healthcare organizations, pharma companies, payers or providers. Then providers might prescribe Sweetch alongside the actual treatment to encourage them to stick with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is evidence that people don’t always follow doctors’ orders – particularly when it comes to chronic conditions. </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6645a2.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One 2017 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the CDC notes that one in five prescriptions written in the United States are never filled, and up to 50 percent of medicines were taken incorrectly (at the wrong time, wrong dose, etc). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving patient compliance, though, is a more complicated problem. The CDC report outlined a few solutions – some of which have more to do with the healthcare system than they do with health tech. Those include lowering economic barriers to medication, increasing team-based healthcare (your pharmacist and doctor coordinating prescription refills, for instance), and increasing access to healthcare in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report does highlight an avenue for health information technology to help address the non-compliance problem (it specifically mentions e-prescribing software). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech, like Sweetch, can only address the non-compliance problem in medicine if it doesn&#8217;t have a non-compliance problem of its own. To that end, Bahagon says the app has a record of user retention. “Even after 24 months, we still see around 45% of the patients that started using the system continue to use it,” he says.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User retention is a good sign for any app developer. But in the health space, it’s more complicated. Some studies </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27920321/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that consumer ratings are poor markers of how well these apps work to improve outcomes (you might like an app and use it, but it doesn’t make you any healthier). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that regard, Sweetch does</span><a href="https://www.jmir.org/2018/2/e72/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have a trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under its belt, conducted at two sites in the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app was tested on 55 adults with prediabetes over the course of three months. Forty-seven of the participants finished the trial, and on average, they increased their physical activity by an average of 2.8 MET-hours (they may have actually exercised for shorter periods, but their intensity was the equivalent of 2.8 hours of work), and lost about 1.6 kilograms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users also lowered their A1c levels, a key measure of average blood sugar. Prediabetic adults usually have an A1c </span><a href="https://www.diabetes.org/a1c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">between</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 5.7 and 6.5 percent, and those in this trial reduced their A1c levels by about .1 percent (the study refers to that reduction as “clinically meaningful.”) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study didn’t specifically compare Sweetch to any other prediabetes interventions. However, a study on that is upcoming. In </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUwMGFb8vUg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a December 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interview, Bahagon noted that Sweetch had received a grant from the National Institutes of Health to continue testing Sweetch against other “gold standard” interventions for diabetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevo and Bahagon didn’t provide concrete updates on the project, but noted that “in a month or so” the company may announce updates on the NIH funding and upcoming randomized controlled trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the company plans to use the Series A funding to expand into markets in the US and Brazil, grow the user base, and enhance the platform to provide specific and tailored recommendations for even more conditions. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft has secured a court order to take down several malicious “homoglyph” domains that were used to impersonate Office 365 customers and commit fraud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The technology giant <a href="https://noticeofpleadings.com/maliciousdomains/">filed a case</a> earlier this month after it uncovered cybercriminal activity targeting its customers. After receiving a customer complaint about a business email compromise attack, a Microsoft investigation found that the unnamed criminal group responsible created 17 additional malicious domains, which were then used together with stolen customer credentials to unlawfully access and monitor Office 365 accounts in an attempt to defraud the customers&#8217; contacts.</p>
<p>Microsoft confirmed in <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/07/19/cybercrime-homoglyphs-dcu-court-order/">a blog post published Monday</a> that a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia issued a court order requiring domain registrars to disable service on the malicious domains, which include “thegiaint.com” and “nationalsafetyconsuiting.com,&#8221; which were used to impersonate its customers.</p>
<p>These so-called “homoglyph” domains exploit the similarities of some letters to create deceptive domains that appear legitimate. For example, using an uppercase “I” and a lowercase “l” (e.g. MICROSOFT.COM vs. MlCROSOFT.COM).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“These were together with stolen customer credentials to unlawfully access customer accounts, monitor customer email traffic, gather intelligence on pending financial transactions, and criminally impersonate [Office 365] customers, all in an attempt to deceive their victims into transferring funds to the cybercriminals,” Microsoft said in its complaint, adding that the cybercriminals “have caused and continue to cause irreparable injury to Microsoft, its customers, and the public.”</p>
<p>In one instance, for example, the criminals identified a legitimate email from the compromised account of an Office 365 customer referencing payment issues. Capitalizing on this information, the criminals sent an email from a homoglyph domain using the same sender name and nearly identical domain. They also used the same subject line and format of an email from the earlier, legitimate conversation, but falsely claimed a hold had been placed on the account by the chief financial officer and that payment needed to be received as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The cybercriminals then attempted to solicit a fraudulent wire transfer by sending new wire transfer information appearing to be legitimate, including using the logo of the company they were impersonating.</p>
<p>Microsoft notes that while these criminals will typically move their malicious infrastructure outside the Microsoft ecosystem once detected, the order — granted on Friday — eliminates defendants’ ability to move these domains to other providers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The action will further allow us to diminish the criminals’ capabilities and, more importantly, obtain additional evidence to undertake further disruptions inside and outside court,” said Amy Hogan-Burney, general manager of Microsoft’s Digital Crime Unit.</p>
<p>The tech giant hasn’t yet disclosed the identities of the cybercriminals responsible for the BEC attacks, but said that “based on the techniques deployed, the criminals appear to be financially motivated, and we believe they are part of an extensive network that appears to be based out of West Africa.” The targets of the operation were predominantly small businesses operating in North America across several industries, according to Microsoft.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Microsoft secured a court order to step up its fight against cybercriminals and similar attacks, which research shows affected 71% of businesses in 2021. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/microsoft-domains-covid-19-attacks/">a court granted the tech giant&#8217;s request to seize and take control of malicious web domains</a> used in a large-scale cyberattack targeting victims in 62 countries with spoofed COVID-19 emails.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you spent any time this year desperately trying to figure out what the heck NFTs are, you probably have Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou to thank for that.</p>
<p>His startup&#8217;s crypto trading card marketplace NBA Top Shot went viral earlier this year with users dropping hundreds of millions of dollars on digital NBA collectibles. At the end of last year, the Top Shot platform was averaging around $20K-30K in digital collectibles sales volume per day. By late February, the platform hit an all-time-high, moving more than $45 million in trading volume, according to analytics site <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/nba-top-shot/sales/summary">Cryptoslam</a>, as a wave of crypto newbies descended on the platform.</p>
<p>Within months, Gharegozlou&#8217;s company went from a niche crypto gaming startup largely known to industry insiders to locking in a hulking <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-startup-dapper-labs-raising-money-at-over-7-5-billion-valuation?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=11543929116_112520154917&amp;utm_content=477036477316&amp;utm_term=dsa-19959388920&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwt8uGBhBAEiwAayu_9ZEFl0gcMnTGBqg_eKHTKkYSNwNoBx1AJA_1tf0hBlqrLIxPSjmrAhoC-I4QAvD_BwE">reported</a> $7.5 billion valuation as venture capitalists chased the opportunity to get a piece of it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Top Shot&#8217;s sudden popularity triggered a massive moment for NFTs, with billions of dollars moving through an asset class that few had heard of months prior. We&#8217;re thrilled to have Gharegozlou joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=dapperlabspost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=dapperlabspost&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disrupt this September 21-23</a>, to discuss the future of NFTs, crypto gaming and the decentralized internet.</p>
<p>NBA Top Shot was an industry anomaly, but it wasn&#8217;t even Dapper&#8217;s first industry-shaking hit. In 2017, CryptoKitties &#8212; another trading game where users could swap digital cats &#8212; caught on among early adopters and brought the nascent Ethereum network to a crawl, inspiring the developers of the popular blockchain to make a number of key changes over time. Gharegozlou has his own vision for the future of the crypto web; Dapper&#8217;s big bet of late is on the proprietary Flow blockchain that underpins Top Shot. The company is gunning to bring more gaming platforms onboard to take advantage of the faster, more energy-efficient blockchain network, and investors are betting hundreds of millions of dollars on their ability to capture the market.</p>
<p>With the larger NFT market&#8217;s sales volume sliding significantly in recent months, can it make a comeback? Will developers move away from the popular Ethereum blockchain to embrace Dapper&#8217;s more centralized network? Could NFTs reshape the entire online economy? We&#8217;re excited to dig into some of these questions with Gharegozlou onstage at Disrupt &#8212; it&#8217;s a session you won&#8217;t want to miss.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Zoom is betting a little less than a sixth of its value on a single wager.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoom, a well-known video conferencing company, will buy Five9, a company that sells software allowing users to reach customers across platforms and record notes on their interactions. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/18/zoom-buys-cloud-call-center-firm-five9-for-14-7-billion/">TechCrunch noted this morning</a>, the deal is merely &#8220;Zoom’s latest attempt to expand its offerings,&#8221; having &#8220;added several office collaboration products, a cloud phone system, and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/zoom-introduces-all-in-one-home-communications-appliance-for-599/">all-in-one home communications appliance</a>&#8221; to its larger software stack in recent quarters. Both companies are publicly traded.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Why would Zoom buy slower growth for so very much money? One thing to consider is that Five9&#8217;s most recent quarterly growth rate is quicker than the growth rate that it posted over the last 12 months.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But the Five9 deal is in a different league than its previous purchases. Indeed, the $14.7 billion transaction represents a material percentage of Zoom&#8217;s own value. That tells us that the company is not simply making a purchase in Five9, but is instead making a large bet that the combination of its business and that of the smaller company will prove rather accretive.</p>
<p>Zoom is worth $101.8 billion as of the time of writing, with the company&#8217;s shares slipping just over 4% today; the stock market is largely off this morning, making Zoom&#8217;s share price movements less indicative of investor reaction to the deal that we might think. Still, it doesn&#8217;t appear that the street is excessively thrilled by news of Zoom&#8217;s purchase.</p>
<p>That perspective may be reasonable, given that the Five9 transaction is worth nearly 15% of Zoom&#8217;s total market cap; the company is betting a little less than a sixth of its value on a single wager.</p>
<p>Not that Five9 doesn&#8217;t bring a lot to the table. In its <a href="https://investors.five9.com/static-files/6f34be7e-1df8-46ff-a397-274ca8fd9404">most recent quarter</a>, Five9 posted $138 million in total revenue, growth of 45% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p>Still, as Zoom reported in <a href="https://investors.five9.com/static-files/5528ff91-9e6f-44a6-96ba-ad58c52eea55">an investor deck</a> concerning the transaction, the smaller company&#8217;s growth rate pales compared to its own:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179080" style="width: 934px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179080" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2179080 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-19-at-10.05.08-AM.png" alt="" width="924" height="458" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-19-at-10.05.08-AM.png 924w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-19-at-10.05.08-AM.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-19-at-10.05.08-AM.png?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-19-at-10.05.08-AM.png?resize=768,381 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-19-at-10.05.08-AM.png?resize=680,337 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-19-at-10.05.08-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 924px) 100vw, 924px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179080" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zoom investor deck</p></div></p>
<p>This is where the deal gets interesting. Note that Five9&#8217;s revenue growth rate is a fraction of Zoom&#8217;s. The larger company, then, is buying a piece of revenue that is growing <em>slower</em> than its core business. That&#8217;s a bit of a flip from many transactions that we see, in which the smaller company being acquired is growing<em> faster </em>than the acquiring entity&#8217;s own operations.</p>
<p>Why would Zoom buy slower growth for so very much money? One thing to consider is that Five9&#8217;s most recent quarterly growth rate is quicker than the growth rate that it posted over the last 12 months. That implies that Five9 has room to accelerate growth compared to its historical pace, bringing its total pace of top-line expansion closer to what Zoom itself manages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s not much that thrills us more than a startup competition — and we mean deep down in our bones thrilled. That’s why we’re beyond excited to host the <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extreme-tech-challenge-global-finals-presented-by-techcrunch?ref=e2b251a54ff1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extreme Tech Challenge (XTC) Global Finals</a> on July 22 starting at 9:00 am (PT).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.rappi.com/">Rappi</a>, a Colombian on-demand delivery startup, has raised “over” $500 million at a $5.25 billion valuation in a Series F round led by T. Rowe Price, the company announced late Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baillie Gifford, Third Point, Octahedron, GIC and SoftBank also participated in the new funding event. Previous backers include DST Global, Y Combinator, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new financing brings Bogota-based Rappi’s total raised since its 2015 inception to over $2 billion, according to </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rappi/company_financials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, the country has operations in 9 countries and more than 250 cities across Latin America. Its last raise was a $300 million funding round in September of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Latin American Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (LAVCA), Rappi focused on delivering beverages and first, and has since expanded into meals, groceries, tech goods and medicine. The company also offers a cash withdrawal feature, allowing users to pay with credit cards and then receive cash from one of Rappi’s delivery agents. Today, the company says its app allows consumers to “order nearly any good or service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to traditional delivery, it says “users can get products delivered in less than 10 minutes, can access financial services, as well as &#8216;whims,” and “favors.&#8217; Whims allow users to order anything available in their coverage area. Favors offer an array of custom services, such as running an errand, going to the hardware store or picking out and delivering a gift. The two products allow users to connect directly with a courier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simón Borrero, Sebastian Mejia, and Felipe Villamarin launched the company in 2015, graduating from Y Combinator the following year. A16z’s initial investment in July 2016 was the Silicon Valley firm’s first investment in Latin America, according to LAVCA.</span></p>
<p>In January 2020, Rappi was reported to have <a href="https://www.axios.com/layoffs-rappi-softbank-food-delivery-04a38f1e-d7fd-482c-882a-3c834a28210e.html">laid off around 6% of its staff</a>, or about 300 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youth sports are an integral part of our communities, bringing families together and helping kids all over gain confidence and skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us don’t think about all the work that goes into setting up, growing and maintaining these leagues. It’s a lot. Today, </span><a href="http://leagueapps.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LeagueApps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to be the operating system for youth sports organizations, announced it has raised $15 million in a Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investor Contour Venture Partners led the financing, which brings to $35 million the company’s total funding since its 2010 inception. Major League Baseball and Elysian Park Ventures, the private investment arm of the ownership group of the Los Angeles Dodgers, also participated in the round. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slew of new and existing backers also put money in the round, including Olympic gold medalists Julie Foudy and Swin Cash; NFL veteran Derrick Dockery; Peter J. Holt, chairman of Spurs Sports &amp; Entertainment; Laura Dixon, founder and president of PRO Sports Assembly; and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investment management firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hamilton Lane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York-based company is working to help youth sports organizations, well, be better organized. It has developed registration and management software so that leaders of these sports organizations can better manage the process of running the leagues, communicate more effectively and collect payment more efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve built all the tools they need to power their programs,” said Brian Litvack, LeagueApps CEO and co-founder. Those tools include giving these leaders the means to do things like build a website, accept registrations, send messages to coaches and parents and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help them share information with governing bodies or associations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Local sports organizers have an important role in the community to make sure that sports happens,” Litvack said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179118" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179118" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2179118 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LeagueApps.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LeagueApps.jpg 1577w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LeagueApps.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LeagueApps.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LeagueApps.jpg?resize=768,515 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LeagueApps.jpg?resize=680,456 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LeagueApps.jpg?resize=1536,1030 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LeagueApps.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LeagueApps</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than charging for its software, it charges a small fee upfront and then takes a percentage of any transactions that are conducted via its platform. So if its users don’t get paid, it doesn’t get paid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means the company, like many others, took a bit of a hit when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020. But it’s since rebounded, and then some.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spring of 2021, the platform crossed the $2 billion in transactions-processed mark, doubling the $1 billion mark it reached in the summer of 2019. From 2016 to 2019, LeagueApps saw <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/fast500-winners.html">275% revenue growth</a>. Today, more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3,000 sports organizations use LeagueApps as their operating system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company projects that it will process more than 4 million sports registrations in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its flagship software, the company’s NextUp platform is designed to provide organizers with opportunities for leadership development and networking. It also runs </span><a href="https://blog.leagueapps.com/leagueapps-pledges-1-of-revenues-to-impact-500000-kids-by-end-of-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FundPlay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a philanthropic program focused on sports-based youth development programs in underserved communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a parent with children playing sports, Contour Ventures’ Matt Gorin said he was drawn to invest in LeagueApps. In his view, the company is tackling a “large yet fragmented” market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have seen firsthand just how important youth sports experiences, and the organizations that provide them, are to kids, families and communities,” he said.</span><b> “</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">LeagueApps is unique in so many ways, particularly regarding its unparalleled approach and commitment to combining technology, community, customer service and impact for the maturing youth sports market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LeagueApps plans to use its new capital mainly to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest in product and engineering so that it can “provide more solutions” to youth sports organizations.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before we jump into the deals, policy moves and micromobbin&#8217; news, I wanted to share the latest founders interview, a new series we launched this spring over at Extra Crunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s the opener to the interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jen Young and Jeff Cavins were sitting in a beige conference room at a downtown Vancouver hotel, wasting away under fluorescent lights, an endless PowerPoint and a pair of sad Styrofoam cups of coffee between them. Young was there on a marketing contract. Cavins was a board member. They shared one of those looks that only couples can understand. It said: There&#8217;s got to be something better than this.</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;something better than this&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/outdoorsy-co-founders/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">ended up becoming <strong>Outdoorsy</strong></a>, peer-to-peer RV and camper rental startup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="haQsKRPVC7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/outdoorsy-co-founders/">Outdoorsy co-founders detail how they expanded the sharing economy to RVs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Outdoorsy co-founders detail how they expanded the sharing economy to RVs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/outdoorsy-co-founders/embed/#?secret=haQsKRPVC7" data-secret="haQsKRPVC7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The interview with Cavins and Young covers why they started Outdoorsy, how they have evolved and improved their business model and what is coming next. Our series has a tiny twist: We will check in with these founders a year from the date that the interview was published.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>You know how those memes keep going around about why it makes total sense the Roaring 20s happened after the Spanish Flu a century ago? They bring up an important point. A very drunken, boisterous summer is already underway in places that are opening up (sorry, Melbourne), and these shenanigans are flying parallel to the rise of electric micromobility vehicles. The end result? People will — and already are — trying to ride these things drunk.</p>
<p><strong>Bird</strong> announced this week it is launching <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/birds-safe-start-discourages-intoxicated-riders-from-using-scooters-100015467.html">Safe Start</a>, a new in-app checkpoint designed to discourage people, but ultimately not stop them, from riding under the influence. It kicks off between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., when trouble is usually afoot, asking riders attempting to unlock a Bird if they can safely handle the vehicle by correctly entering a keyword into the app. The hope is that within the time it takes a would-be rider to stop swaying, close one eye, squint with the other and punch in those letters, they&#8217;ll have realized that they&#8217;re in no position to operate machinery and call a cab or hail a ride via an app instead.</p>
<p><strong>Lime</strong> has had a similar feature for the past couple of years, also activating after 10 p.m. in most markets. It asks riders to type in &#8220;Y-E-S&#8221; in response to the question, &#8220;Do you affirm you are not drunk and fit to ride?&#8221; I think it should be a simple, &#8220;Are you drunk?&#8221; but I have a thing against negative sentence structures.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from Lime told me the company is working on a more robust cognitive test as well as something else he can&#8217;t share yet, but if I were a betting woman, I&#8217;d say it has something to do with sensing whether someone is driving in a straight line or wobbling, an idea the company talked to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411127/lime-brad-bao-electric-scooter-drunk-detection-vergecast">The Verge</a> about two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Spin</strong> also has a similar feature it&#8217;s working on that hasn&#8217;t yet been launched. However, it&#8217;s a bit more involved than what Bird and Lime have launched.</p>
<p>Spin will soon feature a quiz that will test reaction times of the rider. The logic follows that people with higher blood alcohol content have slower reaction times. A Spin spokesperson told me the company would work with the city to determine which hours are of most concern and only implement the test during those hours. Slowpokes will have to source another means of transport home, probably with a stop off at the pizza place.</p>
<h3>Other cool stuff you can do with an e-scooter</h3>
<p><strong>Fenix</strong>, the shared e-scooter operator out of Abu Dhabi, is launching a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/abu-dhabi-based-micromobility-operator-fenix-launches-10-minute-grocery-delivery-service/">10-minute fresh grocery delivery service</a> on Reem Island, some boujie, high-tech, super dense mixed-use development off the city&#8217;s coast. The company figures it&#8217;s already paying for the vehicles themselves, the space to charge batteries and the employees to swap batteries and service the scooters, why not put those to use with another business line?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Abu Dhabi-based micromobility operator Fenix launches 10-minute grocery delivery service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/abu-dhabi-based-micromobility-operator-fenix-launches-10-minute-grocery-delivery-service/embed/#?secret=FPI4j3AbrK" data-secret="FPI4j3AbrK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It might be a logistical stroke of genius, especially if the software managing the fleets, deliveries and rides are integrated well. The company will have an undisclosed number of &#8220;dark stores&#8221; or private convenience stores (which will also house the batteries for charging) around the island so that those fresh avocados or packs of diapers are never too far from a millionaire&#8217;s penthouse. Fenix&#8217;s full-time employees will be stationed within the dark stores, accepting orders and putting together the delivery in two minutes before relaying it to a, no doubt, anxious co-worker who will have eight minutes to drop off the goods.</p>
<p>I have my doubts about that 10-minute success rate, many of which reside in my concern for the workers, but we&#8217;ll see how it goes, I guess. It&#8217;s a cool business model.</p>
<h3>What else is new?</h3>
<p>Irish micromobility company <strong>Zipp Mobility</strong> is making its first expansion off the island, <a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/start-ups/zipp-mobility-e-scooters-poland">launching its e-scooter operations</a> in Katowice, Poland. It&#8217;s a small city in the southern part of the country, but Zipp appears to be putting a stake hold in the region, with plans to launch in the surrounding cities of Sosnowiec and Dabrowa Gornicza by the end of August.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Veo</strong> is on its own expansion plans. The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/micromobility-operator-veo-raises-16m-to-fund-u-s-expansion/">$16 million in a Series A</a>, which it&#8217;ll use to fund the expansion of its fleet to new cities like Santa Monica, San Diego and New York, while also focusing on developing new form factors for untapped use cases.</p>

<p>Speaking of New York, <strong>Revel</strong> has announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/revel-turns-to-software-to-keep-its-e-moped-fleet-powered-without-straining-nycs-grid/">partnership with GridRewards</a>, an app that develops &#8220;virtual power plant&#8221; software. Essentially, Revel wants to save money while also not messing up NYC&#8217;s power grid, so it&#8217;s going to try its best to only charge its e-moped fleet when peak demand is low, and less expensive.</p>
<p>Revel is also doing a thing with FlixBus, an intercity bus operator. If you book with one, you get discounts with the others. FlixBus passengers travelling between DC and New York City will be eligible for a $5 one-time credit when booking electric mopeds in Revel&#8217;s app.</p>
<p>Finally, Santa Cruz-based electric bike startup <strong>Blix</strong> has <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/13/blix-unveils-updates-across-its-electric-bikes-with-cargo-folding-cruiser-and-city-e-bikes/">some new updates</a> to their rides that provide better performance, increased power and range, better brakes, fatter tires and a range of new colors.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>The big AV and deal news of the week is <strong>Aurora Innovation&#8217;s</strong> move to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/spacs-keep-rolling-as-autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-targets-blank-check-debut-with-13b-valuation/">become a publicly traded company</a> through a merger with <strong>Reinvent Technology Partners Y</strong>, the special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson.</p>
<p>The announcement confirmed my reporting in June that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">companies were close to finalizing a deal</a>.</p>
<p>Once the transaction closes, the combined company will be listed on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol AUR and have an implied valuation of $13 billion. Aurora was last valued at $10 billion following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/uber-in-talks-to-sell-atg-self-driving-unit-to-aurora/">acquisition of Uber&#8217;s self-driving unit</a>.</p>

<p>Through the deal, Aurora is capturing $1 billion from private investors, including Baillie Gifford, funds and accounts managed by Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., PRIMECAP Management Company, Reinvent Capital, XN, Fidelity Management and Research LLC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Index Ventures and Sequoia Capital, as well as strategic investments from Uber, PACCAR and Volvo Group.</p>
<p>One other note; Aurora also laid out some financial and deployment projections. Aurora plans to begin to generate revenue from trucks without vehicle operators in late 2023 and from cars without vehicle operators in late 2024, according to regulatory filings. Aurora expects to own and operate the trucks Aurora deploys through 2024, and cars that Aurora deploys through 2025 and will transition to a &#8220;Driver as a Service&#8221; (I guess, DaaS is going to be a thing?) business model.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bookaway</strong>, the travel tech startup, raised $46 million in funding from investors Aleph, Corner Ventures and Entrée Capital.</p>
<p><strong>Carmera</strong>, an HD mapping startup based in New York, has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/toyotas-woven-planet-acquires-hd-mapping-startup-carmera/">acquired by Woven Planet Holdings</a>. The announcement comes less than two months since Woven Planet Holdings — an entity created by Toyota to invest in, develop and eventually bring future of transportation technologies like automated driving to market — acquired Lyft&#8217;s autonomous vehicle unit known as Level 5 for $550 million. The financial terms were not disclosed.</p>

<p>Under terms of the deal, Carmera will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Woven Planet. Carmera will essentially become the U.S. outpost of Woven Planet&#8217;s automated mapping platform (AMP) team, which is headquartered in Tokyo. Ro Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Carmera, will report to Mandali Khalesi, who heads up AMP.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s 50-person team will maintain its offices in New York and Seattle and will eventually be integrated into Woven Planet&#8217;s 1,000-person-and-growing enterprise, according to Woven Planet CEO James Kuffner.</p>
<p><strong>Colis Privé</strong>, the French parcel delivery company, has postponed its initial public offering initially planned for early July, citing unfavorable market conditions, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-french-delivery-company-colis-priv-postpones-public-listing-2021-07-12/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Policy Corner! It&#8217;s finally here: The European Commission released its ambitious plan to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and as everyone expected, a proposed ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine cars by 2035 is included.</p>
<p>I mentioned in last week&#8217;s Policy Corner that I was curious if it would include any mandates for EV chargers or other infrastructure to support transportation electrification, and I was pleased to see that it does. While not quite a mandate, the proposal says it wants EU countries to install public charging stations every 60 kilometers (37.3 miles) on major roads by 2025, and every 150 kilometers (93.2 miles) for hydrogen refueling stations. The ultimate goal is to build 3.5 million new EV charging stations by 2030 and 16.3 million by 2050. Measures like these will hopefully help dissipate range anxiety, a common reason people cite for not choosing an EV today.</p>
<p>But hold onto your hats: The proposal still needs to be approved by all 27-member states before it can take effect. And France &#8212; where automaking is a cornerstone of the economy, thanks to OEMs like Stellantis and Renault &#8212; is reportedly pushing back against the terms. It could mean a longer battle over the specific deadlines and emissions reductions targets.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting question, whether a technology ban is the best path forward to achieve some end goal (in this case, lowering carbon emissions). That seems like the stick. I&#8217;ll be looking out for the honey &#8212; how legislators are going to sweeten the deal for consumers and automakers alike, so there can be as few jobs lost as possible and as many new EVs purchased.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I read an interesting post from Christian Brand, associate professor in the Transport Studies Unit at Oxford University, who argues that the focus on EVs is slowly down the path to zero emissions. He points out that as many as 50% of car trips are less than five kms (3.11 miles), so he suggests cities should invest in making areas more micromobility friendly to encourage more people to take up these forms of transport. Food for thought.</p>
<p>Speaking of carbon emissions, there&#8217;s a new partnership between eVTOL developer Joby Aviation, aircraft carrier JetBlue Airways and Signature Flight Support to help develop a new system for carbon credits in the aviation industry. Right now, there&#8217;s no current pathway for companies like JetBlue to purchase carbon credits from green aviation companies, probably because they&#8217;re just so new.</p>
<p>The three companies will &#8220;define the framework for the creation, validation and eventual use of these new credits on aviation carbon markets, including identifying a third party to oversee and validate transactions,&#8221; a news release said. The companies anticipate releasing more details later this year.</p>
<p>This could be a very profitable development for Joby. Tesla, for example, made $518 million in revenue from the first quarter of 2021 alone from selling regulatory credits to other automakers.</p>

<h2>Notable news and other tidbits</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s get right to it. Here&#8217;s what else happened this week.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Audi, BMW, Denso</strong> and chipmaker <strong>NXP</strong> have partnered on an international working group aimed at defining a safe automated driving system architecture for self-driving vehicles. The inaugural group, which was actually created last month but that I&#8217;m just sharing with you now, is being spearheaded by The Autonomous. Companies from the industry are invited to learn more about this cross-industry collaboration at The Autonomous Main Event on September 29, 2021.</p>

<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Electrify America</strong>, the entity set up by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel emissions cheating scandal said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/electrify-america-to-double-number-of-ev-chargers-as-wave-of-electric-vehicles-come-to-market/">double the number</a> of its electric vehicle fast charging stations in the United States and Canada by the end of 2025. The commitment, if successful, means 1,800 fast charging stations &#8212; or 10,000 individual chargers &#8212; will be installed and operational by that time.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> and its new EV business unit BrightDrop are launching a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/gm-to-launch-fleet-charging-service-to-power-commercial-evs-even-at-home/"> fleet-charging service</a> as the automaker aims to ramp up its bet on connected and electric commercial vehicles. The service, branded Ultium Charge 360 fleet charging service offers many of the tools that a commercial delivery, sales or motor pool business might need. It also includes an effort to add home charging for drivers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite being one of the earliest adopters of using the world wide web to disrupt how its business is done and connect with more potential customers, the recruitment industry ironically remains one of the more fragmented and behind the times when it comes to using new, cloud-based services to work more efficiently. A new startup is hoping to change that, and it&#8217;s picked up some funding on strong, early signs of traction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dover</a>, which has built what CEO and co-founder Max Kolysh describes as a &#8220;recruitment orchestration platform&#8221; &#8212; aimed at recruiters, it helps them juggle and aggregate multiple candidate pools to source suitable job candidates automatically, and then manage the process of outreach (including using tools to automatically re-write job descriptions, as well as to write recruitment and rejection letters) &#8212; has raised $20 million from an impressive list of investors.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the Series A round, with Founders Fund, Abstract Ventures and Y Combinator also investing. Dover was part of YC&#8217;s Summer 2019 class (which debuted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/here-are-the-82-startups-that-launched-on-day-2-of-ycs-s19-demo-days/">August 2020</a>), and Founders Fund led its seed round. Since leaving the incubator, it has picked up more than 100 customers, mostly from the world of tech, including ClearCo, Lattice, Samsara and others, even larger companies that you might have assumed would have their own in-house orchestration and automation platforms in place already.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Orchestration&#8221; in the world of business IT is commonly used for software built for the fields of sales and marketing: In both of these, there is a lot of fragmentation and work involved in sourcing good leads to become potential customers, and so tech companies have built platforms both to source interesting contacts and handle some of the initial steps needed to reach out to them, and get them engaged.</p>
<p>That, it turns out, is a very apt way to think of the recruitment industry, too, not least because it also, to a degree, involves a company &#8220;selling&#8221; itself to candidates to get them interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say recruiting is sales and marketing,&#8221; Kolysh said. &#8220;We&#8217;re comparable to sales ops, but sales is five-10 years ahead in terms of technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recruiters and hiring managers, especially those working in industries where talent is at a premium and therefore proactively hiring good people can be a challenge, are faced with a lot of busy work to find interesting candidates and engage them to consider open jobs, and subsequently handling the bigger process of screening, reaching out to them and potentially rejecting some while making offers to others.</p>
<p>This is mainly because the process of doing all of these is typically very fragmented: Not only are there different tools built to handle these different processes, but there is an almost endless list of sources today where people go to look for work, or get their names out there.</p>
<p>Dover&#8217;s approach is based on embracing that fragmentation and making it easier to handle. Using AI, it taps platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed and Triplebyte &#8212; a likely list, given its initial focus on tech &#8212; to source candidates that it believes are good fits for a particular opening at a company.</p>
<p>Dover does this with a mix of AI and understanding what a recruiter is looking for, plus any extra parameters if they have been set by the recruiter to carry this out (for example, diversity screening, if the employer would like to have a candidate pool that is in line with a company&#8217;s inclusion targets).</p>
<p>Dover also uses data science and AI to help calibrate a recruiter&#8217;s communications with would-be candidates, from the opening job description through to job offer or rejection letters. (Why dwell on rejection letters? Because these candidates are already in a short list, and so even if they didn&#8217;t get one particular job, they are likely good prospects for future roles.)</p>
<p>&#8220;No human wants to write 100 cold emails per week, but on the other hand, there are many people to hit up and connect with,&#8221; Kolysh said of the challenges that recruiters face. &#8220;When a company is seeing a lot of growth, it needs to scale fast. You just can&#8217;t do that without technology anymore.&#8221; Kolysh &#8212; who co-founded the company with Anvisha Pai (CTO) and George Carollo (COO) &#8212; said all three founders experienced that firsthand working at previous startups and trying to recruit while also building the other aspects of the business. (They are pictured above, along with founding engineer John Holliman.)</p>
<p>Given how much orchestration has caught on in the world of sales, there is a strong opportunity here for Dover to bring a similar approach to recruitment, based on what seems to be a very close understanding of the flawed recruitment process as it exists today. Whether that brings more competitors to the space &#8212; or more tools from some of the bigger players in, say, candidate sourcing &#8212; will be one factor to watch, as will how and if Dover manages to make the leap to other industries beyond tech.</p>

<p>But for now, its usefulness for a particular segment of the market is also what caught the eye of Tiger Global.</p>
<p>John Luttig, the partner who led the investment for Founders Fund, noted in an interview that most recruiting tools in the market today might best be described as point solutions, addressing scheduling or interviews, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the full stack here that is appealing,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;And it&#8217;s automated, which is particularly valuable for early and mid-stage tech companies, to keep candidates from falling through the cracks. It also saves time from having to build up big recruiting departments. And because Dover owns all that work, those working in recruitment can instead focus on culture building, or assessing the candidates.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The CEO joined us last week at a TechCrunch Early Stage event to share all kinds of insight, from the state of the market to his thoughts on why there's suddenly so much money flooding into VC.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few companies have deeper insights into the day-by-day state of venture capital than AngelList. According to the company&#8217;s data, over 51% of the &#8220;top tier U.S. VC deals&#8221; involve their platform and tools, giving them a remarkably expansive view of everything going on.</p>
<p>AngelList Venture CEO Avlok Kohli joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage to discuss topics ranging from the state of the market to his thoughts on why there&#8217;s suddenly so much money flooding into VC (sending valuations to the sky), and where AngelList could go from here. We started with a presentation wrapping together everything Kohli is seeing in the industry right now, followed up by a largely audience-driven Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve embedded the full interview at the bottom of this post, but here are some highlights:</p>
<h3>AngelList&#8217;s growing focus on founders</h3>
<p>Kohli says he never expected to end up in the venture industry, but the potential for AngelList to grow into something entirely new drew him in:</p>
<blockquote><p>I definitely did not think of venture as the industry I would be in. What actually attracted me to it wasn&#8217;t necessarily venture, it was actually the makings of a financial platform and being able to build tools and products that eventually extend to founders. When I stepped in, a lot of our tools were built for GPs and LPs — really the funder side — and how you&#8217;d reduce the friction and get more people coming into venture. Really leaning into the solo capitalist movement, and having more LPs coming in.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s also this opportunity to start building founder products, which obviously is near and dear to my heart. I do think there are a lot of things we can do to improve not just the fundraising experience, but also the downstream products that they can use. All the way from banking, to spend management, to cap tables, the whole nine yards. I think there&#8217;s so much we can do there. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 10:11)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>When I later asked him to elaborate on what those founder-focused products might look like, Kohli expanded:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Robinhood's huge valuation indicates that its ascent in the last 18 months from breakout unicorn to category-defining upstart is about to be embraced by the public market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robinhood released <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm">an S-1/A filing</a> detailing its first IPO price range this morning. The company first filed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">go public in early July</a> after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">raising billions earlier in the year</a>.</p>
<p>The well-known U.S. consumer fintech giant intends to sell shares in its public market debut at a price between $38 and $42 per share. Robinhood is selling 52,375,000 in its IPO, worth $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion. Another 2,625,000 are being offered by existing shareholders, while its underwriting banks have the option to purchase a further 5,500,000 shares in the transaction.</p>
<p>All told, Robinhood could see shares trade hands worth just over $2.5 billion in its IPO at the top end of its initial price range.</p>

<hr />
<p>We want to know Robinhood&#8217;s simple and diluted IPO valuation ranges, and we want to dig into the company&#8217;s newly released preliminary Q2 2021 results. Then we&#8217;ll do some fun math to better understand just how rich, or not, Robinhood&#8217;s current price range seems to be. From there, we&#8217;ll discuss whether we expect to see Robinhood raise its price range before it debuts.</p>
<p>Sound good? Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Robinhood worth?</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll start by calculating a few valuation marks for Robinhood to help put its $38 to $42 per-share IPO price range into context.</p>
<p>First, Robinhood&#8217;s post-IPO <em>simple</em> share count is expected to be 835,675,280, not including shares reserved for possible underwriter purchase. That share count values Robinhood at $31.8 billion at $38 per share and $35.1 billion at $42 per share. Those figures rise by $209 million and $231 million, respectively, if we count the 5.5 million shares that its banks may purchase as part of the IPO.</p>
<p>But what folks will want to chat on Twitter about is the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation. At the midpoint of its price range, Robinhood is worth more than $38 billion when shares tied up in vested <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp">RSUs</a> and options are counted. That figure lands around $40 billion at the top end of Robinhood&#8217;s price range.</p>
<p>Robinhood would therefore be worth $35 billion, calculated using a simple share count, or as much as $40 billion if more equity is counted. Both numbers are fucking huge and indicate that Robinhood&#8217;s ascent in the last 18 months from breakout unicorn to category-defining upstart is about to be embraced by the public market, provided that it prices at least in range.</p>
<p>How do those prices feel, given our read of today&#8217;s market dynamics?</p>
<h2>How is Robinhood doing?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Music app <a href="https://www.musicbreakr.com/">Breakr</a> this week announced a $4.2 million seed round, led by Slow Ventures. The latest raise follows $700,000 in funding led by Andreessen Horowitz’s TxO fund &#8211;a round the people behind the service considered a sort of proof of concept as they worked to get the idea off the ground.</p>
<p>It’s clear why Breakr’s offering is an appealing one for investors. The product serves as a way to connect up and coming musicians with social media influencers. Musicians get exposure and the influencers get paid to effectively host an office hours listening session. Breakr, meanwhile, gets a 10% cut from the revenue.</p>

<p>It’s a unique approach in an overcrowded music marketplace, where discovering music and being discovered have both proven difficult codes to crack. Though it&#8217;s less about tweaking the algorithm for music listeners than it is getting undiscovered music in front of the right set of ears. Speaking with two of the startup’s six founders, we reminisced about the days rappers stood outside of record stores, attempting to sell mixtape CD-Rs for $5 a pop &#8212; things have come a long way since then, but no one has fully solved the problem of music discovery.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Breakr is a needed tool to efficiently connect artists, influencers and brands. I know from first hand experience that this process manually is too time consuming to not only find an array of diverse influencers but activate them as well,&#8221; AMP Technologies&#8217; Marc Byers said in a release. &#8220;They’ve created what I call a mall of influential marketers, where all you have to do is shop what talent fits the taste of your campaign needs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>And while the medium has changed to social media, the hustle and feelings of futility haven’t. Not everyone gets their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNyjpHo8t-E">Mobb Deep story</a> with Q-Tip stopping and listening to a few bars after coming out of the Def Jam offices. Obviously we need a lot more Q-Tips in the world, just as a general rule. With human cloning technology still lacking, however, Breakr is hoping to offer some approximation of the experience, with added financial incentive.</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re a world-renowned DJ or A&amp;R at a major label, these artists are already in your emails, and DMS, trying to get your attention,” says CEO Tony Brown, who previously worked for financial giant Goldman Sachs. “We give them a unique URL, they send that unique URL and say, ‘hey, stay out of my DMS, meet me here. Here&#8217;s the cost. And let&#8217;s talk about it.’ ”</p>

<p>Influencers charge artists on a sliding scale &#8212; likely commanding more based on their following. Breakr says around 12,000 users have signed up for influencer accounts, which the company is currently in the process of vetting. Between 3,000-4,000 accounts have been approved.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve worked with companies as big as Warner and Sony, as small as the SoundCloud rapper, and everybody in between,” adds inventor and head of Product Ameer Brown, who was formerly with Adobe.</p>
<p>Rapper, influencer and long-time friend Tobe Nwigwe is also on the long list of co-founders and has been active in helping spread the brand through social media, including hosting his own listening sessions.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I saw the vision for what the Breakr team was building, essentially the tech-middle-man between influencers and artists, I immediately knew Breakr would be the future,” says Nwigwe. “Having cultural icons like Erykah Badu and Dave Chapelle rock with my music, and organically amplify me on their platforms, was major for me. Now, with Breakr, we make this happen authentically for artists and influencers of all levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the subject of cultural icons, Nas is also among the notable investors. “We loved the company before we knew the connection but that coincidence really made doing this deal even more special,” the rapper said in a comment provided to TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.recapped.io/">Recapped</a>, a startup building collaborative sales software, announced the close of a $6.3 million seed round today. The deal was led by Charles River Ventures. Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator, CoFound, AirAngels, Prime Set, Twenty5Twenty, Peter Kazanjy, Alan Chunk and other angels also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Recapped was founded by Mark Fershteyn and Ujwal Battar. Fershteyn spent his career in sales, first as an account executive at Citrix and then as vice president of sales at App Academy. He felt firsthand the difficulty of collaboration in the sales space, not only with members of the sales team and other departments within an organization, but also with the buy side of a transaction. That cross-team, cross-company clunkiness leads to challenges around transparency and business planning.</p>
<p>Recapped aims to solve the issue. Its software allows users within an organization to collaborate around a deal. For example, the customer experience (CX) and post-sales team can keep abreast of a deal as it&#8217;s coming together, as can the CEO or CFO. That may help those teams and individuals better project future workloads, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But perhaps most uniquely, buyers are given an almost identical UX as the sales team, allowing both parties to have a collaborative check-list of action items, deliverables and data to work off of to make sure they cross the finish line.</p>
<p>Salespeople can create a super customizable and interactive landing page with Recapped that they can send to a potential client. That page may include customer testimonials, product videos and other information to help the client get acquainted with the product. It also includes a check list for the sales process, from delivering a proof of concept to running a pilot to getting sign-off from the necessary parties and more.</p>
<p>Though sales-side teams must have a seat to use the software, the buyer side simply receives a link and starts working.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179068" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179068" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2179068" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="557" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg 2378w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=300,246 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=768,629 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=680,557 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=1536,1258 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=2048,1678 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/recapped_preview_updated.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179068" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Recapped</p></div></p>
<p>Recapped is meant to replace what&#8217;s known in the industry as a Mutual Action Plan or a Success Plan, typically built and managed with a blend of spreadsheets and email.</p>
<p>Moreover, leadership, finance and other departments within the selling company can look at the array of deals in progress to get a clearer picture of what will close and when, allowing for easier forecasts for investors and preparation among teams like CX and post-sale.</p>
<p>Recapped launched into beta in 2019, and publicly in the summer of 2020. Since then, it&#8217;s doubled revenue every quarter and expanded from two employees to 11. Nearly half of those employees are either women or underrepresented minorities.</p>
<p>According to Fershteyn, Recapped is helping its customers close deals 18% faster, close 23% more total deals and streamline customer onboarding times by up to 28%.</p>
<p>&#8220;What keeps me up at night is ensuring that the product is as easy to use as possible while still being incredibly customizable for our customers because everyone has a different sales process and onboarding process and each customer prefers something different,&#8221; Fershteyn said. &#8220;Making it incredibly easy to use while we scale and taking that into the next year and a half as we deploy this $6 million is the biggest challenge.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The New York-based commercial real estate startup is curating a marketplace of pre-approved vendors for tenants and property managers to find and hire the people they need in a compliant way. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Commercial real estate tenants and property managers have to abide by strict liability rules that any vendor entering the property must have insurance certificates and meet other requirements. The approval process for this currently can take days and is still largely done on paper.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://getjones.com/">Jones</a>. The New York-based commercial real estate startup is curating a marketplace of pre-approved vendors for tenants and property managers to find and hire the people they need in a compliant way.</p>
<p>To continue advancing its network, the company announced Monday it raised $12.5 million in Series A funding led by JLL Spark and Khosla Ventures that also included strategic investors Camber Creek, Rudin Management, DivcoWest and Sage Realty. This new investment brings Jones’ total raised to $20 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/get-jones/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jones, founded in 2017, also manages certifications and approvals, moving the whole process online. Its technology can process an insurance certificate in less than an hour and reduce the overall vendor approval time to 2.5 days — from 12 days — with 99.9% accuracy, co-founder and CEO Omri Stern told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The accuracy portion is key. With much of the work being done by hand, current accuracy is at about 30%, he added. In addition, the certifications are lengthy, and it is typically up to property managers to parse through the insurance documents to identify what is missing rather than spending time with tenants.</p>
<p>“In the consumer world, a homeowner expects to go on a marketplace and find a service and hire them,” Stern said. “Office managers and tenants can’t get their preferred vendors through the approval process, so we want to provide a similar digital experience that they can consume and use in real estate.”</p>
<p>He says Jones’ differentiator from competitors is that all of the stakeholders are in place: a group of high-profile real estate customers, including Lincoln Property Co., Prologis, DivcoWest, Rudin Management, Sage Realty and JLL.</p>
<p>Yishai Lerner, co-CEO of JLL Spark, agrees, telling TechCrunch that commercial real estate is one of the largest and last asset classes that is undergoing a technology transformation, similar to what fintech was 20 years ago.</p>
<p>He estimates the U.S. market to be $16 trillion, of which technology could unlock a lot of the value. That opportunity was one of the drivers for JLL to create JLL Spark, where Jones is one of the first investments.</p>
<p>Though Lerner spent time with property management teams on the ground, he became up close and personal with the problem when his wife, while moving offices, found out her vendors were not allowed in the building because they didn’t have the right insurance.</p>
<p>“We learned that property managers spend half of their time just working to verify the compliance of vendors coming into their building,” Lerner said. “We wondered why there wasn’t technology for this. Jones was doing construction at the time, and we brought them into commercial real estate because they had an example of how technology could solve the problem.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Series A comes at a time when Stern is seeing Jones’s SaaS tool take off in the past 10 months. He would not get specific with growth metrics, but did say that what is driving growth is “competing against the status quo” as companies are searching for and adapting workflow solutions.</p>
<p>The company intends to use the new funds on product development in both quicker and easier approvals and bringing on new vendors. Jones already works with tens of thousands of vendors. It will also focus on integration, offering an API that could be used in other industry verticals where compliance is necessary.</p>
<p>Stern would also like to continue building the team. Having brought in real estate experts, he is now also looking for people with backgrounds in fintech, cybersecurity and insurtech to bring in additional perspectives.</p>
<p>“We are building an incredible company with the opportunity to be the next big digital marketplace,” he added.</p>
