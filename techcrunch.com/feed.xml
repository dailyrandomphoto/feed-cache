										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.voodoo.io">Voodoo</a> has made a significant acquisition in the casual mobile gaming market. The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.bbumgames.com">Beach Bum</a>, a game studio based in Israel and specialized in tabletop and card games.</p>
<p>It’s hard to get a clear number for this acquisition as Voodoo is offering both cash and shares and there are some retention bonuses. According to a source, Voodoo could be paying a few hundred millions of dollars in total. Beach Bum has generated $70 million in revenue over the past 12 months, so that gives you an idea of the size of the deal.</p>
<p>Voodoo is better known for its <a href="https://www.voodoo.io/games">hyper-casual games</a>, such as Helix Jump, Crowd City, Hole.io or Paper.io 2. The company is both a game developer and publisher. It partners with other game studios and has built a tech stack to optimize distribution, average revenue per user and more.</p>
<p>The company has raised money <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/tencent-takes-minority-stake-in-french-casual-games-maker-voodoo/">from Tencent</a> and Goldman Sachs. More recently, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert invested €266 million ($309 million at today’s exchange rate) in Voodoo. It values the company at €1.7 billion (nearly $2 billion).</p>
<p>Voodoo didn’t waste any time and started looking at acquisition targets for external growth opportunities right after raising some fresh capital. Right now, there are 350 people working for Voodoo. Beach Bum has 150 employees who will join Voodoo.</p>
<p>With today’s acquisition, Voodoo is expanding to a new segment, adding a handful of casual games to its hyper-casual catalog. Beach Bum currently has three games in the App Store —&nbsp;Backgammon (Lord of the Board), Spades Royale and Gin Rummy Stars.</p>
<p>The business model is also a bit different. Historically, Voodoo has mostly relied on advertising to monetize its games. Beach Bum focuses on in-app purchases instead. This way, the acquisition diversifies Voodoo’s revenue sources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“[Beach Bum] has two more games in development right now. The intention of Voodoo is to use Beach Bum as their entrance into in-app purchases. So I think they’ll want Beach Bum to put out as many games as possible,” Gigi Levy-Weiss told me.</p>
<p>Gigi Levy-Weiss is a general partner at VC firm <a href="https://www.nfx.com">NFX</a> and co-founded Beach Bum back in 2015. He doesn’t currently have an operational role at the gaming company but he is active chairman of the board.</p>
<p>“The Israeli gaming industry has grown significantly in the recent few years. To date, it counts 400 different companies. Few exits have taken place, mainly by European and Asian buyers. A few months ago, an Israeli gaming company <a href="https://www.playtika.com">Playtika</a> IPOed at Nasdaq for the valuation of $11B,“ Avihai Michaeli, a senior investment banker based in Tel Aviv, told me.</p>

Financial terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed.

<p>“PlayStation has such an iconic gaming catalog and for us there’s been nothing better than to bring some of gaming’s masterpieces to new players,” said Marco Thrush, the president of Bluepoint Games. “Becoming a part of PlayStation Studios empowers our team to raise the quality-bar even further and create even more impactful experiences for the PlayStation community.”</p>
<p>With the announcement of today’s deal, Sony has acquired three studios in the past year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blockchain cybersecurity startup <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a> this morning announced a $23 million investment in <a href="https://forta.org/">Forta</a>, a security service aimed at smart contracts.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz led the round, which OpenZeppelin CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/demibrener">Demian Brener</a> described as 3x oversubscribed. The investment also attracted capital from Coinbase Ventures, True Ventures and Blockchain Capital, among others.</p>
<p>Per Brener, OpenZeppelin will retain a stake in Forta.</p>
<p>Forta is a neat project that comes at an interesting point for the larger blockchain community. When bitcoin came to market, it attracted interest as a potential medium of exchange, or perhaps a store of value. The latter use case wound up being the key bitcoin value offering. But while bitcoin was maturing, other blockchains were built that featured more native programmability, allowing developers around the world to leverage smart (self-executing) contracts for a host of use cases.</p>
<p>Ethereum is one of the best-known blockchains to feature smart contracts, which <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/">its foundation describes</a> simply as &#8220;program[s] that [run] on the Ethereum blockchain.&#8221; There&#8217;s more nuance to the matter, but that will suffice for our needs today. Forta, in turn, wants to help secure smart contracts across the blockchain market.</p>
<p>We summarized it as an attempt to build Web 3.0 security using Web 3.0 DNA when we were chatting with Brener, and he agreed. By that, we mean that Forta isn&#8217;t precisely the sort of company that TechCrunch tends to write about when it comes to venture capital fundraises; instead, Forta is nearly an attempt to empower a community of developers to build the tooling that they need to keep their own projects secure.</p>
<p>The heart of Forta, Brener explained, is a community of &#8220;agent writers,&#8221; or developers creating pieces of code that hunt up threats &#8212; on layer-one or -two chains, and sidechains &#8212; that fall into one of four main buckets of risk, namely cybersecurity, financial, operational or governance. The other half of the Forta project is nodes, or essentially what runs the agents themselves.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per OpenZeppelin, lots of the code used to write Forta agents will be repurposable, which could help code get written once and then deployed with variations to many chains. This is what Brener means when he thinks of Forta as helping developers in the larger blockchain world help themselves.</p>
<p>And the concept is not idle. Per a release from Forta, the team behind the project thinks that the &#8220;pace of innovation on public blockchains&#8221; is rapid enough that no &#8220;centralized solution can effectively address these evolving risks.&#8221; So, threats attacking the decentralized market will have to be solved, in Forta&#8217;s view, by even more decentralized activity.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was obviously curious how the Forta project would make money. Brener said that for the project to become a business, it will need to first help its community thrive. Part of that is opening its doors a little more today, allowing more developers than it did during its private beta to write agents.</p>
<p>Presuming that Forta can attract as many developers as it hopes, it will become a centralized source of smart contract security tooling. From that point, making money won&#8217;t be impossible, though it will be interesting to see precisely what business model Forta eventually chooses.</p>
<p>On the point of organizational centrality, Forta is today run by a set of folks. In time, the company could become a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, Brener said. If that bears out, the blockchain community will have managed to take external capital and internal knowledge, blended the two into a development community, and built not only security tooling for smart contracts, but managed to do so under the auspices of its own smart contract (DAO). So, this is at once a venture capital story and also a meta-moment for how far the crypto world has come in terms of taking care of itself.</p>
<p>I am sure that at some point in the above paragraphs I got something slightly wrong. Such is the risk of covering nascent efforts to build security tooling for the cutting-edges of the digital economy. But what matters more than any particular quibble is that the blockchain world is working to build the tools it needs to keep smart contracts safe; by doing so, using smart contracts should become less risky. And less risk means more market appetite.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something that a16z, with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/a16zs-new-2-2b-fund-wont-just-bet-on-the-crypto-future-it-will-defend-it/">huge crypto-focused bets</a>, and companies like Coinbase are more than in favor of. The dollars flowing toward Forta are a rounding error for its wealthy backers, even if its possible impact on their favorite market might be anything but.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In recent years, rows of electric scooters and bikes lining sidewalks have become a common sight in cities around the United States.</p>
<p>The size of the e-scooter market alone is expected <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-il/publications/2019/promise-pitfalls-e-scooter-sharing">to surpass</a> $40 billion by 2025, and Americans have taken more than <a href="https://nacto.org/shared-micromobility-2019/">342 million</a> trips on shared bikes and e-scooters since 2010.</p>
<p>Micromobility services generate a massive amount of mobility data, including potentially sensitive precise location data about users. Data from mobility services can provide valuable and timely insights to guide transportation and infrastructure policy, but the sharing of sensitive mobility data &#8212; between companies or between and with government agencies &#8212; can only be justified if issues of privacy and public trust are first addressed.</p>
<p>Innovative mobility options are providing cities with opportunities to solve the <a href="https://escooternerds.com/last-mile-transportation-electric-scooter/">last-mile transportation problem</a>, and the data from these services has a range of <a href="https://policydata.numo.global/">productive uses</a>.</p>
<p>It can help city planners design transportation improvements, such as protected bike lanes, to keep users safe. Access to mobility data gives community advocates and government officials the ability to know in nearly real time how many mobility devices are in a certain area so cities can enforce limits to ensure neighborhoods are not overcrowded or underserved. This data can also <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/">streamline communications</a> between companies and city governments, making it easier for mobility services to quickly adapt to events and emergencies in cities.</p>
<p>However, there are valid privacy concerns over the granularity and quantity of data that digitally enabled mobility services are able to collect and request to share with governments.</p>
<p>For example, a recent <a href="https://www.aclusocal.org/en/cases/sanchez-v-los-angeles-department-transportation">lawsuit</a> filed against the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and the City of Los Angeles alleges that the city’s collection of e-scooter trip data through the <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/">Mobility Data Specification</a> violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act. A lower court <a href="https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/2021/08/03/clinic-files-technologists-brief-in-ninth-circuit-scooter-privacy-case/">dismissed the lawsuit</a> and the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU of Northern and Southern California recently asked a federal appeals court to <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-aclu-urge-appeals-court-revive-challenge-los-angeles-collection-scooter-riders?s">revive it</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Additionally, a bill recently <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB859">introduced</a> in the California Legislature would require specific conditions to be met before mobility data is shared with public agencies or contractors. Under this bill, data could only be shared to assist transportation planning or protect the safety of users. The bill also requires that any trip data must be more than 24 hours old before being shared.</p>
<p>Near-real-time <a href="https://fpf.org/blog/a-closer-look-at-location-data-privacy-and-pandemics/">location data</a> is often required to fulfill valid safety and regulatory enforcement purposes, but this data is very sensitive because it could reveal intimate aspects of an individual’s life. Patterns in location data could indicate personal habits, interpersonal relationships or religious practices.</p>
<p>While it is possible in some cases to “de-identify” location data tied to a specific individual or device, it is incredibly difficult to truly make any data set of precise location history truly anonymous. Even highly aggregated location data about patterns of large groups of people can unintentionally reveal sensitive information.</p>
<p>In 2017, a “global heat map” of user movement in the Strava fitness app inadvertently <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/strava-heat-map-military-bases-fitness-trackers-privacy/">revealed the location</a> of deployed military personnel in classified locations. Location data, even when de-identified or aggregated, should be subject to checks and controls to ensure the data remains protected and private.</p>
<p>Local governments and mobility companies are taking these issues of user privacy seriously. Over the past few months, the<a href="https://fpf.org/"> Future of Privacy Forum</a> has worked with SAE’s <a href="https://mdc.sae-itc.com/">Mobility Data Collaborative</a> and public and private stakeholders to create a<a href="https://fpf.org/blog/fpf-and-mobility-data-collaborative-release-resources-to-help-organizations-assess-the-privacy-risks-of-sharing-of-mobility-data/"> transportation-tailored privacy assessment tool</a> that focuses on considerations for organizations that want to share mobility data in a privacy-sensitive manner.</p>
<p>The Mobility Data Sharing Assessment (MDSA) provides organizations in both the public and private sectors with operational guidance to conduct thoughtful, in-depth legal and privacy reviews of their data-sharing processes. Organizations that use this tool for sharing mobility data will be able to embed privacy and equity considerations into the design of mobility data-sharing agreements.</p>
<p>The goal of the MDSA is to enable responsible data sharing that protects individual privacy, respects community interests and equities, and encourages transparency to the public. By equipping organizations with an open-source, interoperable, customizable and voluntary framework that includes guidance, the barriers to sharing mobility data will be reduced.</p>
<p>This is the first version of the MDSA tool; it focuses specifically on ground-based mobility devices and location data. Some mobility vehicles like e-scooters now come equipped with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/19/e-scooter-pedestrian-detection-voi/">on-board cameras</a>, so in the future, the MDSA may be appended to add guidance about images and video collected by mobility devices.</p>
<p>The MDSA tool is open source and customizable, so organizations sharing this type of mobility data can edit it to consider the risks and benefits of sharing sensor or camera data that includes images.</p>
<p>Micromobility services can play a key role in improving access to jobs, food and health care. However, there are multiple factors for companies and government agencies to consider before sharing mobility data with other organizations, including the precision, immediacy and type of data shared. Organizations must assess these factors in a thoughtful, structured manner that considers any potential sources of bias.</p>
<p>That’s the key to using mobility data to maximize the benefits of services in the short term and build their infrastructure in the long term, allowing people to move about cities safer and faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">At last year&#8217;s inaugural <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633015242487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHor_VGE6KntM1F3I-krw4ZtxLP_g">Sight Tech Global </a>event, a virtual event dedicated to applications of AI and related tech to accessibility for people who are blind, one of the most popular sessions belonged to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saqibshaikh/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/saqibshaikh/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633015242487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtrz_VaQtePncD9TSRSG6Bq9B3PA">Saqib Shaikh</a>. The Microsoft engineer co-founded and leads the Seeing AI mobile app, which embeds a remarkable number of services beneficial to people who are blind, from reading documents and signs, to recognizing friends, grocery items, currency notes and even exploring photos by touch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re delighted that Shaikh will make a return appearance at this year&#8217;s Sight Tech Global. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633015242487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFYrWaYGskT0MQWNDjw1im9s8Cr-w">Register now</a> for the free, virtual event on December 1-2.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Shaikh describes his work as &#8220;a conversation between the blind community and the engineers/scientists at Microsoft &#8212; understanding the daily challenges our customers face and what emerging technologies could be leveraged to create novel solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the past year, Shaikh&#8217;s team has been adding features at a fast pace. Most recently they have created an audio augmented reality experience to assist with exploring an unfamiliar environment. It recognizes things in the world and places them in 3D space. When wearing headphones, items will be announced from their position in the room, such as the word &#8220;chair&#8221; coming from the chair itself. Users can place virtual audio beacons on objects to track the location of the door, for example, and use the haptic proximity sensor to feel the outline of the room.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All of this is made possible by combining the latest advances in AR, computer vision and the iPhone 12 Pro&#8217;s lidar sensor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At Sight Tech Global, Shaikh will discuss the Seeing AI team&#8217;s work to combine these remarkable technologies that promise to improve the independence of folks with vision loss, and describe the team&#8217;s latest steps toward this audio augmented reality experience, and paint a vision for the future of assistive agents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let’s talk about arms for a second. Or, rather, let’s talk about a lack of arms. It’s a common thread between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/04/the-lonely-death-of-jibo-the-social-robot/">Jibo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/kuri-maker-mayfield-robotics-will-cease-operations-in-october/">Kuri</a> and now Astro. I suppose one could make the argument that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/the-owner-of-ankis-assets-plans-to-relaunch-cozmo-and-vector-this-year/">Anki’s Cozmo</a> had arms of a kind, but the overhead forklift wasn’t good for much beyond hooking into a proprietary block.</p>
<p>Arms &#8212; or, rather, mobile manipulators, are hard. They’re a second-generation problem. Or maybe a third or fourth. Once you’ve proven out that enough people are interested in your new little home robot, then you can have those frank discussions about how much R&amp;D you want to dump into a pair of arms that can dust the counter and make sure your magazines are in an orderly pile without breaking down every two days. Maybe arms are when you start scanning the periphery for possible startup acquisitions.</p>
<p>To hear Amazon talk about it, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/why-amazon-built-a-home-robot/">Astro was created</a> without the aid of acquiring any specific companies. A lot of &#8220;ground up&#8221; development was required for what has thus far been a four-year project, most notably, the in-house development of a SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) system, so the robot knows where it is and where it’s going. And while the department worked with Amazon Robotics, the company’s industrial automation wing born out of its 2012 purchase of Kiva Systems, on-board technology from its autonomous cart system Canvas apparently didn’t factor in.</p>

<p>Credit to the person on Twitter who compared Astro’s look to a tablet mounted on a vacuum canister. We had, um, a lot of feedback on the site, but that was one of the more amusing comments and I think it &#8212; perhaps unintentionally &#8212; gets to something deeper about the $1,000/$1,500 robot. Astro exists at this kind of perfect nexus of Amazon hardware efforts, from Ring security to Echo Show.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s common refrain of “Alexa on wheels” isn’t entirely off-base. Astro is a kind of baby step into a world of more ubiquitous home robotics. There’s a consensus among many that we’ll get there in five, 10 or 15 years, but the most immediate question is how we get there &#8212; which is to say, what are the immediate stepping stones? For iRobot, it’s leveraging the home mapping of robotic vacuums and using that in tandem with home assistants like Alexa or Google. For Amazon, Alexa is that foundation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208853" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208853" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2208853" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0230.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0230.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208853" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>These are both fairly solid foundations from the standpoint of relative ubiquity. Pulling from some third-party research from last year, around a quarter of U.S. adults live with a smart speaker, and of those, almost 70% use Alexa. But even with numbers like that, the jump from Echo to Astro is still a big one. But credit to Amazon for giving it a go, even if its track record has made many consumers understandably weary of the messenger.</p>
<p>I spent a little time with Astro last week ahead of the launch and was impressed by what Amazon put together here. I wasn’t $1,500 worth of impressed. Pricing is going to be a pretty big hump to get over here (all of the caveats about that eventually coming down if Amazon can scale it), but the built quality is high and Astro is a clever combination of existing Amazon product lines, a few years of hard work and some clever workarounds like the periscope camera that pops out of the robot’s head.</p>

<p>There are questions swirling around whether a $1,500 robot can ever be a mainstream product from a company that trades in consumer electronics commodities (hell, I ask one below), but there&#8217;s a sense in which that is almost besides the point. It seems extremely unlikely that there will be an Astro in every home, but it does mean that Amazon is able to plant a flag here. Sure Samsung shows off a bunch of helper robots each year at CES, but until proven otherwise, they amount to little more than hypotheticals.</p>
<p>With Astro, Amazon announced a robot that&#8217;s going on sale soon &#8212; price prohibitive and invite-only as it may be. There&#8217;s a sense in which that&#8217;s a win in and of itself. Certainly Amazon hardware ambitions won&#8217;t live or die by the Astro&#8217;s success. Once they begin rolling out, the company could potentially have access to the largest wide scale home robotics trial for anything without a vacuum attached.</p>
<p>As Amazon Device VP Charlie Tritschler notes in our conversation below, Astro finds the company taking the first step toward a broader world of home robotics. Ultimately, Amazon&#8217;s consumer robotics might not look like Astro at all.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s start with the ‘why.’ Why is this something Amazon is actively pursuing?</strong></p>
<p>Given the fact that Amazon is always focused on customer experience, one of the things we look at is what are the upcoming technologies that can impact what’s available? In a senior meeting a few years ago, we were talking about just that. We talked about AI, computer vision, processing power. One of the topics that came up was robotics. How have robotics changed to make it possible now for consumers. We have a lot of experience using robotics in our fulfillment centers, of course, and we thought about what can we do to make robotics in the home more convenient for consumers or provide peace of mind as part of the experience. That started us thinking about it, and by the end, we were saying, ‘does anyone in the room think that we won’t have robots in the home in five to 10 years?’ And everyone said, ‘yeah, we will.’</p>
<p><strong>Obviously there are already Roombas in a lot of homes, but those are robots that do one very specific thing. I assume you began by looking beyond that application?</strong></p>
<p>The three big things that we saw ourselves that were confirmed with our beta testers were home monitoring &#8212; that’s both security and the ability to check in on the home remotely. The second is the ability to care for loved ones, especially when they’re remote and you can’t care for them all the time. And the third was Alexa: being able to take Alexa and being able to add intelligent mobility to give it new capabilities around the home.</p>

<p><strong>How much of the robot was built from scratch?</strong></p>
<p>Tough to give you a specific number, but the vast majority of it. We learned a lot, especially early on in the program, from other parts of the company. We already had robotics experience, like Amazon Robotics, who primarily focus on the fulfillment center and are looking at efficiency and making jobs easier. But we recognized as we started doing the work that to conquer the domain that is is the home &#8212; every home is different, every home changes all the time, as people move things around, put things down, drop a chair on the floor, put a backpack somewhere. So the team started looking at that and we realized we had to create our own SLAM experience.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing on the robot was the direct result of an acquisition?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>It struck me that Amazon’s purchase of Canvas would make sense from the standpoint of creating this fully autonomous [robot].</strong></p>
<p>If there’s tools that make sense &#8212; if there’s a simulation tool or other pieces, of course we will take advantage of those internal capabilities wherever possible, but the unique demands of creating a robot for the home means that we really did have to do a lot of invention to create the solution for consumers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208851" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208851" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2208851" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208851" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p><strong>What were the biggest challenges in developing Astro?</strong></p>
<p>Where can I start? One of the topics is just figuring out how do you conquer the technical problems. There were just so many places where we really needed to invent and create, which is hard to predict. You have to go in and start the work. We had many places during the development where we would go down a path, stop, come back, start, rethink and redo. So the overall complexity of the experience from a development perspective and all of the interdependencies between different systems were some of the biggest areas we had to overcome.</p>
<p><strong>What has the primary failing of home robotics been to this point?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think it’s failings. I think it’s just that we’ve taken a slightly different approach, which is we focused on what the end value is that we’re trying to create. And then we brought to bear all of the learnings that we have as Amazon with our robotics abilities and then applied all of our Amazon assets as well, like Alexa, Ring, Alexa Care or Amazon Kids.</p>
<p><strong>At what point was it clear this is something you could/should bring to market?</strong></p>
<p>We had the vision of it early on, but I think for me it was the very first time I saw it actually navigate a room by itself. Up until then, we thought we could do it. We’re smart people, we’re working on it. But to see it actually happen and move gracefully and avoid obstacles, when you place something in front of it. I knew that some of the core things that had to be true to make this work were achievable.</p>

<p><strong>Were there any major failings in the testing process that caused you to circle back?</strong></p>
<p>There were[…] SLAM, for instance, took a long time to get to the point where we could get it working well enough. People would say, &#8216;it stopped in the corner. I don’t know why, but it went over there and stopped.&#8217; SLAM had some issues.</p>
<p><strong>Do you anticipate the pricing will remain the same when Astro is available in a more mainstream way?</strong></p>
<p>Hard to know. I think that’s part of what we’ll hear from customers. Obviously, Amazon has a history of trying to provide more value to customers over time, and as the whole space of robotics and sensors come down, we will pass that onto the customer.</p>
<p><strong>You had the conversation four years ago when you said robotics would be mainstream in five to 10 years. We’re pushing right up against that deadline. Do you envision Astro as a mainstream product or a stepping stone?</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s the first of the robot series that we’re doing. That’s why it’s an invite-only program. We want to make sure that people that get Astro have a great experience with it, given the challenges of homes and different spaces. We think long-term when we think of consumer robotics. We want to have all different kinds of price points and capabilities and have a more directed mainstream product as part of that.</p>

<p>All right, I think that’s probably enough words about Amazon’s $1,500 home robot for now &#8212; at least until we spend some more time with the product, which will hopefully be in reasonably short order.</p>
<p>So we go out of the home and into the field for a pair of agtech raises. The first one, from Iron Ox, just missed the deadline for last week’s roundup, but it’s an interesting company doing interesting things in agtech that are worth mentioning here. The Bay Area firm isn’t strictly a robotics company, but the technology does play a big role in what it does.</p>

<p>Effectively, the company runs a robotic greenhouse as a “closed loop system” designed to grow produce with a significantly smaller environmental footprint than traditional farming &#8212; including a 90% reduction in water. Iron Ox just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/robotic-farming-firm-iron-ox-raises-53m/">announced</a> a $53 million Series C, which will go toward ramping up manufacturing, R&amp;D and making a bunch of new hires.</p>
<p>Burro, meanwhile, is a company that first hit my radar as Augean Robotics. The company participated in a TechCrunch pitch-off ahead of our 2020 Robotics event. Always cool to see a startup level-up like that. This week it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/burro-raises-10-9m-for-autonomous-produce-field-transport/">announced</a> a $10.9 million raise for its autonomous cart system, which is designed to relieve the burden of carrying crops for overworked field hands.</p>

<p>The technology, which Burro calls “pop-up autonomy,” makes a lot of sense in a world where there were labor constraints even prior to the pandemic. The company currently has around 90 robots in the field, which plans to expand to more than 500 next year.</p>
<p>Looping back around to a very different set of robotic arms, <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/business-technology-robotics-a03ec89db139ba6d7f936a8c8e52bfd3">GrayMatter this week</a> announced a $4.1 million seed round, co-led by Stage Venture Partners and Calibrate Ventures and featuring 3M Ventures, OCA Ventures, Pathbreaker Ventures and B Capital Group. Founded in 2020, the company leverages robotic systems to help manufacturers finish surfaces.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is shocking that millions of people still manually work on extremely tedious tasks that can be harmful to their health; younger generations do not want such jobs,&#8221; CEO Ariyan Kabir said in a release. &#8220;We want to improve shop workers&#8217; lives, enhance their productivity, and enable them to focus on higher-value tasks. Manufacturing drives our economy, and without automating surface finishing and treatment, there is a significant risk the global economy may suffer due to an increasing labor shortage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A U.K. law firm is bringing a class-action style claim over a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/04/concerns-raised-over-broad-scope-of-deepmind-nhs-health-data-sharing-deal/">patient health data scandal</a> that dates back to 2015 and involves the Google-owned AI company DeepMind, after it was quietly passed medical information on more than a million patients by an NHS Trust as part of an app development project.</p>
<p>Law firm Mishcon de Reya <a href="https://www.mishcon.com/news/confidential-medical-records-at-the-centre-of-a-new-claim-against-google">announced</a> the legal action today, saying a &#8220;representative action&#8221; has been filed on behalf of a U.K. citizen, called Mr Andrew Prismall, and the approximately 1.6 million others whose confidential medical records were obtained by DeepMind/Google without their knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>Google and the Royal Free NHS Trust have been contacted for comment on the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/google-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-streams-its-uk-clinician-support-app/">TechCrunch reported</a> that Google was pulling the plug on the clinician support app, Streams, which was developed by DeepMind and the London-based Royal Free NHS Trust starting in 2015.</p>
<p>The Streams app was rolled out for use by clinicians at the Royal Free and a handful of other NHS Trusts. However, the Royal Free was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/uk-data-regulator-says-deepminds-initial-deal-with-the-nhs-broke-privacy-law/">sanctioned in 2017</a> by the U.K.&#8217;s data protection watchdog, the ICO, for breaching data protection rules when it passed patients&#8217; sensitive medical information to the Google-owned company during the development phrase of the app.</p>
<p>In a press release today, Mishcon de Reya described the lawsuit as an &#8220;important step in seeking to address the very real public concerns about large-scale access to, and use of, private health data by technology companies&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It also raises issues regarding the precise status and responsibility of such technology companies in the data protection context, both in this specific case, and potentially more generally,&#8221; the firm added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During the height of the COVID-19 crisis last year, the U.K. government inked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/uks-covid-19-health-data-contracts-with-google-and-palantir-finally-emerge/">a number of health data processing contracts with tech giants, including Google and Palantir</a> &#8212; and those deals have also faced concern and criticism over a lack of transparency.</p>
<p>The government is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">consulting on whether to reduce the level of data protection</a> afforded to U.K. citizens, as it seeks to diverge from the European Union&#8217;s gold standard of privacy by design and default, set out in legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

<p>In a statement on why he&#8217;s taking the legal action, Prismall said: &#8220;Given the very positive experience of the NHS that I have always had during my various treatments, I was greatly concerned to find that a tech giant had ended up with my confidential medical records.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a patient having any sort of medical treatment, the last thing you would expect is your private medical records to be in the hands of one of the world&#8217;s biggest technology companies. I hope that this case will help achieve a fair outcome and closure for all of the patients whose confidential records were obtained in this instance without their knowledge or consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mishcon partner Ben Lasserson, who is leading the case, added: &#8220;This important claim should help to answer fundamental questions about the handling of sensitive personal data and special category data. It comes at a time of heightened public interest and understandable concern over who has access to people&#8217;s personal data and medical records and how this access is managed.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Mishcon de Reya confirmed to us that it has issued the claim in the U.K. High Court.</p>
<p>Asked about whether the claimant is seeking financial damages and/or asking for the data to be deleted she said she was unable to provide any more information at this early stage.</p>
<p>Most of the NHS Trusts that inked five-year deals with DeepMind to use the Streams software &#8212; contracts which subsequently transitioned to Google&#8217;s health division, after the company took over DeepMind Health in 2018 &#8212; told us they had terminated their arrangements <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/google-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-streams-its-uk-clinician-support-app/">when we asked them about their use of the app last month</a>, as it emerged Google was pulling the plug on the U.K. app following news of an internal reorganization of its health efforts.</p>
<p>However, the Royal Free Trust claimed it would continue to use Streams, despite Google&#8217;s announcement that support was being withdrawn &#8212; raising questions over how the Trust would ensure the app&#8217;s security was kept up-to-date and which divisions within Google would be responsible for handling related service level agreements, going forward, after the tech giant&#8217;s internal reorg of its health, wellness and AI efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just six months after raising $3.3 million in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/mexicos-higo-ai-nets-3-3m-to-become-the-venmo-for-b2b-payments-in-latam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seed funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mexico City-based Higo announced today it has raised $23 million in a Series A round led by Accel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global Management also participated in the financing, along with existing backers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haystack, Homebrew, Audacious, Susa Ventures and J Ventures. A number of angel investors also put money in the round, including Stripe COO Claire Hughes-Johnson and Cristina Cordova, former head of partnerships at Stripe.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, </span><a href="http://higo.io"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is out to transform B2B payments for SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) in Latin America, starting with its home country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodolfo Corcuera, Juan José Fernández and Daniel Tamayo founded the company in January 2020, recognizing that the process of paying vendors for business owners is largely “manual and cumbersome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Mexico, small businesses mostly handle payables with nothing more than spreadsheets and email and legacy bank accounts,” CEO </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodolfo-corcuera-meier-58377844/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corcuera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=IbIrrnWxXq" data-secret="IbIrrnWxXq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio formed Higo to automate processes and provide visibility into cash flow, particularly for small businesses. “Informal” businesses make up about 23% of Mexico’s GDP, according to data from </span><a href="https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/saladeprensa/boletines/2019/especiales/ENAPROCE2018.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">INEGI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the government’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Higo launched its SaaS platform last November with the goal of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“building the simplest way for businesses in Latin America to pay, collect and finance invoices.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company says it has grown “over 20x,” to thousands of companies paying and getting paid with its platform compared to just a handful at the beginning of 2021. Also, since its last funding round, the company has launched a financing product to help companies increase liquidity through AP (accounts payable) extension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We provide on-demand financing in case payments are late, making cash flow concerns a thing of the past,” Corcuera said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exec, who started two other Mexican startups in the past &#8212; Aliada and Tandem &#8212; likens Higo’s business to that of Venmo, but for businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Higo is the first B2B payments platform that automatically populates all invoices from a customer&#8217;s vendors &#8212; and provides a single ledger where users can approve, pay and finance these invoices without ever leaving our platform,” he said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of us a bit like Venmo for B2B, with the added ability to fully finance payments you need to make or receive, with one click.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higo began 2021 with five employees and now has 31, with the goal of having a staff of 60 by year’s end. It plans to use its new capital primarily for hiring across all teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Mexico, companies don’t get paid on time,” Corcuera said. “Even large companies struggle to meet deadlines, so we are helping companies get paid faster.” The startup has enterprise clients such as logistics provider 99minutos.com and e-commerce giant Jokr, as well as small companies like vinoschidos.mx, an online wine boutique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Higo remains committed to working in its home country, where Corcuera estimates there are 4.2 million SMEs, which employ 70% of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel’s <a href="https://www.accel.com/people/amit-kumar">Amit Kumar</a> notes that the Palo Alto-based firm has been “very active” investing in LatAm, and that Higo represents its largest Series A investment in the region. Accel, he said, increasingly believes there is significant opportunity in Latin America “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to build the next generation of fintech rails.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His firm, he said, was struck not just by Higo’s “laser focus” on B2B payments and its potential to accelerate the local SMB ecosystem, but also by its belief that the co-founding team is “building one of the best early-stage teams” that it’s seen globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Kumar thinks that Higo’s focus on invoices is the right one for LatAm, since that is where the vast majority of inter-company commerce is conducted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The growth velocity in terms of deposits, transactions and vendors onboarded all indicate they’ve solved a really important problem for a large swath of businesses and will accelerate this entire ecosystem,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV startup Lordstown Motors made headlines when it purchased a 6.2 million-square-foot factory from General Motors in 2019. Now, it looks like the strapped-for-cash startup will likely sell that facility to Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group.</p>
<p>The news was first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-30/lordstown-nears-deal-to-sell-ohio-car-plant-to-taiwan-s-foxconn">reported by Bloomberg</a>, who said unnamed sources suggested the deal could close as early as this week. Lordstown executives had said during a second-quarter earnings call that the company was in “serious discussions” with partners to lease the northeast Ohio facility to other companies, so news of the sale isn’t a total surprise.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lordstown will deliver its Endurance truck to &#8216;select early customers&#8217; early next year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/lordstown-will-deliver-its-endurance-truck-to-selected-early-customers-early-next-year/embed/#?secret=pMoxwlPxYL" data-secret="pMoxwlPxYL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While financial details of the transaction were not disclosed, Lordstown would reportedly operate in the facility in parallel with Foxconn &#8212; an arrangement that could, in the end, be a net benefit for the beleaguered EV maker, which would receive both a cash injection and Foxconn’s mass-manufacturing expertise.</p>
<p>Foxconn, though best known for manufacturing Apple’s iPhone, has made major strides to enter the electric vehicle manufacturing market over the past few years. The company has inked deals with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">EV startup Fisker</a> to co-develop and manufacture a new electric vehicle, and Foxconn will also start manufacturing up to 50,000 vehicles at a Thailand factory in partnership with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/foxconn-says-thailand-ev-factory-will-begin-producing-50000-units-by-2023/">Thai oil supplier PTT PLC</a>.</p>
<p>Foxconn’s ambitions don’t end there: the manufacturer envisions itself as becoming a contract manufacturer for automakers, and it formed a joint venture with Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group to provide design, R&amp;D and manufacturing to OEMs looking to sell EVs.</p>

<p>Lordstown is aiming to deliver the first models of its flagship electric truck &#8220;Endurance&#8221; to a small group of customers early next year. The company named a new chief executive in August, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">former CEO Steve Burns resigned</a> following concerns over the company’s coffers. CEO Dan Ninivaggi was instated scarcely a year after Lordstown announced its $1.6 billion SPAC merger.</p>
<p>At their 52-week highs, Lordstown shares hit $31.80 apiece. They’re now trading at $7.88.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Lordstown and Foxconn for comment and will update the story if they respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, Rivian showed up at the Overland Expo West in Flagstaff, Arizona with a prototype of what is now known as the Camp Kitchen. Now, with production ready 2022 Rivian R1T electric pickup trucks coming off the assembly line, the final version of the kitchen is ready for prime time.</p>
<p>The automaker has made a number of changes to the kitchen since it first debuted, including the addition of two supporting actors: a foundational shuttle system that the kitchen attaches to and a dishware set from Snow Peak.</p>
<p>Below is video that provides an up-close look of the production-ready Camp Kitchen, as well as information from Josh Glaser, the company&#8217;s senior culinary program manager (aka the food guy) on how the accessory has been used and tested in Rivian&#8217;s factory.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jf0LWv20o_4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>A few specs for you. The Camp Kitchen is a $5,000 optional upgrade. For a limited time, the tunnel shuttle and Snow Peak kitchen set are included. Eventually, buyers who opt for the kitchen will also have to buy the $1,500 Rivian Gear Tunnel Shuttle option, which the kitchen sits on.</p>
<p>This tunnel shuttle holds and powers the kitchen, which locks onto the platform in three sections. Rivian plans to use the shuttle for other accessories in the future. The shuttle has integrated dual power plugs — 120V AC and 12V DC — and can hold up to 200 pounds when extended out from the truck.</p>
<p>The kitchen, which has a Richlite (a durable compressed paper resin) surface, includes a 1,440-watt two-burner induction cooktop, a nearly four-gallon water tank with a pressurized pump, collapsible and removable sink and several drawers with cork inserts to hold the 30-piece kitchen set from Snow Peak. The set includes a nylon spatula, bamboo spatula, tongs, ladle, two knives, corkscrew, can opener, peeler, titanium cutlery set, tableware, stacking mugs, cutting board, two large pots, a coffee grinder, kettle and pour-over stand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There is even a string of lights that can be erected to provide a bit of ambiance at night.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It appears that India's startups utterly crushed previous venture records in Q3. What does that tell us? That India is precisely as bonkers-busy as we thought. And that it's coming for China.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ola Electric announced this morning that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/ola-electric-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">closed a $200 million round at a $3 billion valuation</a>. The EV company&#8217;s parent, Ola, is best known as an Indian ride-hailing platform. Ola itself has raised more than $4.5 billion to date, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ola">Crunchbase data</a>, while Ola Electric is now over the $500 million fundraising mark, if we&#8217;re doing our morning sums correctly.</p>
<p>That none of those numbers really surprised you is indicative of how active the Indian startup ecosystem has become. It seems that every <em>day</em> TechCrunch covers yet another new unicorn from the country, or at least a tidy nine-figure round as a consolation prize.</p>

<hr />
<p>I was curious about what early third-quarter data could tell us about India&#8217;s recent venture capital results. I&#8217;m also interested in whether all the noise coming from the country&#8217;s startup market was adding up to anything. So we&#8217;re doing a little bit of a data dive.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We&#8217;ll examine historical data from India, and then do some quick and dirty data pulls to get a handle on where the country is heading as Q3 comes to a close. And for comparison&#8217;s sake, we&#8217;ll loop in both historical and present data from the Chinese startup market to see how India stacks up.</p>
<h2>Venture capital in India</h2>
<p>When The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">examined Q2 2021 data from the global venture capital market,</a> we leaned on <a href="http://cbinsights.com">CB Insights&#8217; second-quarter data</a> to a large degree. That data set indicated that Indian startups raised $6.3 billion, a quarterly record.</p>
<p>Today, we ran India-focused queries <a href="http://pitchbook.com">in PitchBook</a>, keeping the data set constrained to venture-backed companies with their HQ in the country. We pulled both Q2 and Q3 numbers for this year, though, of course, the Q3 number is not quite finished; there are a few hours left.</p>
<p>The PitchBook query for Q2 Indian startup fundraising activity came in a little bit above ($6.81 billion) where CB Insights pegged the data. That PitchBook has a larger number for India&#8217;s Q2 a few months <em>after</em> CB Insights closed the books on its Q2 report is not surprising. Venture capital data is laggy, and quarters tend to fill in over time.</p>
<p>Regardless, with both $6.3 billion and $6.8 billion numbers for Indian venture capital fundraising in Q2, we have a good base to compare against for Q3. Which, per PitchBook data, includes more rounds and <em>far </em>more capital. Indeed, Indian startups have raised $17.23 billion, PitchBook reports, across some 459 deals in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Those numbers will wiggle around as PitchBook adds in what&#8217;s left in the quarter and cleans up the data. But regardless of whether we prefer the $6.3 billion or the $6.8 billion Q2 number, it <i>appears</i> that India&#8217;s startups utterly crushed previous venture records in the third quarter.</p>
<p>What does that tell us? That India is precisely as bonkers-busy as we thought. And that it&#8217;s coming for China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.activsurgical.com/">Activ Surgical</a>, a Boston-based digital surgery company, announced a $45 million Series B round on Thursday. The round comes during a critical year for Activ Surgical. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s in the process of developing new tools that give surgeons the ability to see otherwise invisible structures, and has plans to roll out those tools in the coming months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of those tools is the company’s hardware component, called ActivSight, which allows surgeons to see things that would otherwise be invisible, like blood flow through microscopic vessels inside tissue. The hardware, which received FDA 510(k) clearance in</span><a href="https://www.activsurgical.com/news/fda-clearance"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> April of 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fits between any type of endoscope and a white light camera system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the push of a button, ActivSight already allows features like blood flow (usually invisible, unless injectable dyes are used) to light up like a Christmas tree. But unlike injectable dye methods, ActivSight can visualize blood flow in real time (i.e. the images of tissue change color if blood flow slows or stops). </span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only system in the world that intraoperatively can visualize things like blood flow without the injection of any dyes,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: 400;">says CEO Todd Usen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This most recent round will be used to support the commercialization of ActivSight, which is expected to go live in hospital systems in seven states in Q4 2021 or into next year. It will also be used to help glean a CE certification &#8212; a marketing clearance that allows medical devices to be marketed in Europe &#8212; which will allow ActivSight to roll out in seven European countries in 2022. Finally, the round will support the buildout of Activ’s more ambitious AI-based projects, which will allow the ActivSight devices to identify even more key structures for surgeons who use it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round of funding was led by Cota Capital. Including Cota Capital, the round will bring seven new investors to Activ Surgical: BAM Funds, Magnetar Capital, Mint Ventures, Castor Ventures, Dream One Vision and Nvidia. The company has raised $77 million in funding so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activ Surgical first made headlines in 2016 for </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/scitranslmed.aad9398?keytype2=tf_ipsecsha&amp;ijkey=d78e1d9e122f1287c9599b650012ea86cff6b70c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating a robot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that performed the first totally autonomous suturing of soft tissue. The company’s founder, Peter Kim, holds a patent for a type of robot assisted surgery. But despite this, the company isn’t focused on building robots. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While robots are great, they’re only used in about 10% of minimally invasive surgeries. A robot can reach things that a human can’t but, until this point, a robot cannot see anything that a human can’t,” Usen says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the company is investing in tools that make surgeons themselves more savvy. Usen likens ActivSight’s current approach to installing a rear view camera on a car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your rearview camera on your car can see things that you can’t down below, then it will start beeping. When a robot can start identifying things a human can’t, that’s when robotics will really take off. That’s what Activ is doing, and that’s what our our robotic partner surgeons are excited about.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ActivSight has already shown that it can be used in the operating room. It’s been <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04633512">tested in a </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clinical trial on 70 patients at the University of Texas Health Science Center and the University of Buffalo. The results of those trials have not yet been released, but the company expects to publish data from that trial in October, a company PR confirmed to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the ActivSight system </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">already gleaned FDA 510(k) clearance, which means it will be rolling out in several hospital systems this year. Those include seven systems in New York, Buffalo, Texas, Ohio and Florida. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commercial deployment of ActivSight is just the first step for Activ Surgical. The goal is to ultimately collect a unique intraoperative data set based on surgeries completed with ActivSight. Then, a software suite called ActivInsight would analyze the data collected, and apply machine learning algorithms to help identify even more features that would otherwise be invisible to surgeons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have the most unique data set anywhere in the world,&#8221; says Usen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “From that we’re able to do autonomous annotation and label key structures. It’s collecting nerve identification, veins versus arteries, key critical structures &#8212; that information will be annotated and labeled using machine learning, and then fed back to anyone using the ActivInsight module on their scope.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This machine learning application won’t be rolled out right away. Usen expects ActivInsight prototypes to be used in patients for the first time in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this round of funding, those first steps will be set in motion. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[BGV’s portfolio makeup is 95% immigrant entrepreneurs and 60% outside Silicon Valley.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Silicon Valley-based venture capital (VC) firm <a href="http://www.bgv.vc">Benhamou Global Ventures</a>, known as BGV, closed its fourth fund with $110 million to support global enterprise companies.</p>
<p>The new fund is 60% larger than its third fund and will be invested similarly, in seed and Series A startups focused on what general partner Anik Bose said the firm calls the “Enterprise 4.0” domain. That means “AI-first B2B startups that apply deep tech to novel data sets coupled with workflow automation. Most importantly these startups do so without introducing unintended race, gender or age bias while addressing data privacy and security concerns and providing transparency.”</p>
<p>“We believe that the success of AI will be how effectively startups address these ethical issues,” Bose added. “There is a lot of fear about AI — some people associate it with ‘The Terminator’ movie, a loss of jobs or that ‘Big Brother’ is watching, and one of the challenges that happened is that there isn&#8217;t regulation on ethics right now. We can’t leave it to one company, founder or government, we all have to start doing work there.”</p>
<p>So far, the firm has invested in 28 companies — most recently being a part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/customer-success-company-totango-lands-100m-growth-investment/">Totango’s $100 million round</a> earlier this week, and saw 20 exits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bose anticipates adding 14 to 16 new companies to that list via the new fund. There have already been six investments made from the fund so far. The average check size for a seed is $2 million and $4 million for a Series A, he added.</p>
<p>In addition to AI ethics, when Eric Benhamou founded the firm in 2004, he also had a vision of immigrants helping immigrants, Bose said. As such, the company has offices in Palo Alto, Tel Aviv, Paris and Mumbai. Six out of the full-time nine investment team members are immigrants, and all three general partners are immigrants. In terms of the investments, BGV’s portfolio makeup is 95% immigrant entrepreneurs and 60% outside Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>“Immigration is a natural byproduct of our investment strategy,” Bose added. “We needed a diverse team, and we have already lived the journey of the entrepreneurs we invest in. We can empathize and understand what they have to do. We also believe that today, 50% of employees are minorities, and if you have a lack of diversity, you will miss out.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gifting has become a major lever in the world of building business relationships in the last 20 months. With in-person meetings reduced to a trickle, sending a gift to a colleague or business associate has become a more personalized way to reward, curry favor, or just keep in touch beyond the basics of pinging each other over a messaging platform, a zoom or an email. Today, <a href="https://www.reachdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reachdesk</a> &#8212; one of the companies that&#8217;s riding on the wave of that ever-expanding B2B gifting universe &#8212; is announcing that it has raised $43 million, a sign of the momentum in the space at the moment, with Reachdesk&#8217;s own business specifically growing 600% in the last year.</p>
<p>Highland Europe is leading the round, a Series B round of financing, with Highland Capital, HubSpot Ventures and RLC Ventures also participating. HubSpot is a strategic backer: Reachdesk integrates with a number of CRM and other business support tools, including HubSpot&#8217;s, to help those sending gifts manage their campaigns in a more organized way.</p>
<p>While the world of retail has a clear peak season for gift buying and giving that starts around Black Friday and ends just after the New Year, corporate gifting knows no start nor endpoint except for the beginning and completion (and ideally not the latter, but rather a continuing relationship) of a business association.</p>
<p>So with the market on an upswing to fill the vacuum left when in-person meetings disappeared off the calendar, there have been a number of other B2B gifting startups also seeing growth and raising money to fuel that. They include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/sendoso-nabs-100m-as-its-corporate-gifting-platform-passes-20000-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendoso</a>, which announced a $100 million round only a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/alyce-an-ai-based-personalised-corporate-gifting-startup-raises-30m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alyce</a>, which raised $30 million in April for a platform it says uses AI to improve the compatibility between the occasion, the sender and the person who is receiving the gift. (That&#8217;s not a bad aim, considering that hitting the target on the gift itself and sending something that feels right can mean all the difference between getting or not getting your desired outcome as the sender.) And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/open-raises-7-2m-from-first-round-capital-and-localglobe-to-send-gifts-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;Open</a> raised $7.2 million for its own twist on the model, a platform aimed specifically at sending B2B gifts at scale.</p>
<p>Reachdesk was founded in London in 2019 by Alex Olley, Jay Radia, Meelan Radia and Alex Correia-Santos, with Temy Mancusi-Ungaro joining as CEO in May of this year. The idea for the company came out of the same impulse that spurred the creation of at least one of the other startups in the space: personal experience.</p>
<p>Specifically, the two Radias &#8212; who are brothers &#8212; previously had co-founded Yieldify, a marketing startup that was backed by GV, among others. In that time and across other roles, they first-hand came to understand how manual the process was for gifting in the B2B world, and how it could be so much more meaningful &#8212; in the business sense, not the sentimental sense as you might have in a consumer gift &#8212; if it could be tied in with other software that people use to track and manage their business prospects and wider strategic planning.</p>
<p>Mancusi-Ungaro &#8212; who is based in Reachdesk&#8217;s other big center, New York &#8212; acknowledged that there are indeed a lot of similarities between different gifting businesses &#8212; it is, after all, a very well-defined and massive space, worth some $235 billion annually in the U.S. and U.K. alone &#8212; but the key differentiator with Reachdesk, he added, is that it is being operated as a global business, which gives customers the ability to use the platform in much bigger and more consolidated campaigns. That in turn gives the startup access to serving much bigger corporate customers, in addition to smaller ones, in a more efficient manner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company does this by providing three main buckets for gifting options. The first of these focuses on the company&#8217;s own inventory of items, a mix of a company&#8217;s own swag and items that it curates, which Reachdesk houses in colocated warehouses in different parts of the globe. The second is a marketplace, currently with some 50 vendors, that connects gift givers with a network of gift makers that focus on, say, personalised corporate gifts. The third area is the wide world of gift cards, with no physical boxes at all. The idea is to expand all three in the future.</p>
<p>While today most of the use cases for Reachdesk are still in the areas of sales and marketing, there are some emerging scenarios that speak to how it might grow, said Mancusi-Ungaro. These include more internal gifts for employees within your company; and potentially also gifts that a business might send out to its customers, B2B2C, if you would, with the &#8220;C&#8221; representing not clients, but customers of the business. In such a scenario you could imagine that the global reach and scale of Reachdesk might well come into play.</p>
<p>“The Reachdesk team truly understands the pain points faced by companies looking to break through to customers with effective marketing campaigns and has built a single solution that acutely addresses these,” said Laurence Garrett, partner at Highland Europe, in a statement.  “Every team member is passionate about making corporate gifting work for everyone involved, and has a unique take on it, one that is set to capitalize on the potential in this space, and become a clear market leader.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Messenger is releasing a bundle of products this morning &#8212; most notably, including cross-app group chats. Last year, the company introduced cross-app messaging between Messenger and Instagram, but now, users will be able to start group chats among Instagram and Messenger contacts.</p>
<p>Other additions today include polls in Instagram DMs, building off of the poll feature that exists in Messenger. Messenger is also adding a group typing feature to group DMs &#8212; regardless of which app you&#8217;re chatting on &#8212; to help users see when their friends are typing at the same time. Plus, as Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/facebook-reels-exits-beta-in-the-u-s-with-offers-to-pay-creators-for-well-performing-videos/">embraces video content</a>, users will now be able to use Messenger&#8217;s existing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together/">Watch Together</a> feature to view Instagram posts like Reels and IGTV videos at the same time.</p>

<p>These updates come just hours before the company is set to testify before the Senate about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">mental health harms</a> of Instagram and Facebook. But these additions have more to do with a separate government probe into Facebook&#8217;s operations. Facebook is facing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">lawsuit</a> from the Federal Trade Commission, alleging that Facebook is a monopoly and must be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/move-fast-and-break-facebook-a-bull-case-for-antitrust-enforcement/">broken up</a>. But as individual products under the Facebook umbrella rely on each other more and more, it could allow the company to argue that these apps are dependent on one another and cannot be separated. Last month, as Facebook Messenger celebrated its 10th anniversary, a Facebook spokesperson <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/messenger-celebrates-its-10th-anniversary-with-new-features-and-a-plan-to-become-the-connective-tissue-for-real-time-experiences/">told TechCrunch</a> that the company is thinking of Messenger as a &#8220;connective tissue regardless of the surface.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aside from updates that further integrate Facebook and Instagram, Messenger threw in a few fun ones for those of us who love customization and fear Mercury retrograde. Now, there&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cottagecore-trend-quarantine-diy_l_5ecd875ec5b6e3f6739dbdfc">cottagecore</a> chat theme, as well as an astrology-themed suite of chat themes, stickers, and Instagram AR filters. Because what do the teens love more than cottagecore and star charts?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The larger a coding project gets, and the more people become involved, the harder it becomes to get a big picture view of how the entire project fits together, and this is especially true for distributed teams. Today, <a href="https://www.codesee.io/">CodeSee</a>, an early stage startup that wants to help development teams understand the entire code base, released <a href="http://www.oss-port.com/">OSS Port</a>, an open source project designed to help disparate open source teams do just that.</p>
<p>While it was at it, the company also announced a $3 million seed round it received last year and had not revealed previously. Boldstart Ventures and Uncork Capital co-led that round with participation from DCVC, Precursor Ventures and Salesforce Ventures and several other angel investors.</p>
<p>Overall CodeSee&#8217;s goal is to help companies visualize and understand their code, something that has become increasingly challenging as the sheer volume and number of developers involved grow. &#8220;CodeSee is a developer tool that helps developers and teams deeply understand how the code works,&#8221; CEO Shanea Leven, who co-founded the company with her husband CTO Josh Leven, explained.</p>
<p>CEO Leven says they created an open source product for starters because they see a real need for this service in open source projects with a variety of developers from around the world, and new people joining all the time, to get a holistic sense of the code base. She believes that if CodeSee works for these projects, it will act as proof of concept of sorts for the commercial version of the product.</p>
<p>Leven, who has more than a decade of experience in various levels of product management at companies like Docker and Cloudflare has seen what happens when engineering teams don&#8217;t understand the connections across the entire code base. In extreme cases, when things went wrong, it led to release deadlines slipping. As she watched this play out, she kept thinking there should be a way to help them understand how it all fits together. Eventually she decided to start a company to solve the problem.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210266" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210266" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210266" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/josh-and-shanea.jpg?w=680" alt="Josh Leven, CTO and Shanea Leven, CEO at CodeSee" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/josh-and-shanea.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/josh-and-shanea.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/josh-and-shanea.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/josh-and-shanea.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/josh-and-shanea.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/josh-and-shanea.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210266" class="wp-caption-text">CodeSee founders CTO Josh Leven and CEO Shanea Leven.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> CodeSee</p></div></p>
<p>Ed Sim, who is managing partner at lead investor Boldstart, sees this ability to understand the code base as a missing component in the development process, and one that could help companies retain engineering talent. That&#8217;s because engineers will typically leave after 12 months if they can&#8217;t master the code base.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a product to help people master the codebase [faster], and bring this visual approach to it, then we saw that it could be an absolutely massive opportunity to unlock value and to ship better code faster, and that&#8217;s what Shanea really demonstrated to us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As Leven and her husband built the company over the last 18 months, they now have 10 employees, and CEO Leven, who is Black, says that her personal experience led her to build a very deliberate welcoming and inclusive culture at her company. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been involved with a lot of startups. And my take on building a culture is that one of the greatest joys of being a CEO is that I get to build the inclusive culture that I wish that I [always] had,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She added, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have the perfect ratio. We&#8217;re not perfect in any way. But we do [think about] culture as a mandatory, necessary part of our day-to-day experience. We don&#8217;t think of it separately &#8212; this is the company and this is diversity and inclusion. Diversity and inclusion is built in at a fundamental level of our company,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>While the company has developed during the pandemic and is spread out geographically, she thinks often about what the company will look like as it grows, and while she is still considering it, she is thinking about building local hubs where there are clusters of employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;There might be some kind of alternative hubs, but we will discuss that as a team and we&#8217;ll try to scale and do whatever feels right for folks, but not before vaccines come out for children,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alloy, which has built an identity operating system for banks and fintechs, announced Thursday that it has raised $100 million at a $1.35 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightspeed Venture Partners led the Series C round, which comes just over one year after New York-based Alloy raised $40 million in a Series B financing. Existing backers Canapi Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Avid Ventures and Felicis Ventures all put money in the latest round, bringing Alloy’s total raised to over $150 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://alloy.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alloy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was founded primarily to fix a “broken” onboarding process that has historically involved manual review when people applied for bank accounts online. Put simply, the startup’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s initial mission was to help banks and fintechs make better identity and risk decisions using its single API service and SaaS platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ove</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">r the last year, Alloy has evolved that platform to not only</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">automate onboarding identity decisions but to also automate transaction monitoring and soon, credit underwriting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also over the past 12 months, the company has seen its annual recurring revenue (ARR) triple and number of customers double, according to Alloy CFO Kiran Hebbar.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, the company has more than 200 clients, including Ally Bank, HMBradley, Brex, Marqeta, Gemini, Ramp and Evolve Bank &amp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust &#8212; up from 90 at this time last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alloy connects its users to data from 120 identity providers, and then uses that data to help financial institutions avoid fraud during initial customer onboarding and when conducting ongoing transactions. Questions it aims to answer for banks and fintechs include: “Is this a real person? Will they defraud us?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it does it by giving them a way to create instant decisioning systems that are customized to their needs from a regulatory compliance and risk perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s really hard for fintech companies and banks to deploy products that are both safe for them, meaning they won’t take on a bunch of fraud or compliance losses, but also seamless for their users,” said CEO and co-founder Tommy Nicholas.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What has historically ended up happening is that financial institutions’ efforts to mitigate risk have resulted in less than ideal user experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our entire mission is to make that go away and have risk be something you can just install and put into the background to solve all the problems of users who can take money from you,” Nicholas told TechCrunch. “And we’ve gotten really good at helping them automate and optimize those processes. We&#8217;re basically asking people to take the most important processes that they run and put those into one central system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more companies become fintechs, or rather embed things like payments into their platforms (e-commerce companies are a prime example), Alloy has seen an increase in the number of companies that could take advantage of what it does, according to Nicholas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as mentioned above, the company has now expanded into transactional monitoring, with plans to launch a product focused on credit underwriting later this year.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209998" style="width: 1314px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209998" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2209998 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TM-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="1304" height="956" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TM-screenshot.jpg 1304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TM-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TM-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TM-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,563 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TM-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,499 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TM-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1304px) 100vw, 1304px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209998" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alloy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital mainly toward building out “continuously evolving” customer identity</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">profiles that can be used to prevent fraud and minimize risk. Down the line, Alloy plans to incorporate “richer data and risk signals” with the mission of giving banks and fintechs a 360-degree view of their customers. It also, simply, wants to improve the developer experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make building a fintech product as easy as building an e-commerce product,” Nicholas said. </span><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identity and its associated risk isn’t something businesses should be figuring out, it</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">should just be something they install. As Alloy grows&#8230;we can not only help make risk easier to understand, but also further</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">industry innovation by making fintech products easier to build.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Overdorff, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, first invested in Alloy as an angel in its Series A round of funding in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When that round happened, I acutely had firsthand knowledge and experience of this problem at Stripe, going through the process of cobbling together sources of data for many years,” he recalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process, he said, was “very, very challenging.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You want to say yes to as many of the best customers as possible,” Overdorff said, “but you don’t want false positives or to turn away good customers, because every good customer you turn away, that&#8217;s revenue that’s lost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experience made him “intrigued” by what Alloy was building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For me the exciting thing is that revenue is growing rapidly, the company is growing rapidly,” he told TechCrunch. “I think the big picture here is that the opportunity is just quite large. There&#8217;s a proliferation of the number of financial service companies, both big and small, and even to some extent some software companies, that are embedding financial services in their products….And every single one of those companies is going to need to onboard customers and go through that KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-money laundering) onboarding process initially.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature/">began beta testing</a> new features to make podcasts more interactive through the use of listener polls and Q&amp;As. Today, the company says these features will become publicly available to all creators through its podcast creation app, Anchor.</p>
<p>To use the new options, creators who publish and distribute using Anchor will be able to post a question or poll alongside their episode. At present, Anchor supports adding just one poll and one Q&amp;A to an individual episode, not several.</p>
<p>When the podcast is published on Spotify, the polls and Q&amp;As will appear at the bottom of the podcast&#8217;s episode page on the Spotify mobile app, both iOS and Android. Listeners can then follow the prompt to respond to the poll or Q&amp;A in the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210480" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210480" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210480" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210480" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>After responding to the poll, listeners will immediately be able to view how the rest of the podcast audience voted so they can see how their own answers stacked up. But their Q&amp;A responses are delivered privately to the podcaster. The podcast creator can choose to pin specific responses that will appear publicly below the question. These will display the listener&#8217;s Spotify username, so the feature should be used with that in mind. In other words, this feature is the podcast equivalent of the radio call-in &#8212; except it&#8217;s not live or recorded audio from the listener, it&#8217;s text.</p>
<p>These features have been in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spotify-adds-an-interactive-feature-for-podcasts-with-launch-of-polls/">testing</a> before today&#8217;s public launch with hundreds of creators throughout the year. During this time, the company says creators have used Q&amp;As to ask for suggestions for future guests, get feedback about topic choice and format, and add gamification elements to their programs, where listeners are encouraged to return to hear what the hosts say about the listeners&#8217; response.</p>

<p>The new features are now being made available to any Anchor creators and Spotify users in 160 markets around the world. This is not Spotify&#8217;s entire global footprint, which is today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/">178 markets per its website</a>. But it is a large majority.</p>
<p>Interactivity is just one way that Spotify has been working to revamp the traditional podcast experience. The company has also rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">paid podcast subscriptions</a>, a combined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/spotify-expands-its-radio-dj-like-format-music-talk-to-global-creators/">&#8220;Music + Talk&#8221; show format</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/spotifys-clubhouse-clone-adds-six-new-weekly-shows-some-that-tie-to-spotify-playlists/">an app for hosting &#8220;live&#8221; shows</a>, called Spotify Greenroom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ola Electric said on Thursday it has raised over $200 million in a new financing round at a valuation of $3 billion, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/ola-electric-softbank/">$1 billion two years ago</a>, as it looks to scale its electric vehicle manufacturing business in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Falcon Edge Capital led the financing round, the Bangalore-based startup said. SoftBank also participated in the new round, which hasn&#8217;t closed. TechCrunch reported last month that the startup was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ola-electric-in-talks-to-raise-at-over-2-5-billion-valuation/">talks to raise at over $2.75 billion</a> valuation.</p>
<p>The fundraise follows Ola Electric recently launching its first electric scooter, called Ola S1, that is priced at 99,999 Indian rupees, or $1,350. The electric scooter offers a range of 121 kilometers (75 miles) on a complete charge. The startup said it had sold scooters worth $150 million in just two days.</p>
<p>The startup, which was once the part of the ride-hailing giant Ola, said it will deploy the fresh funds to accelerate development of other vehicle platforms including electric motorbike, mass market scooter and its electric car. It&#8217;s also setting up what is the world&#8217;s largest manufacturing factory for electric scooters. The 500-acre factory in the Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu will have a capacity to produce roughly one electric scooter every two seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re proud to lead the EV revolution from India to the world. India has the talent and the capability to build technologies of the future for the industries of the future for the entire world. I thank our existing investors and welcome new ones to Ola. Together we will bring mobility to a billion and sustainability to the future,&#8221; said Bhavish Aggarwal, founder and chief executive of Ola, in a statement. Aggarwal, pictured above, is also the founder and chief executive of Ola Electric.</p>
<p>In recent quarters, Aggarwal has urged New Delhi, and players in the industry to evolve from using gasoline-powered vehicles and switch to those run by electric by 2025.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ola is seriously exploring the public markets and may file the paperworks for an initial public offering this year. Ahead of it, the startup recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/temasek-and-warburg-pincus-invest-500-million-in-ola/">closed a $500 million financing round</a> from Temasek, Warburg Pincus, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/meesho-india-social-commerce-raises-570-million/">Aggarwal</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India&#8217;s startup ecosystem, a journey which kickstarted in late 2000s, is finally beginning to produce firms that have matured to stages where they can become public companies. And retail investors are showing great interest, too.</p>
<p>Food delivery startup Zomato had a stellar debut on Indian stock exchanges earlier this year. Scores of other firms including Paytm, MobiKwik, CarTrade, Nykaa, and PolicyBazaar have filed the paperworks for their initial public offerings. Indian hospitality giant Oyo is expected to follow suit as soon as this week, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/indias-oyo-to-file-for-1-billion-ipo/">reported earlier</a>.</p>
<p>Barring Oyo publishing its IPO paperwork later today, Ola&#8217;s announcement caps a buzzy day for the Indian startup ecosystem. Social commerce firm Meesho earlier today said it had raised $570 million in a round led by B Capital Group and Fidelity. The round valued Meesho at $4.9 billion, up from $2.1 billion value it had been priced at in its previous funding round in April.</p>
<p>OfBusiness, a business-to-business commerce unveiled this afternoon that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/tiger-global-backs-india-ofbusiness-at-3-billion-valuation/">raised over $200 million</a>, too, in a round led by Tiger Global. Like Ola Electric, OfBusiness is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/meesho-india-social-commerce-raises-570-million/">also valued at $3 billion</a>. The startup&#8217;s equity was priced at $800 million in April this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OfBusiness, a commerce startup that sells industrial goods and provides small businesses with credit, has doubled its valuation in less than two months to $3 billion, a top executive told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the six year-old startup’s $207 million Series F round, and SoftBank and Alpha Wave participated in it, OfBusiness co-founder and chief executive Asish Mohapatra told us. The new investment comes just two months after SoftBank led a $160 million round in OfBusiness at a $1.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Thursday’s announcement is the third financing round for OfBusiness this year. The startup, whose business has grown multiple folds this year, was valued at $800 million in April this year.</p>
<p><a href="http://ofbusiness.com">OfBusiness</a> operates as a raw material aggregator and procurement finance provider. The startup works with banks to offer credit lines to small and medium enterprises that have an annual turnover of over $3 million.</p>
<p>The platform collects data on user activity that it relies on to underwrite loans to businesses that are using the OfBusiness platform for sourcing raw material and tenders. “This enables us to move from collateral based loans to cash-flow/ transaction-based lending – a key differentiator to banks,&#8221; Mohapatra told Bernstein analysts last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The SMEs pay interest on their working capital loan (issued in form of card limits), and a margin on the raw material procured. Bid-Assist platform is a repository for SMEs to look up tenders suitable for their business. The tender sourcing and raw material margin provide better monetization and more importantly, predictive data useful for underwriting.”</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s revenue run-rate is over $1 billion, and it&#8217;s profitable. By July this year, its loan book size had increased to $220 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We provide credit lines, akin to cash-credit/ overdraft. Borrowers pay interest only on the limits drawn and are required to procure raw material from the platform. This provides us with a view on end-use of the loan and data for fresh underwriting and monitoring. Borrowers using leverage for inventory are better than those using loans to pay off old loans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its operations in India. OfBusiness is also eyeing merger and acquisitions opportunities, the startup said.</p>
<p>OfBusiness is Tiger Global&#8217;s latest investment in India. The New York-headquartered firm has backed nearly two dozen startups in the country this year, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/tiger-global-led-100m-investment-makes-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">Apna</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/india-fintech-bharatpe-valued-at-2-85-billion-in-tiger-global-led-370-million-funding/">BharatPe</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/business-messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-240-million-from-tiger-global-fidelity-and-others/">Gupshup</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/indian-social-commerce-dealshare-raises-144-million-eyes-international-expansion/">DealShare</a>, Classplus, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/home-services-platform-urban-company-raises-255-million-at-2-1-billion-valuation/">Urban Company</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/tiger-global-backs-indian-crypto-startup-coinswitch-kuber-at-over-500m-valuation/">CoinSwitch Kuber</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">Groww</a>.</p>
