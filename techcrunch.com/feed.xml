										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a> today announced Armv9, the next generation of its chip architecture. Its predecessor, Armv8 launched a decade ago and while it has seen its fair share of changes and updates, the new architecture brings a number of major updates to the platform that warrant a shift in version numbers. Unsurprisingly, Armv9 builds on V8 and is backward compatible, but it specifically introduces new security, AI, signal processing and performance features.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, more than 100 billion Arm-based chips have shipped. But Arm believes that its partners will ship over 300 billion in the next decade. We will see the first ArmV9-based chips in devices later this year.</p>
<p>Ian Smythe, Arm&#8217;s VP of Marketing for its client business, told me that he believes this new architecture will change the way we do computing over the next decade. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to deliver more performance, we will improve the security capabilities [&#8230;] and we will enhance the workload capabilities because of the shift that we see in compute that&#8217;s taking place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The reason that we&#8217;ve taken these steps is to look at how we provide the best experience out there for handling the explosion of data and the need to process it and the need to move it and the need to protect it.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That neatly sums up the core philosophy behind these updates. On the security side, ArmV9 will introduce Arm&#8217;s confidential compute architecture and the concept of Realms. These Realms enable developers to write applications where the data is shielded from the operating system and other apps on the device. Using Realms, a business application could shield sensitive data and code from the rest of the device, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132120" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132120" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2132120" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png" alt="" width="1024" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png 1131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/arm_future_v9.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2132120" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arm</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing with the Arm Confidential Compute Architecture is worrying about the fact that all of our computing is running on the computing infrastructure of operating systems and hypervisors,&#8221; Richard Grisenthwaite, the chief architect at Arm, told me. &#8220;That code is quite complex and therefore could be penetrated if things go wrong. And it&#8217;s in an incredibly trusted position, so we&#8217;re moving some of the workloads so that [they are] running on a vastly smaller piece of code. Only the Realm manager is the thing that&#8217;s actually capable of seeing your data while it&#8217;s in action. And that would be on the order of about a 10th of the size of a normal hypervisor and much smaller still than an operating system.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Grisenthwaite noted, it took Arm a few years to work out the details of this security architecture and ensure that it is robust enough &#8212; and during that time Spectre and Meltdown appeared, too, and set back some of Arm&#8217;s initial work because some of the solutions it was working on would&#8217;ve been vulnerable to similar attacks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132100" style="width: 703px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132100" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2132100" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png" alt="" width="693" height="435" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png 693w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-30-101359.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2132100" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arm</p></div></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, another area the team focused on was enhancing the CPU&#8217;s AI capabilities. AI workloads are now ubiquitous. Arm had already done introduced its Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) a few years ago, but at the time, this was meant for high-performance computing solutions like the Arm-powered Fugaku supercomputer.</p>
<p>Now, Arm is introducing SVE2 to enable more AI and digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities. Those can be used for image processing workloads, as well as other IoT and smart home solutions, for example. There are, of course, dedicated AI chips on the market now, but Arm believes that the entire computing stack needs to be optimized for these workloads and that there are a lot of use cases where the CPU is the right choice for them, especially for smaller workloads.</p>
<p>&#8220;We regard machine learning as appearing in just about everything. It&#8217;s going to be done in GPUs, it&#8217;s going to be done in dedicated processors, neural processors, and also done in our CPUs. And it&#8217;s really important that we make all of these different components better at doing machine learning,&#8221; Grisenthwaite said.</p>
<p>As for raw performance, Arm believes its new architecture will allow chip manufacturers to gain more than 30% in compute power over the next two chip generations, both for mobile CPUs but also the kind of infrastructure CPUs that large cloud vendors like AWS now offer their users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arm’s next-generation Armv9 architecture offers a substantial improvement in security and machine learning, the two areas that will be further emphasized in tomorrow&#8217;s mobile communications devices,&#8221; said Min Goo Kim, the executive vice president of SoC development at Samsung Electronics. &#8220;As we work together with Arm, we expect to see the new architecture usher in a wider range of innovations to the next generation of Samsung’s Exynos mobile processors.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced that it is rolling out <a href="http://web.dev/FloC">Federated Learning of Cohorts</a> (FLoC), a crucial part of its <a href="https://www.privacysandbox.com/">Privacy Sandbox project</a> for Chrome, as a developer origin trial.</p>
<p>FLoC is meant to be an alternative to the kind of cookies that advertising technology companies use today to track you across the web. Instead of a personally identifiable cookie, FLoC runs locally and analyzes your browsing behavior to group you into a cohort of like-minded people with similar interests (and doesn&#8217;t share your browsing history with Google). That cohort is specific enough to allow advertisers to do their thing and show you relevant ads, but without being so specific as to allow marketers to identify you personally.</p>
<p>This &#8220;interest-based advertising,&#8221; as Google likes to call it, allows you to hide within the crowd of users with similar interests. All the browser displays is a cohort ID and all your browsing history and other data stay locally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2131299" style="width: 867px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131299" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131299" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png" alt="" width="857" height="708" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png 857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png?resize=768,634 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png?resize=680,562 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/google_cohorts.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131299" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>The trial will start in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and the Philippines. Over time, Google plans to scale it globally. As we learned earlier this month, Google is not running any tests in Europe because of <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/google-will-not-run-floc-origin-tests-in-europe-due-to-gdpr-concerns/">concerns around GDPR</a> and other privacy regulations (in part, because it&#8217;s unclear whether FLoC IDs should be considered personal data under these regulations).</p>
<p>Users will be able to opt out from this origin trial, just like they will be able to do so with all other Privacy Sandbox trials.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, given how FLoC upends many of the existing online advertising systems in place, not everybody loves this idea. Advertisers obviously love the idea of being able to target individual users, though Google&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/">preliminary data</a> shows that using these cohorts leads to similar results for them and that advertisers can expect to see &#8220;at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google notes that its own advertising products will get the same access to FLoC IDs as its competitors in the ads ecosystem.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;3 adtech and martech VCs see major opportunities in privacy and compliance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/3-adtech-and-martech-vcs-see-major-opportunities-in-privacy-and-compliance/embed/#?secret=KfIoUclonx" data-secret="KfIoUclonx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just the advertising industry that is eyeing this project skeptically. Privacy advocates aren&#8217;t <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">fully sold on the idea either</a>. The EFF, for example, argues that FLoC will make it easier for marketing companies that want to fingerprint users based on the various FLoC IDs they expose, for example. That&#8217;s something Google is addressing with its Privacy Budget proposal, but how well that will work remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, users would probably prefer to just browse the web without seeing ads (no matter what the advertising industry may want us to believe) and without having to worry about their privacy. But online publishers continue to rely on advertising income to fund their sites.</p>
<p>With all of these divergent interests, it was always clear that Google&#8217;s initiatives weren&#8217;t going to please everyone. That friction was always built into the process. And while other browser vendors can outright block ads and third-party cookies, Google&#8217;s role in the advertising ecosystem makes this a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;When other browsers started blocking third-party cookies by default, we were excited about the direction, but worried about the immediate impact,&#8221; Marshall Vale, Google&#8217;s product manager for Privacy Sandbox, writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Excited because we absolutely need a more private web, and we know third-party cookies aren&#8217;t the long-term answer. Worried because today many publishers rely on cookie-based advertising to support their content efforts, and we had seen that cookie blocking was already spawning privacy-invasive workarounds (such as fingerprinting) that were even worse for user privacy. Overall, we felt that blocking third-party cookies outright without viable alternatives for the ecosystem was irresponsible, and even harmful, to the free and open web we all enjoy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that FLoC, as well as Google&#8217;s other privacy sandbox initiatives, are still under development. The company says the idea here is to learn from these initial trials and evolve the project accordingly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vote counting begins today in the historic effort to unionize Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama fulfillment center. The warehouse &#8212; which opened exactly a year ago to meet ramping up demand as COVID-19 bore down on the U.S. &#8212; has become ground zero for one of the most import labor efforts in modern American history.</p>
<p>Voting began by mail on February 8, after Amazon repeatedly attempted to delay the vote or force workers to submit ballots in-person, in spite of pandemic restrictions. Things have gotten predictably heated in the days and weeks leading up to yesterday’s official deadline. Though even by the standards of Amazon’s aggressive public relations strategy, thing went surprisingly far.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is extraordinary and revealing. One of the most powerful politicians in the United States just said she’s going to break up an American company so that they can’t criticize her anymore. <a href="https://t.co/Nt0wcZo17g">https://t.co/Nt0wcZo17g</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Amazon News (@amazonnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1375529101931520007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In particular, the e-commerce giant leveraged Twitter feeds as part of an aggressive anti-union strategy. The company simultaneously sought to bolster its image of existing working conditions while confronting progressive/leftist politicians like Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who played a key role in pushing the company toward the $15/hour warehouse minimum wage it now celebrates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren">According to reports</a>, the company’s scorched-earth approach against Sanders and fellow New England Senator Elizabeth Warren were spurred on from the top. Founder Jeff Bezos &#8212; who will abdicate his CEO position later this year &#8212; was said to have encouraged the offensive. Employees at the companies were said to have flagged the offending tweets internally for suspicious activity. Those tickets were reportedly closed.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8lpsW7A50s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/">Amazon goes on the offensive ahead of next week’s union vote counting</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon goes on the offensive ahead of next week’s union vote counting&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/embed/#?secret=8lpsW7A50s" data-secret="8lpsW7A50s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After antagonist tweets and denying widespread and longstanding reports about Amazon workers peeing in bottles over fears of falling behind on quotas, the Amazon News Twitter reverted to a more positive approach. It has however, continued activity around the vote, including <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/amazon-loses-effort-to-install-camera-to-watch-ballot-box-in-union-vote.html">a bid to install video cameras</a> for monitoring boxes carrying ballots &#8212; a bid the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has since rejected.</p>
<p>While the vote counting kicks off today, don’t expect immediate results. The process is a methodical and deliberate one. Among other things, there are processes in place for either side to object. It’s clear from Amazon’s recent behavior that the company is well aware that this is far more consequential than the 6,000 or so workers currently employed by the Bessemer location. If the company prevails, it will position the decision as validation of its working conditions. If workers vote to unionize, meanwhile, this could well start a chain reaction across the company.</p>

<p>This week, workers at Amazon’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-germany-strike-idUSKBN2BK0GU">Germany facilities are going on strike</a> for four days, following a similar move in Italy last week.</p>
<p>“It’s not just workers in Alabama, it’s workers everywhere who are saying to Jeff Bezos that enough is enough. No matter what language they speak, Amazon workers around the globe will not stand for the working conditions they’ve been forced to endure for too long,” Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) President Stuart Applebaum said in a statement.</p>
<p>The NLRB oversees the vote counting. If workers vote to unionize, Bessemer workers will join the RWDSU. The organization has also seen its share of pushback from Amazon. As the company told TechCrunch last week:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stuart Appelbaum, Chief Disinformation Officer of RWDSU, in an attempt to save his long declining union, is taking alternative facts to a whole new level. But our employees are smart and know the truth—starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encourage all of our employees to vote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ballots have been sent to the NLRB’s Birmingham offices. There are a number of grounds on which either side can contest the results. These include everything from signatures to whether the person who cast a vote is, in fact, an eligible employee of Amazon. Even after votes are counted, things are likely to drag on. Court battles seem a likely outcome, moving forward. From there, things could ultimately stretch on for weeks or months.</p>

<p>The battle is a high stakes one that has made unusual political allies from opposite sides of the aisle. There aren’t too many events that have united politicians ranging from Marco Rubio on one side and Sanders, Warren and Joe Biden on the other. That goes double for something as traditionally divisive as labor unions.</p>
<p>“This campaign has already been a victory in many ways,” Appelbaum said in a statement issued late last week. “Even though we don’t know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The NFT craze has been an intriguing moment for digital artists who have seen seen great leaps in how tech has allowed them to create their work, but not as much progress in shifting how they profit off of it.</p>
<p>Though crypto&#8217;s early adopter artists have seemed to gain the most attention thus far, more institutionally present artists are dipping their feet into the token world. One of the bigger barriers has been the environmental concerns tied to the Ethereum blockchain which required intense energy usage to mint new artwork, tied to incredibly high transaction fees, something that has invited controversy for early artists because of climate change cocerns.</p>
<p>There have been a number of blockchain products to emerge in recent months that promise the benefits of Ethereum with greater speed, lower costs and lower energy usage, most notably Dapper Labs&#8217; Flow blockchain which powers their NBA Top Shot product. Today, we saw the debut of a new &#8220;layer-two&#8221; entrant from <a href="https://consensys.net/">ConsenSys</a>, called Palm, which operates as a sidechain on Ethereum&#8217;s main network but will be supported via the popular crypto wallet MetaMask.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of Palm&#8217;s launch, the artist Damien Hirst announced he will be launching an NFT project, his first, called <em>The Currency Project</em> on the platform&#8217;s <a href="https://palm.io/">Palm NFT Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Ethereum has already committed to transitioning to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus structure, but it&#8217;s unclear how quickly that&#8217;s going to happen. The network currently relies on a proof-of-work system (as does bitcoin), which use an energy-intensive manner of prioritizing where the next block in a chain is mined that gets more intensive as a network sees more traffic. It&#8217;s a reason why crypto mining operations have had to consistently invest in the latest hardware to maintain an edge and use more power. Proof-of-work does away with most of that, instead choosing nodes on the network to mine the next block based on reputation or their existing stake. There are some real security tradeoffs which have required workarounds though plenty in the crypto community aren&#8217;t quite satisfied with the compromises, though proponents argue that environmental concerns should take precedent.</p>
<p>In a press release, the team behind Palm says the ecosystem is &#8220;99% more energy efficiency than proof of work systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike Dapper Labs&#8217; Flow, Palm benefits from its interconnectedness with the community of Ethereum developers, something that was present in today&#8217;s announcement which showcased several industry partnerships including Nifty. The news arrived alongside details this morning of Dapper Labs&#8217; monster $305 million fund raise which will give the company backing to build on the momentum of Top Shot which has given the broader NFT space the wave of enthusiasm it&#8217;s currently experiencing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s in-house incubator, Area 120, is today releasing its latest project called <a href="https://stack.area120.com/">Stack</a>, an app that will help you digitize your documents, receipts and other papers you have lying around the house, and then automatically save them to Google Drive. The app will also helpfully suggest a name for your scans and the right category &#8212; or &#8220;stack,&#8221; as it&#8217;s called.</p>
<p>At launch, Stack can handle scanning a range of differently-sized documents &#8212; like bills, shopping receipts, or even IDs &#8212; which are then turned into PDFs and organized, while important information from within the file is detailed using A.I. technology.</p>
<p>The idea for Stack comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedregal/">Christopher Pedregal</a>, who previously co-founded the edtech startup Socratic which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/google-discloses-its-acquisition-of-mobile-learning-app-socratic-as-it-relaunches-on-ios/">acquired by Google back in 2018. </a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pedregal notes that, at Socratic, they had taken advantage of Google&#8217;s computer vision and language understanding technologies to make learning easier for high school students. While at Google, he began to think about how those same technologies could be put to work for better organizing documents. To experiment with the idea, he teamed up with Matthew Cowan. The two first worked together on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-cloud-announces-document-ai-platform">DocAI</a>, a team in Google Cloud that was developing A.I. technology that could analyze billions of documents.</p>
<p>They realized that they could also apply DocAI&#8217;s enterprise technology to users&#8217; personal documents, which led to the creation of Stack.</p>
<p>With the Stack app, initially available for Android, users can take a photo of a document and the app will automatically name it and &#8220;stack&#8221; it into the correct category &#8212; like Bills, Banking, House, IDs, Immigration, Insurance, Legal, Medical, Pet, Receipts, Tax, Travel, Vehicles, and Work.</p>
<p>Users can add multiple pages when scanning a document, and Stack will OCR all the pages in a document, so that the full text of the document is searchable. Users can also star their most important scans for quicker access.</p>
<p>While the ability to quickly digitize documents by photographing them isn&#8217;t new &#8212; Microsoft has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/02/microsoft-debuts-office-lens-a-document-scanning-app-for-ios-and-android/">offered Office Lens</a> for years, for example &#8212;  Stack will also be able to identify key information from within the documents, like the &#8220;due date&#8221; on a bill, the &#8220;total amount due&#8221; or &#8220;account number.&#8221; It can then pull that info out to make it easier to find later on.</p>
<p>The app additionally allows users to search through the full text of the documents, not just the title, to find information they need. To keep the items protected, Stack&#8217;s documents can be secured by either your fingerprint or face scan, similar to how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246465/google-drive-privacy-screen-face-touch-id-apple-now-available">Google Drive works</a> today. And Drive users can have all their scans automatically synced over to Google Drive.</p>
<p>Google says the app is currently available on Android, as a free download with no in-app purchases. Based on user feedback, Google will decide whether to bring Stacks to more platforms, like iOS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automaker Volkswagen wants you to know it&#8217;s serious about electric vehicles — so serious, in fact, that it&#8217;s officially rebranding around a pun in the U.S. The company revealed in a press release that it&#8217;s changing its name from &#8220;Volkswagen of America&#8221; to &#8220;Voltswagen of America&#8221; in <a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1499#images">a press release today</a>. News this could happen leaked late Monday, but many speculated it might be an April Fool&#8217;s joke that got out a bit early, but the automaker seems serious about switching the official brand from May 2021 onwards given the official release on its newsroom.</p>
<p>Voltswagen (neé Volkswagen) says that the reason behind the change is to firmly demonstrate its commitment &#8220;future-forward investment in e-mobility,&#8221; which said more simply, implies that it&#8217;s super serious about its electric drivetrain plans. In a more literal sense, &#8216;Volkswagen&#8217; is actually from the German for &#8216;the people&#8217;s car,&#8217; which suggests that Voltswagen is a car for&#8230; volts?</p>
<p>Sort of, but not really, says VW (hey that still works!):</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have said, from the beginning of our shift to an electric future, that we will build EVs for the millions, not just millionaires,&#8221; explained VW CEO and President Scott Keogh in the release announcing the swap. &#8220;This name change signifies a nod to our past as the peoples’ car and our firm belief that our future is in being the peoples’ electric car.”</p>
<p>This announcement comes just as Volkswagen has begun shipping its all-electric SUV, the ID.4, in the U.S. It ha a price tag of $33,995, before either federal and tax incentives, so that is indeed on the more affordable side of the existing U.S. electric vehicle market, with even more options set to come for cost-conscious consumers in future as the company spurs uses its commitments of lowering emissions by achieving one million global EV sales by 2025, and playing host to a lineup of mover 70 models across VW and its subrands worldwide by 2029.</p>

<p>Voltswagen branding will include use of a higher blue tone on the VW logo for all-electric vehicles, while gas cars will retain the more traditional dark blue look. The actual word &#8216;Voltswagen&#8217; will be used on EVs in addition to the initials logo, with the icon graphic itself will be the sole branding on gas cars in the U.S. going forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HighRadius</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has developed AI-powered fintech software, announced Tuesday it has raised $300 million in a Series C funding round led by D1 Capital and Tiger Global.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round values Houston-based HighRadius at $3.1 billion, triple its valuation of “more than $1 billion” at the time of its $125 million Series B in January of 2020. With this latest financing, HighRadius has raised $475 million in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers ICONIQ Growth and Susquehanna Growth Equity also participated in the round along with a slew of high-profile CEOs, including Snowflake Chairman and CEO Frank Slootman; Snowflake CFO Michael Scarpelli; Procore Technologies CEO Tooey Courtemanche and Airtable co-founder and CEO Howie Liu.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HighRadius said it will use the new capital “to fuel product innovation and expand global go-to-market reach.”</span></p>
<p>At the beginning of 2020, HighRadius had more than 400 customers, including over 200 of the Forbes Global 2000 such as Walmart, Nike and Procter &amp; Gamble, and claimed to process more than $1 trillion in transactions per year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the HighRadius platforms for Order-to-Cash and Treasury Management help more than 600 clients, including more than 200 of the Forbes Global 2000, &#8220;optimize their working capital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2006, HighRadius may not technically be a “startup” in the literal sense of the word. It has, however, notably only taken external capital in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company describes itself as a “SaaS provider for integrated receivables, such as credit, cash application, EIPP, collections, deductions, and payments.” In other words, the platform aims to automate routing receivables and payments processes  (such as predicting invoice payment dates, for example) across a variety of functions via AI and machine learning. Its white-labeled software is integrated into its partners’ offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Curtius, Partner at Tiger Global Management, said HighRadius is &#8220;in the opening innings of defining the next big software market for the Office of the CFO.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Duo, the authentication service Cisco acquired for $2.35 billion in 2018, today announced its plans to launch a passwordless authentication service that will allow users to log in to their Duo-protected services through security keys or platform biometrics like Apple&#8217;s Face ID or Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Hello. The infrastructure-agnostic service will go into public preview in [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://duo.com/">Duo</a>, the authentication service Cisco <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/16/ciscos-2-35-billion-duo-acquisition-front-and-center-at-earnings-call/">acquired for $2.35 billion in 2018</a>, today <a href="https://duo.com/blog/duos-passwordless-authentication-is-coming">announced</a> its plans to launch a <a href="https://duo.com/duo-presents-passwordless">passwordless authentication service</a> that will allow users to log in to their Duo-protected services through security keys or platform biometrics like Apple&#8217;s Face ID or Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Hello. The infrastructure-agnostic service will go into public preview in the summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cisco has strived to develop passwordless authentication that meets the needs of a diverse and evolving workforce and allows the broadest set of enterprises to securely progress towards a passwordless future, regardless of their IT stack,&#8221; said Gee Rittenhouse, SVP and GM of Cisco’s Security Business Group. &#8220;It’s not an overstatement to say that passwordless authentication will have the most meaningful global impact on how users access data by making the easiest path the most secure.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Duo or a similar product today, chances are that you are using both passwords and a second factor to log into your work applications. But users are notoriously bad about their password hygiene &#8212; and to the despair of any IT department, they also keep forgetting them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the standard two-factor authentication scheme, the second factor is basically an extra moat around your password. Passwordless is essentially another form of two-factor authentication, but it instead of passwords, it relies on cryptographic key pairs, be that with the help of a hardware security key or biometric authentication.</p>
<p>Duo&#8217;s passwordless service relies on the <a href="http://webauthn.guide/">Web Authentication standard</a> which ensures that your data is stored locally and not on a centralized server, too.</p>
<p>According to Duo&#8217;s <a href="https://duo.com/resources/ebooks/the-2020-duo-trusted-access-report">own data</a>, we have now reached a point where the hardware is ready for passwordless, with 80 percent of mobile devices now offering support for biometrics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Passwordless is a journey requiring incremental changes in users and IT environments alike, not something enterprises can enable overnight,&#8221; said Wolfgang Goerlich, Advisory Chief Information <span class="il">Security</span> Officer, <span class="il">Duo</span> <span class="il">Security</span> at Cisco. &#8220;<span class="il">Duo</span> can help enterprises transition their environments and workforces securely and minimize user friction while simultaneously increasing trust in every authentication.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in the halcyon days of 2019, we piloted a new format for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/">Extra Crunch</a> we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1/">dubbed the EC-1</a>. Modeled after the Form S-1 filing that late-stage startups submit to the SEC as part of the IPO process, EC-1s are authoritative, deep analyses into growth-stage startups. We profiled and analyzed a number of companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/patreon-ec-1/">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/">Niantic</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/roblox-ec1/">Roblox</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/09/kobalt-ec1/">Kobalt</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/how-unity-built-the-worlds-most-popular-game-engine/">Unity</a>, looking at everything from their product design, to their customer relations, to their events strategy and to the changing economics of music licensing.</p>
<p>They were very popular and we had huge ambitions for the series, but then 2020 hit, COVID-19 swept in, and suddenly our ability to travel and meet with a dozen executives in-person at a company was curtailed — there was also just a wee bit of breaking news to cover as well! We didn’t want to cut back on quality, so we bided our time.</p>
<p>Well, with some level of normality finally kicking in, we’re excited to restart this series in 2021. We have nearly 10 EC-1s in the works right now, and I am excited to introduce our first EC-1 profile of this new batch — a company that has truly skyrocketed amidst that dark pandemic year.</p>
<p><b>Tonal</b> is a unique entrant in the upscale fitness market, using a proprietary blend of hardware, software and content to bring comprehensive strength training to the home in as small and efficient of a package as possible. Sales have zoomed the past year as gyms shut down worldwide, and the company has been pelted by interest from both customers and investors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132021" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132021" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132021" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dylan_standing_incline_chest_press.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dylan_standing_incline_chest_press.png 1350w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dylan_standing_incline_chest_press.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dylan_standing_incline_chest_press.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dylan_standing_incline_chest_press.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dylan_standing_incline_chest_press.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dylan_standing_incline_chest_press.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132021" class="wp-caption-text">Tonal Device. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tonal</p></div></p>
<p>That success today, though, occludes a lengthy process of iteration over years against the droning negativity of most VCs who never expected a corporate enterprise infrastructure founder to be capable of building a popular consumer hardware device. Tonal is not just a story of willpower, but also an example of how much effort it takes to build a major startup, from product design and launch strategy to careful marketing and building the moats to protect itself from competition in a ferocious market.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s writer and analyst for this EC-1 is <b>JP Mangalindan</b>. Mangalindan has been covering technology for years now, previously serving as chief tech correspondent for our corporate sister site Yahoo Finance and also publishing across a plethora of other tech publications. He brings a wealth of insight not just into startups and Tonal, but the wider fitness market as well. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Tonal had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Mangalindan has no financial ties to Tonal or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Tonal EC-1 comprises four main articles representing about 10,600 words and a reading time of about 43 minutes. Let’s get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part 1: Origin Story</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">How a homegrown experiment became one of the fastest-growing companies in fitness tech</a>” (3,200 words/13 minutes) — We start with the history of Tonal, the multiyear effort to raise VC funds and iterate on a product while reinventing the definition of strength-training equipment.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[The company that would become Tonal had to fight through multiple VC rounds of skeptical investors ready to say that two-letter word that stops all progress.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fitness is about resistance — running against the wind, firing up muscles against the dead gravity of weights, fortifying the mind against that nagging feeling that a park bench and a scoop of ice cream would probably be just a bit more enjoyable.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			For Tonal, resistance isn’t just a value proposition, it’s the very ingredient that conditioned this startup to become one of the darlings of the fitness tech world.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.tonal.com/">Tonal</a>, resistance isn’t just a value proposition, it’s the very ingredient that conditioned this startup to become one of the darlings of the fitness tech world.</p>
<p>The numbers speak for themselves. The company has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tonal/company_financials">raised about $200 million to date</a> from venture capitalists and is becoming a household name with a $2,995 wall-mounted device that employs a digital weight system that can emulate various traditional gym stations. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/16/tonal-launches-at-home-digital-strength-training-system/">Since Tonal launched in August 2018</a>, the company has carved out a reputation among fitness enthusiasts seeking a strength-training solution at home that saves on space without compromising serious weight-lifting capabilities.</p>
<p>As at-home fitness sales have boomed during the pandemic, Tonal equipment has been one of the beneficiaries, seeing its sales surge 800% from December 2019 to December 2020. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/tonal-triples-its-physical-stores-with-nordstrom-partnership/">The company also announced a partnership with Nordstrom this month</a> which will place 50-square-foot sales stations in the women’s activewear department of at least 40 Nordstrom stores across America, bringing the total number of Tonal physical locations to 60 by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Like all great athletes though, Tonal’s visible victories belie its massive exertion against the resistance of the world to innovation. Aly Orady, the company’s founder and CEO, had to overcome his own burnout and weight gain while kindling the energy to strike his own path. The company that would become Tonal had to fight through multiple VC rounds of skeptical investors ready to say that two-letter word that stops all progress.</p>
<p>It’s that resistance and its ability to overcome barriers that makes understanding Tonal’s story so compelling.</p>
<h2>A founder lifting the weight of the past</h2>
<p>The morning after Christmas in 2013, Orady woke up feeling downright abysmal. Over the past 17 years or so, he had toiled as an engineer at companies like Samsung, Sun Microsystems, HP and three enterprise startups, work that had taken a heavy toll on him. His corporate exertions had left behind a slew of health problems; he had become grossly overweight and had developed Type II diabetes and sleep apnea.</p>
<p>“It felt like I was heading toward this point of no return, and I just wasn&#8217;t going to be able to reclaim my health if I didn&#8217;t do something about it,” he recalls.</p>
<p>The only viable path Orady saw to fixing the situation was a major lifestyle change. A few days later after the holidays, he dialed back his hours as a full-time consultant for Samsung’s TV and display division — a role that meant frequent trips to Korea — and embarked on an ambitious workout plan involving four hours of exercise a day six days a week, usually split between mornings and evening, plus intermittent fasting two days a week.</p>
<p>Many mornings, Orady woke up at 6 a.m. and drove to a Gold’s Gym in San Francisco, where he initially hit the elliptical and also went for outdoor bike rides. He scoured the internet and read books about strength training, and the more he worked out, the more he integrated strength training into his six-days-a-week workout schedule until strength training became the core of his routine. Over the course of nine months in 2014, Orady lost a whopping 70 pounds, all while winding down his consulting work with Samsung.</p>

<p>Yet, although he’d already made significant progress getting in shape — and the results truly spoke for themselves — Orady loathed trekking to the gym each day and wished he could do the same workout at home. Perched on a gym bench one day in March 2015, Orady found himself staring at a cable crossover machine, a 5 foot by 3 foot by 7 foot gym mainstay that lets users perform various exercises with removable weight plates.</p>
<p>“I was looking at this thing, and I realized the reason this thing was so big was because it relied on big metal plates and gravity to work,” he explains. “I thought to myself, if I could replace those big metal plates and gravity with electricity, I could shrink it down and create something really small.”</p>
<p>That was his cue. That same month, Orady founded Ripped Labs, a name he would later change to the simpler and catchier moniker, Tonal.</p>
<h2>The many reps of product iteration</h2>
<p>The same day Orady observed that cable crossover machine, he began brainstorming ways he could bring weight stations into the home while cutting out most of the bulk. Traditional gym stations often use large, unwieldy weight plates to offer enough resistance for strength training. But what if, Orady thought, he could devise a product that swapped out those big metal plates for something smaller and more compact and bundled that technology with intelligent software that tracked a user’s workout?</p>
<p>“I bet if we could make electromagnetics work, it would be completely revolutionary,” says Orady. “It already is the technology that spins the motors in electric cars, propels high-speed trains … but no one had ever used it for this, and the questions started swirling in my head of whether we could use electromagnetics to make a device feel like a real weight machine.” Having received a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering from McMaster University, Orady had studied the theory of electromagnetics, but he had never actually developed electromagnetic devices in his prior work.</p>
<p>Orady ordered a number of parts online to build his first prototype, a rudimentary device strapped to a wooden workbench in his home that had a cable you pulled back and forth. But those first two versions of “digital weights” didn’t work very well — there was too much friction when pulling the cables and not enough magnets to replicate a wide range of weight like traditional gym equipment. The first version contained one magnet and a usable range of 25-40 pounds, while the second prototype used dozens of magnets, which allowed the resistance to be generated by the magnets themselves and not as much from the cables.</p>
<p>After two more iterations, he had managed to create his own kind of electromagnetic technology that created resistance comparable to weights. By then, the prototype had reached a point where he felt the device replicated the feeling of doing some weight station movements like single-arm cable rows and bicep curls.</p>
<h2>A marathon of investor meetings</h2>
<p>Parallel to working on the prototype that would one day become Tonal, the Ripped Labs founder started an arduous nine-month process of pitching investors. Orady was an enterprise guy with an enterprise rolodex, having worked at three enterprise infrastructure startups and also serving as an advisor at Mayfield Fund for six months in 2013. He pitched his vision of a compact at-home strength-training product, but investors simply scoffed at the idea.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Company building, brand building, launch strategy and marketing tactics are key to the success of most startups — and that’s what this second part of the Tonal EC-1 is all about.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launching a product is a nonevent for many startups. In software, it’s not uncommon to put together a flimsy working prototype over a couple of hours and publish it immediately to start generating feedback from early users and get that iterative flywheel spinning.</p>
<p>Launching has a very different meaning, though, for hardware. Once that physical product leaves the warehouse, the design team can’t patch the hardware itself. It’s got to work reliably, be easy to use and most importantly, be safe for users straight out of the box. Even more important than readying the product itself is the sales and marketing engine that accompanies a launch. For hardware startups, a mislaunch may well lead straight to bankruptcy as hardware inventory piles up and cash flow becomes constrained. You just can’t get a launch wrong.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Getting to a point where the prototype was usable and somewhat reflected the final product in its feature set was a lengthy process.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">In part one of this EC-1</a>, we looked at the three-and-a-half years of Tonal’s origins and how a scrappy entrepreneur in the form of founder and CEO Aly Orady continued to iterate upon prototypes of an all-in-one strength-training device powered by electromagnetics — a technology he had never worked on before. We also saw how he eventually won over several investors including Bolt, Mayfield, Shasta and Sapphire Ventures, who saw the potential in his device once they experienced it for themselves.</p>
<p>Tonal’s individual components were all ready, but how should it bring them together and create a successful launch?</p>
<p>Company building, brand building, launch strategy and marketing tactics are key to the success of most startups — and that’s what this second part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">the Tonal EC-1</a> is all about. We will look at how Tonal’s designers changed the product based on feedback during its beta period. We’ll look at how Tonal’s product focus on strength training forced it to adapt a typical hardware launch strategy to optimize for the consumers it was hoping to target. Finally, we will explore the company’s marketing and launch strategy — and one key and seemingly smart decision at the time that proved to be an early blunder and humbling lesson in hindsight.</p>
<h2>Iterating when a build isn’t one click</h2>
<p>Unlike, say, productivity software where a user might be logged in for much of a work day spewing out usage data, Tonal is a strength training device, which means that users only use it for a limited period of time a couple of days per week. That made receiving sufficient authentic feedback on early units challenging.</p>
<p>Getting to a point where the prototype was usable and somewhat reflected the final product in its feature set was therefore a lengthy process. Following the small alpha trial in 2016 that Ripped Labs (later renamed Tonal) performed in a San Francisco apartment, the startup began an extensive year-long beta trial in early 2017 that placed prototype devices into 25 homes with at least two people in each home, and the company tracked those users for a year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Once a fitness tech company like Tonal launches its product, it immediately faces another challenge: how to keep those users engaged.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Once a fitness tech company like Tonal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-launch/">launches its product</a>, it immediately faces another challenge: how to keep those users engaged. It’s not enough that a customer purchased the device; it’s equally as important to keep them using it over the long term so they continue to pay the monthly subscription fees required for access to classes. In Tonal’s case, recurring revenues generated from those monthly subscription fees are significant, as the startup charges each user $49 per month with a minimum 12-month commitment to start.</p>
<p>To keep their users engaged, at-home fitness companies energize online communities by building Facebook Groups and significant Instagram and Twitter accounts. Since it launched its first bike in 2014, Peloton has catered to its large audience with a robust Facebook group that numbers nearly the population of San Francisco. Likewise, newer entrants such as Mirror and Tempo also developed their Facebook presence with nearly 86,900 and 11,200 followers, respectively.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			While it has pursued a tried-and-true community engagement strategy, Tonal has also had to evolve its tactics as it learns the unique tastes of its strength-training demographic and how they differ from other fitness users.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Tonal is no different. Across social media channels, Tonal currently has over 155,000 followers, with its own private Facebook Group, “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/officialtonalcommunity/">Official Tonal Community</a>,” having roughly 12,900 members. At this point in Tonal’s lifespan, the community experience is decent, but more along the lines of Peloton’s engagement three to four years ago.</p>
<p>Yet, while it has pursued a tried-and-true community engagement strategy, Tonal has also had to evolve its tactics as it learns the unique tastes of its strength-training demographic and how they differ from other fitness users. In this third part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">the Tonal EC-1</a>, we will look at how the company grew its nascent community, how it shifted its strategy of engaging users, how the team uses community to hone its product, and how the future of Tonal’s community will look like as the company continues its rapid ascent.</p>
<h2>A planned community, but what to build?</h2>
<p>With its online community, Tonal’s strategy was deliberate and staggered, mirroring the approach it took with its August 2018 launch, in which the startup first launched in the San Francisco Bay Area and expanded to all of California before going nationwide in March 2019.</p>
<p>The startup hired its first community manager, Sarah Johnson, in October 2017 — nearly a year before that public launch. Her initial focus was monitoring users during Tonal’s alpha and beta trials, and she regularly called users to solicit feedback about their experiences working out with the device. Among Johnson’s early observations: Unlike the gym, which inherently has a more physical social element, Tonal users, who may have partners or families, wanted their at-home classes to be the most efficient workout possible in the shortest amount of time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why should any customer spend upward of $3,000 on a Tonal device? The answer will determine Tonal’s eventual success, and that’s the theme we will explore in this fourth and final part of the EC-1.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last three sections of this EC-1, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">we’ve seen the genesis of Tonal</a>, transforming from a series of prototypes in the mind of CEO and founder Aly Orady into a unique strength-training entrant in the luxury at-home fitness market. We’ve also seen how the company extensively alpha and beta tested its device, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-launch/">designed a launch and marketing strategy</a>, and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-community/">cultivated a nascent community</a> to hone the company’s products while engaging customers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Yet, with Peloton such a dominant force in this market and multiple other fitness upstarts targeting the same affluent customer, there’s a natural question to be asked: Why should any customer ultimately spend upward of $3,000 on a base Tonal device? The answer to that question will determine Tonal’s eventual success, and that’s the theme we will explore in this fourth and final part of the EC-1 as we consider the competitive landscape of this white-hot market.</p>
<h2>So what’s the product really like?</h2>
<p>While the market is huge and the competitors are hungry, Tonal’s success pivots exclusively on whether the device itself is worth its quite prohibitive price. For me, using Tonal has been largely a positive experience, although it’s worth noting I received my Tonal loaner device within 14 days, far faster than the 10-12 week timeline that many customers have experienced in the pandemic-induced surge. The startup works with a third-party delivery service, which reminds the user the day before via email and also calls 30 minutes ahead of arrival.</p>

Photo via Tonal.</p></div></p>
<p>Compact as the Tonal device is compared to gym weight stations, it was still a squeeze finding a spot in my crowded 900-square-foot apartment, and using it still requires me to move some dining chairs around to make space for my workout. While this probably won’t be an issue for many Tonal owners who live in larger homes (particularly in the suburbs), I suspect city dwellers may encounter similar challenges as I did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cameo, the celebrity video site you’re probably familiar with if you’ve celebrated a birthday in the last three years, <a href="https://cameoblog.medium.com/fueling-the-future-of-the-connection-economy-165556a860cc">announced this morning</a> that it’s raised a $100M Series C. The round, which was led by Jonathan Turner with e.ventures, puts the site’s value at just north of $1 billion.</p>
<p>Cameo has been building a good deal of steam in recent years, but the service is among those that managed to get a major boost amid the pandemic, as celebrities and normals alike suddenly found themselves with a lot more time on their hands.</p>
<p>“The pandemic put extra stress on the already unstable business models supporting talent across sports and entertainment ecosystems,&#8221; CEO Steven Galanis said in a Medium post tied to the news. &#8220;It catalyzed a massive shift in awareness and widespread adoption of direct-to-fan models, which has, in turn, created a new foundation for fan engagement. We exist in an entirely different world today — one in which talent actually want to connect more deeply with their fans, and fans expect unprecedented access to the talent they admire most. This funding will help us create the access and connections that will define the future of the ‘connection economy’ on a global scale.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest round more than doubles the service’s total funding, bringing it up to $165 million. Google Ventures, Amazon Alexa Fund, UTA, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Valor Equity Partners and Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley) join existing investors, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins, The Chernin Group, Origin Venture and Spark Capital. There are also some “talent investors” on board, as well, including skateboarding legend, Tony Hawk. Because, you know, Cameo.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fq6UX9YE2U0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Cameo says some 80% of its standard video requests are booked as gifts, to celebrate things like birthdays. In total, around two million videos have been created through the offering. But the site is looking to grow into additional categories. Last year it added the ability to book celebrities as guests for Zoom video chats (a very pandemic-focused offering).</p>
<p>Some of the funding will go toward ramping up <a href="https://biz.cameo.com/">Cameo for Business (C4B)</a>, which brings celebrity videos to events and conferences, as well as ads and sales. Effectively, the service works as a pipeline between businesses and famous people. The company will also be expending its international offering, growing beyond the approximately 20% of videos currently purchased outside the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is set to make a change to its Crew Dragon spacecraft for its forthcoming history-making all-civilian launch, currently set for September 15. That Dragon will replace its International Space Station docking mechanism with a transparent dome, through which passengers will be able to take in an awe-inspiring surround panorama of space and the Earth from an orbital perspective.</p>
<p>The glass dome will be at the &#8216;nose&#8217; of the Dragon capsule, or its topmost point when it&#8217;s loaded upright on top of a Falcon 9 rocket readying for launch. There should be space for one passenger to use it at a time, and it&#8217;ll be opened up once the spacecraft is safely out of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, exposed by a protective cover that can be flipped back down to protect the observation deck when the spacecraft re-enters on its return trip.</p>
<p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called it &#8220;the most &#8216;in space&#8217; you could possibly feel&#8221; in a tweet sharing a concept render of the new modification in use. During a press briefing for the upcoming tourist flight, which is called &#8216;Inspiration4&#8217; and led by billionaire Jared Isaacman, it was described as being similar to the exiting cupola on the International Space Station in terms of the views it affords.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The ISS cupola is an observatory module built by the European Space Agency (ESA) and installed in 2010. Based on these renders from SpaceX, the Dragon version will be a continuous unbroken transparent surface, whereas the ISS cupola is made up of segmented panes separated by support structure, so that could mean Dragon provides a better view.</p>

<p>This modification could pave the way for a more permanent alternate configuration of Dragon, one best-suited for SpaceX&#8217;s planned commercial passenger missions, most of which will likely aim to do orbital tours without any actual docking at the ISS. It&#8217;s possible the company will make further cabin modifications when the vehicle isn&#8217;t configured for crew delivery to the orbital science station.</p>
<p>SpaceX also revealed new details about the Inspiration4 mission today, including its planned launch date of September 15, and a three-day mission flight duration. The r<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission/">emaining two passengers on board the four-person crew were also revealed this morning</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://stockly.ai">Stockly</a>, a French startup that keeps the inventory of various e-commerce websites in sync. When you see an out-of-stock item on an e-commerce website, chances are you leave that website and try to find the same item on another site.</p>
<p>If you operate an e-commerce website, Stockly lets you sell items even when they’re currently out of stock. The startup automatically finds a third-party Stockly supplier with that specific item.</p>
<p>The order will go through and be sent by that supplier directly. Stockly tells its partners to use neutral packaging so that the end consumer isn’t confused.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This could be particularly useful for small scale e-commerce companies that don’t have a healthy marketplace of third-party retailers. For instance, Amazon can already sell you an out-of-stock item if a supplier has listed that specific item on Amazon’s own marketplace. But that’s not the case for most e-commerce websites.</p>
<p>The main challenge for Stockly is that it has to sort through various catalog formats and match the different inventories of different retailers. It is focusing on clothing items at first. When an order is routed through Stockly, it selects a specific supplier based on different criteria, such as logistics, delivery time and historical data.</p>
<p>So far, Stockly has been working with Galeries Lafayette, Go Sport, Foot Shop and others. The startup has recently raised a $6 million (€5.1 million) funding round from <a href="https://www.idinvest.com">Idinvest Partners</a>, <a href="https://daphni.com">Daphni</a>, <a href="https://www.techstars.com">Techstars</a>, Checkout.com CEO Guillaume Pousaz and various business angels.</p>
<p>With this funding round, the company plans to expand its team to 20 people, add new clients and iterate on its product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The autonomous vehicle startup Aurora Innovation said Tuesday it has reached an agreement with Volvo to jointly develop autonomous semi trucks for North America.</p>
<p>The partnership, which the two companies say will span several years and is through Volvo&#8217;s Autonomous Solutions unit, will focus on trucks built to operate autonomously on highways between hubs for Volvo customers. The Aurora Driver technology stack – Aurora’s self-driving software, computer and sensor suite – will be integrated into Volvo trucks.</p>
<p>The announcement comes fresh on the heels of the startup’s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">acquisition of Uber’s self-driving subsidiary</a> and a separate deal with Toyota to develop self-driving minivans. Aurora now has partnerships with two of the three largest trucking manufacturers – Paccar and Volvo – that produce and sell nearly 50% of all Class 8 trucks in the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our previously announced collaborations with partners such as PACCAR will continue in parallel to the collaboration with Volvo,” an Aurora spokesperson told TechCrunch. “As Paccar’s first self-driving technology partner, the unique nature of our partnership enables us to build Paccar’s first redundant truck that will be able to operate without a safety driver, bring it to market first, and deploy it broadly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aurora said its Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave lidar  — through its acquisitions of companies Blackmore and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/aurora-acquires-a-second-lidar-company-in-push-to-bring-self-driving-trucks-to-the-road/">OURS Technology</a> — will be key to solving autonomous long-range trucking. Lidar, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/12/wtf-is-lidar/">light detection and ranging radar</a>, is considered to be a necessary component of self-driving systems. Aurora&#8217;s pitch&#8217;s is that unlike traditional time-of-flight lidar, its technology provides the long-range visibility needed to be able to spot hazards with enough time to stop or slow down.</p>
<p>The announcement also marks a major acceleration for Volvo&#8217;s autonomous vehicle arm, Volvo Autonomous Solutions. It&#8217;s the business unit&#8217;s first deal to bring autonomous trucking to the road.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2017, Aurora has rapidly become one of the leaders in self-driving tech, attracting backing from Amazon, Sequoia Capital and Greylock Partners. The company was founded by former executives of Uber, Tesla and Google.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, a site on the dark web claimed it had 8.2 terabytes of MobiKwik user data. The data included phone numbers, email addresses, scrambled passwords, transactions logs, and partial payment card numbers.</p>
<p>The website also claimed that it had &#8220;know your customer&#8221; (KYA) documents (government-issued Aadhaar card or PAN ID) of 3.5 million users, and each visit to the website displayed four random images from the data dump. KYC documents are required in India for users who want to access certain services without any limitations. Local law requires a mobile wallet firm in India, for instance, to support monthly transactions exceeding a certain limit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The dark web site features a searchable database that allows users to look up their phone number or email to verify the authenticity of the data breach claim. TechCrunch was able to verify the accuracy of the data in several cases.</p>
<p>A seller on a well-known cybercrime forum claims to be selling access to the database for 1.2 bitcoin — about $70,000.</p>
<p>The Sequoia Capital India-backed startup says it can&#8217;t yet prove if the data actually belongs to MobiKwik users. “It is incorrect to suggest that the data available on the darkweb has been accessed from MobiKwik or any identified source,” the startup <a href="https://blog.mobikwik.com/message-from-the-company/">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Rajshekhar Rajaharia, a security researcher, told TechCrunch that he alerted MobiKwik about this alleged security breach last month. In a statement, MobiKwik said the company had conducted a thorough investigation and did not find any evidence of a breach.</p>
<p>However, a screenshot leaked to TechCrunch shows a MobiKwik official asking an Amazon representative last month for logs relating to its cloud service after the startup &#8220;came to know that our S3 [cloud storage] data is downloaded by some other person outside the organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup said its legal team will take “strict action against the so-called security researcher.” Rajaharia told TechCrunch that it’s his right as a user to know if his financial data is safe and that he doesn’t have the resources to fight legal battles.</p>
<p>MobiKwik said it was closely working with authorities and was confident that security protocols to store sensitive data are “robust and have not been breached.” It added that it was getting a third-party to conduct a forensic data security audit. &#8220;We are committed to a safe and secure Digital India.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.capitolis.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitolis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which makes technology for capital markets players such as investment and merchant banks, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has closed on a $90 million Series C funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing included participation from existing backers Index Ventures, Sequoia Capital, S Capital, Spark Capital, SVB Capital, Citi, J.P. Morgan and State Street and brings Capitolis’ total funding to date to $170 million. SVB Capital and Spark Capital co-led a $40 million Series B for the company in November 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitolis CEO and founder Gil Mandelzis said the startup&#8217;s mission since its 2017 inception has been to “fundamentally re-imagine how the capital markets operate&#8221;</span> after the last financial crisis and the &#8220;bold steps taken by regulators&#8221; in its aftermath.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company says that its <span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced workflow technology and proprietary algorithms</span> allows banks, hedge funds and asset managers to eliminate, move or create trading positions by collaborating with other financial institutions. <span style="font-weight: 400;">That results in freed up capital, open credit lines and access to capital from a bigger pool of sources, the company claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Capitolis&#8217; network software is designed to help financial institutions optimize their balance sheets and reduce risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-five financial institutions currently use the Capitolis platform. The company says it grew its revenue run rate by &#8220;sixfold&#8221; in 2020. Since 2019, Capitolis has experienced a 230% increase in the number of users of its platform. To date, the startup says it has optimized $9 trillion in terms of gross notional balances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Rampell, partner at a16z, said that his firm believes that what sets Capitolis apart from other financial services players “is the sheer scale of management’s ambition and the substantial talent, technology and capital milestones they have achieved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York-based company says it plans to use its new capital toward product development and to boost its customer support and sales staff. It plans to increase its headcount from 90 today to over 150 by year’s end.</span></p>
<p>Capitolis currently covers foreign exchange products and equity swaps. It says it could expand into others if there is client demand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Self-driving and robotics startup Cartken has partnered with REEF Technology, a startup that operates parking lots and neighborhood hubs, to bring self-driving delivery robots to the streets of downtown Miami.</p>
<p>With this announcement, Cartken officially comes out of stealth mode. The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/the-engineers-behind-googles-bookbot-have-launched-a-delivery-robot-startup/">founded by ex-Google engineers and colleagues behind the unrequited Bookbot</a>, was formed to develop market-ready tech in self-driving, AI-powered robotics and delivery operations in 2019, but the team has kept operations under wraps until now. This is Cartken&#8217;s first large deployment of self-driving robots on sidewalks.</p>
<p>After a few test months, the REEF-branded electric-powered robots are now delivering dinner orders from REEF&#8217;s network of delivery-only kitchens to people located within a 3/4-mile radius in downtown Miami. The robots, which are insulated and thus can preserve the heat of a plate of spaghetti or other hot food, are pre-stationed at designated logistics hubs and dispatched with orders for delivery as the food is prepared.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to show how future-forward Miami can be,&#8221; Matt Lindenberger, REEF&#8217;s chief technology officer, told TechCrunch. &#8220;This is a great chance to show off the capabilities of the tech. The combination of us having a big presence in Miami, the fact that there are a lot of challenges around congestion as Covid subsides, still shows a really good environment where we can show how this tech can work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lindenberg said Miami is a great place to start, but it&#8217;s just the beginning, with potential for the Cartken robots to be used for REEF&#8217;s other last-mile delivery businesses. Currently, only two restaurant delivery robots are operating in Miami, but Lindenberger said the company is planning to expand further into the city and outward into Fort Lauderdale, as well as other large metros the company operates in, such as Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles and eventually New York.</p>
<p>Lindenberger is hoping the presence of robots in the streets can act as a &#8220;force multiplier&#8221; allowing them to scale while maintaining quality of service in a cost-effective way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing an explosion in deliveries right now in a post-pandemic world and we foresee that to continue, so these types of no-contact, zero-emission automation techniques are really critical,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Starship Technologies CEO Lex Bayer on focus and opportunity in autonomous delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starship-technologies-ceo-lex-bayer-on-focus-and-opportunity-in-autonomous-delivery/embed/#?secret=TqGiLbVMaq" data-secret="TqGiLbVMaq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Cartken&#8217;s robots are powered by a combination of machine learning and rules-based programming to react to every situation that could occur, even if that just means safely stopping and asking for help, Christian Bersch, CEO of Cartken, told TechCrunch. REEF would have supervisors on site to remotely control the robot if needed, a caveat that was included in the<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/1027/BillText/er/PDF"> 2017 legislation that allowed for the operation of self-driving delivery robots in Florida</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The technology at the end of the day is very similar to that of a self-driving car,&#8221; said Bersch. &#8220;The robot is seeing the environment, planning around obstacles like pedestrians or lampposts. If there&#8217;s an unknown situation, someone can help the robot out safely because it can stop on a dime. But it&#8217;s important to also have that level of autonomy on the robot because it can react in a split second, faster than anybody remotely could, if something happens like someone jumps in front of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>REEF marks specific operating areas on the map for the robots and Cartken tweaks the configuration for the city, accounting for specific situations a robot might need to deal with, so that when the robots are given a delivery address, they can make moves and operate like any other delivery driver. Only this driver has an LTE connection and is constantly updating its location so REEF can integrate it into its fleet management capabilities.</p>

<p>Eventually, Lindenberger said, they&#8217;re hoping to be able to offer the option for customers to choose robot delivery on the major food delivery platforms REEF works with like P<span style="font-weight: 400;">ostmates, UberEats, DoorDash or GrubHub. Customers would receive a text when the robot arrives so they could go outside and meet it. However, the tech is not quite there yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently the robots only make it street-level, and then the food is passed off to a human who delivers it directly to the door, which is a service that most customers prefer. Navigating into an apartment complex and to a customer&#8217;s unit is difficult for a robot to manage just yet, and many customers aren&#8217;t quite ready to interact directly with a robot. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an interim step, but this was a path for us to move forward quickly with the technology without having any other boundaries,&#8221; said Lindenberger. &#8220;Like with any new tech, you want to take it in steps. So a super important step which we&#8217;ve now taken and works very well is the ability to dispatch robots within a certain radius and know that they&#8217;re going to arrive there. That in and of itself is a huge step and it allows us to learn what kind of challenges you have in terms of that very last step. Then we can begin to work with Cartken to solve that last piece. It&#8217;s a big step just being able to do this automation.&#8221;</p>
