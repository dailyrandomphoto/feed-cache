										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The big media consolidation continues &#8212; day after rumors swirled around Amazon’s acquisition of MGM, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210526005648/en/Amazon-and-MGM-have-signed-an-agreement-for-Amazon-to-acquire-MGM/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-SixzGpg-aPrNklZ4nvkcE4TY94BwQxjampCy0ugQmZbnkvYMqDDYxFrLs-oQ2BHQ0lNV9vE3ogUB8lg9me5DJ5HOIe_ZSOSL3m4JhK3aYyB9HNxCGXiDSWsXl5s-JshAwUr0fO6FA4Gx3o4ssEAaW4=">the online massive retailer confirmed today</a> that it will be acquiring the nearly 100-year-old studio for a cool $8.45 billion.</p>
<p>The deal is another big step toward bolster Amazon’s fight in the streaming wars, with some 4,000 films. The list includes the James Bond and Rocky series and classics ranging from Fargo to Robocop to Silence of the Lambs. Also included are more than 17,000 TV shows. Once the deal closes, the short term impact will be unfettered access for Amazon&#8217;s Prime Video platform, giving the service a leg up against rivals like Netflix, Hulu and HBO Max.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen with the launch of studio streaming platforms like Disney+, the deal will also likely result in that content being pulled from competing services, once existing contracts end. “The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team,” Amazon Studios/Prime Video SVP Mike Hopkins said in a release. “It’s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon also says it will be making efforts to preserve older films. The press material includes all of the standard language you would expect about marrying the old with the new. Here&#8217;s MGM Board Chairman, Kevin Ulrich, “I am very proud that MGM’s Lion, which has long evoked the Golden Age of Hollywood, will continue its storied history, and the idea born from the creation of United Artists lives on in a way the founders originally intended, driven by the talent and their vision. The opportunity to align MGM’s storied history with Amazon is an inspiring combination.”</p>
<p>Amazon has, of course, already been making an aggressive push into original content through its own production studio and distribution. On the film side, it has produced notable titles like Manchester By the Sea, which nabbed a screenwriting Oscar and its list of shows includes Transparent. The company is also embarking on a massive (and massively expensive) series based on Lord of Rings.</p>
<p>As ever with these massive deals, the acquisition is pending all sorts of regulator scrutiny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook this week <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/giving-people-more-control/">will begin to</a> publicly roll out the option to hide Likes on posts across both Facebook and Instagram, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/instagram-private-like-counts/">earlier tests</a> beginning in 2019. The project, which puts the decision about Likes in the hands of the company&#8217;s global user base, had been in development for years, but was deprioritized due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the response work required on Facebook&#8217;s part, the company says.</p>
<p>Originally, the idea to hide Like counts on Facebook&#8217;s social networks was focused on depressurizing the experience for users. Often, users faced anxiety and embarrassment around their posts if they didn&#8217;t receive enough Likes to be considered &#8220;popular.&#8221; This problem was particularly difficult for younger users who highly value what peers think of them &#8212; so much so that they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teens-curate-their-instagram-accounts-2016-5">would take down posts</a> that didn&#8217;t receive enough Likes.</p>
<p>Like-chasing on Instagram, especially, also helped create an environment where people posted to gain clout and notoriety, which can be a less authentic experience. On Facebook, gaining Likes or other forms of engagement could also be associated with posting polarizing content that required a reaction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result of this pressure to perform, some users grew hungry for a &#8220;Like-free&#8221; safer space, where they could engage with friends or the wider public without trying to earn these popularity points. That, in turn, gave rise to a new crop of social networking and photo-sharing apps such as <a href="https://www.minutiae-app.org/">Minutiae</a>, <a href="https://vero.co/">Vero</a>, <a href="https://www.dayflashapp.com/">Dayflash</a>, <a href="http://hipstamatic.com/oggl/">Oggl</a> and, now, newcomers like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/"> Dispo</a> and newly viral <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/what-is-poparazzi-app">Poparazzi</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spark Capital decides to &#8216;sever all ties&#8217; with David Dobrik’s Dispo app weeks after leading deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/embed/#?secret=HEbakj9mzL" data-secret="HEbakj9mzL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though Facebook and Instagram could have chosen to remove Likes entirely and take its social networks in a new direction, the company soon found that the metric was too deeply integrated into the product experience to be fully removed. One key issue was how the influencer community today trades on Likes as a form of currency that allows them to exchange their online popularity for brand deals and job opportunities. Removing Likes, then, is not necessarily an option for these users.</p>
<p>Instagram realized that if it made a decision for its users, it would anger one side or the other &#8212; even if the move in either direction didn&#8217;t really impact other core metrics, like app usage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157105" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157105" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2157105" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="432" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png 1700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=1536,976 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Consumer-View.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157105" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;How many likes [users] got, or other people got &#8212; it turned out that it didn&#8217;t actually change nearly as much about the experience, in terms of how people felt or how much they use experience, as we thought it would. But it did end up being pretty polarizing,&#8221; admitted Instagram head, Adam Mosseri. &#8220;Some people really liked it and some people really didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For those who liked it, it was mostly what we had hoped &#8212; which is that it depressurized the experience. And, for those who didn&#8217;t, they used Likes to get a sense for what was trending or was relevant on Instagram and on Facebook. And they were just super annoyed that we took it away,&#8221; he added. This latter group sometimes included smaller creators still working on establishing a presence across social media, though larger influencers were sometimes in favor of Like removals. (Mosseri name-checked Katy Perry as being pro Like removals, in fact.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MIT professor wants to overhaul &#8216;The Hype Machine&#8217; that powers social media&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/embed/#?secret=bquMKEu59m" data-secret="bquMKEu59m" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ultimately, the company decided to split the difference. Instead of making a hard choice about the future of its online communities, it&#8217;s rolling out the &#8220;no Likes&#8221; option as a user-controlled setting on both platforms.</p>
<p>On Instagram, both content consumers and content producers can turn on or off Like and View counts on posts &#8212; which means you can choose to not see these metrics when scrolling your own Feed and you can choose whether to allow Likes to be viewed by others when you&#8217;re posting. These are configured as two different settings, which provides for more flexibility and control.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157104" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157104" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2157104" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Producer-View.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="432" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Producer-View.png 1700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Producer-View.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Producer-View.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Producer-View.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Producer-View.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Producer-View.png?resize=1536,976 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IG-Hiding-Likes-Producer-View.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157104" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>On Facebook, meanwhile, users access the new setting from the &#8220;Settings &amp; Privacy&#8221; area under News Feed Settings (or News Feed Preferences on desktop). From here, you&#8217;ll find an option to &#8220;Hide number of reactions&#8221; to turn this setting off for both your own posts and for posts from others in News Feed, groups and Pages.</p>
<p>The feature will be made available to both public and private profiles, Facebook tells us, and will include posts you&#8217;ve published previously.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157366" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157366" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2157366" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_ReactionPreferences.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_ReactionPreferences.jpg 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_ReactionPreferences.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_ReactionPreferences.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_ReactionPreferences.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_ReactionPreferences.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157366" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Instagram<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow/"> last month restarted its tests on this feature</a> in order to work out any final bugs before making the new settings live for global users, and said a Facebook test would come soon. But it&#8217;s now forging ahead with making the feature available publicly. When asked why such a short test, Instagram told TechCrunch it had been testing various iterations on this experience since 2019, so it felt it had enough data to proceed with a global launch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QrYAIWPmxI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow/">Instagram&#8217;s new test lets you choose if you want to hide &#8216;Likes,&#8217; Facebook test to follow</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Instagram&#8217;s new test lets you choose if you want to hide &#8216;Likes,&#8217; Facebook test to follow&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/instagrams-new-test-lets-you-choose-if-you-want-to-hide-likes-facebook-test-to-follow/embed/#?secret=QrYAIWPmxI" data-secret="QrYAIWPmxI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mosseri also pushed back at the idea that a decision on Likes would have majorly impacted the network. While removal of Likes on Instagram had some impact on user behavior, he said, it was not enough to be concerning. In some groups, users posted more &#8212; signaling that they felt less pressure to perform, perhaps. But others engaged less, Mosseri said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157367" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157367" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2157367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FacebookApp_Reactions_News-Feed.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Often people say, &#8216;oh, this has a bunch of Likes. I&#8217;m gonna go check it out,&#8217; &#8221; the exec explained. &#8220;Then they read the comments, or go deeper, or swipe to the carousel. There&#8217;s been some small effects &#8212; some positive, some negative &#8212; but they&#8217;ve all been small,&#8221; he noted. Instagram also believes users may toggle on and off the feature at various times, based on how they&#8217;re feeling.</p>
<p>In addition, Mosseri pointed out, &#8220;there&#8217;s no rigorous research that suggests Likes are bad for people&#8217;s well-being&#8221; &#8212; a statement that pushes back over the growing concerns that a gamified social media space is bad for users&#8217; mental health. Instead, he argued that Instagram is still a small part of people&#8217;s day, so how Likes function doesn&#8217;t affect people&#8217;s overall well-being.</p>
<p>&#8220;As big as we are, we have to be careful not to overestimate our influence,&#8221; Mosseri said.</p>
<p>He also dismissed some of the current research pointing to negative impacts of social media use as being overly reliant on methodologies that ask users to self-report their use, rather than measure it directly.</p>
<p>In other words, this is not a company that feels motivated to remove Likes entirely due to the negative mental health outcomes attributed to its popularity metrics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning that another factor that could have come into play here is Instagram&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/facebook-instagram-for-kids-state-attorneys-general-letter/">plan to make a version of its app available to children under the age of 13,</a> as competitor TikTok did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">following its FTC settlement</a>. In that case, hiding Likes by default &#8212; or perhaps adding a parental control option &#8212; would necessitate such a setting. Instagram tells TechCrunch that, while it&#8217;s too soon to know what it would do with a kids app, it will &#8220;definitely explore&#8221; a no Likes by default option.</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram both told TechCrunch the feature will roll out starting on Wednesday but will reach global users over time. On Instagram, that may take a matter of days.</p>
<p>Facebook, meanwhile, says a small percentage of users will have the feature Wednesday &#8212; notified through an alert on News Feed &#8212; but it will reach Facebook&#8217;s global audience &#8220;over the next few weeks.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lightrun.com/">Lightrun</a>, a startup that helps developers debug their live production code, today announced that it has raised a $23 million Series A round led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>. <a href="https://glilotcapital.com/">Glilot Capital Partners</a>, which led the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/lightrun-raises-4m-for-its-continuous-debugging-and-observability-platform/">$4 million seed round</a>, also participated in this round.</p>
<p>What makes Lightrun stand out in a sea of monitoring startups is its focus on developers (more so than IT teams) and its ability to help developers debug their production code right from their IDEs. With a few keystrokes, they can also instrument the code for monitoring, but the key here is that Lightrun offers what the company calls an &#8220;ops-free&#8221; process that puts the developers in control. This &#8220;shift-left&#8221; approach moves the application monitoring process away from ops-centric tools like Splunk and New Relic and instead puts them right into the workspaces with which developers are already familiar.</p>
<p>&#8220;The observability market has been very oriented towards IT operators. When an IT operator gets that dreaded page that a service is down, they see health metrics on running instances on servers and have a variety of failover methods and ways to restore service health,&#8221; Lightrun co-founder and CEO Ilan Peleg explained. &#8220;And they do this all natively on the same interfaces that they use every day for systems management. But when a developer gets that dreaded notification that there is a bug, it’s like the early stages of a crime scene investigation that has no suspects and usually only minor clues.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yLL1A4Q-Hn0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Currently, the service only supports Java and the IntelliJ development environment, but the team plans to expand its language and platform coverage by adding support for Python and Node.js, as well as additional IDEs.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a number of observability solutions joining the market, but found Lightrun’s shift-left approach to be truly unique,” said Teddie Wardi, managing director, Insight Partners, who led the round and will join the board of directors. “The main point of shifting observability to the left in the software development lifecycle is incorporating observability into the day-to-day developer workflow. Lightrun makes observability more ops-free, real-time and ergonomic to the development process than any other platform, and we believe they are in a position to capture a large international market of development teams at enterprises that prioritize rapid feature development and frequent shipping.”</p>
<p>The company recently launched a free community edition of its service and introduced a set of new integrations with services like Datadog, IntelliJ IDEA, Logz.io, Prometheus, Slack and StatsD. Some of Lightrun&#8217;s current customers include Taboola, Sisense and Tufin.</p>
<p>The company doubled its employee count over the course of the last year. It will continue to use the new funding to expand its developer community and hire across functions. The company also plans to expand its U.S. presence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another sizable raise for a pet (cats and dogs) tracking company this morning. Austria-based Tractive has announced a $35 million Series A, led by Guidepost Growth Equity. The round is the company’s first since 2013, when its GPS-based tracker first hit the market.</p>
<p>Along with the funding round, the company is also announcing its official push into the U.S. market &#8212; though Tractive has had some presence here through a “soft launch” of an LTE tracker over the summer. That product apparently made the States its fastest growing market, in spite of a lack of official presence.</p>
<p>The funding will go toward its expansion into the U.S./North American market, along with additional scaling and headcount. For the latter, the company is already naming a new EVP of North America and a VP of marketing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Tractive is like a seatbelt for your dog or cat. It provides coverage when and where they need it,” said co-founder and CEO Michael Hurnaus in a release. “We designed Tractive to deliver the best possible experience, with up-to-the-second information, so that all pet parents can care for their dogs and cats the way they want and deserve &#8212; whether that means monitoring activity levels to reduce the risk of obesity or tracking a dog or cat that slipped out of the yard.”</p>
<p>Also new is the arrival of an upgraded tracker from the company, primarily focused on improved battery life. The big change is the use of Wi-Fi to reduce battery strain when a pet is in the home. The company says it&#8217;s able to bump up battery life up to 5x. The tracker is available for $50 in the U.S., plus a monthly subscription fee.</p>
<p>In February, smart pet collar maker Fi announced a $30 million Series B.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Imagine if Google Docs was end-to-end encrypted so that not even Google could access your documents. That&#8217;s <a href="https://skiff.org/">Skiff</a>, in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Skiff is a document editor with a similar look and feel to Google Docs, allowing you to write, edit and collaborate in real-time with colleagues with privacy baked in. Because the document editor is built on a foundation of end-to-end encryption, Skiff doesn&#8217;t have access to anyone&#8217;s documents — only users, and those who are invited to collaborate, do.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an idea that has already attracted the attention of investors. Skiff&#8217;s co-founders Andrew Milich (CEO) and Jason Ginsberg (CTO) announced today that the startup has raised $3.7 million in seed funding from venture firm Sequoia Capital, just over a year since Skiff was founded in March 2020. Alphabet chairman John Hennessy, former Yahoo chief executive Jerry Yang, and Eventbrite co-founders Julia and Kevin Hartz also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Milich and Ginsberg told TechCrunch that the company will use the seed funding to grow the team and build out the platform.</p>
<p>Skiff isn&#8217;t that much different from WhatsApp or Signal, which are also end-to-end encrypted, underneath its document editor. &#8220;Instead of using it to send messages to a bunch of people, we&#8217;re using it to send little pieces of documents and then piecing those together into a collaborative workspace,&#8221; said Milich.</p>
<p>But the co-founders acknowledged that putting your sensitive documents in the cloud requires users to put a lot of trust into the startup, particularly one that hasn&#8217;t been around for long. That&#8217;s why Skiff <a href="https://www.skiff.org/security">published a whitepaper</a> with technical details of how its technology works, and has <a href="https://www.skiff.org/updates/skiff-is-open-sourcing">begun to open source</a> parts of its code, allowing anyone to see how the platform works. Milich said Skiff has also gone through at least one comprehensive security audit, and the company counts advisors from the Signal Foundation to Trail of Bits.</p>
<p>It seems to be working. In the months since Skiff soft-launched through an invite-only program, thousands of users — including journalists, research scientists and human rights lawyers — use Skiff every day, with another 8,000 users on a waitlist.</p>
<p>&#8220;The group of users that we&#8217;re most excited about are just regular people that care about privacy,&#8221; said Ginsberg. &#8220;There are just so many privacy communities and people that are advocates for these types of products that really care about how they&#8217;re built and have sort of lost trust in big companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re using us because they&#8217;re really excited about the vision and the future of end-to-end encryption,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.obierisk.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has developed an insurtech platform for landlords, has raised $10.7 million in a Series A funding round led by Battery Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomvest Ventures, Funders Club, MetaProp and Second Century Ventures also participated in the financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this sounds like a niche offering, that’s because it is. Obie’s software specifically targets small-to-medium size apartment landlords who own single-family rentals and/or larger apartment buildings.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago-based Obie &#8212; which also went through the Y Combinator program &#8212; says its platform stands out because it offers instant quotes (by instant, they mean in about three to five minutes). The company also claims to save policyholders up to 25-30% compared to other insurance premiums. Over the past year, Obie has secured insurance for over $3 billion worth of property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obie co-founders (and brothers) Aaron and Ryan Letzeiser have taken their respective backgrounds in insurance and real estate private equity to build out the Obie platform. They are operating under the premise that despite being the largest class of real estate investors in the U.S, this group of landlords “is significantly underserved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Generally SMB landlords have been ignored in the market, and there&#8217;s 11 million of them,” Aaron said. “And we beat target premiums, on average, by 31.7%.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand appears to be there. According to the pair, Obie saw its premiums climb to about $1 million in its first 12 months of being in business. Over the last 12 months, that number has climbed to about $10 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with its funding announcement, Obie also announced today the extension of its property and casualty insurance to all 50 states.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157275" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157275" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2157275 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/yc1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157275" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Obie</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how does it work? Landlords and investors answer a series of questions on Obie’s site. The platform extracts a few data points from client responses, which its technology then combines with public and private data points such as the proximity of the landlord to the property. (This can be an indicator of how quickly a landlord can conduct proactive and preventative maintenance and general attentiveness to tenant issues.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Obie runs its analysis, the platform uses a “proprietary” algorithm to match an application to carriers based on what they describe as “risk-appetite” profiles. For example, some carriers don’t want to cover properties built before a certain year. The platform then provides the landlords and property owners with a quote. If they’re OK with the quote, landlords can be “immediately underwritten,” according to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its core, said Ryan, the brothers want to make Obie “the easiest way for landlords to get the insurance that they need.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to expand upon its product and “really try to own the entire vertical.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Historically, we&#8217;ve been an agency-based business but we are in the process of putting together our own product that is slated to roll out right at the end of the second quarter,” said Aaron. “Very similar to Lemonade and Hippo, and we’re doing it with a large insurer that’s backing us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Obie believes it has validated its brokerage model in the market and is now planning to use the data it’s been able to gather to become its own carrier. The company expects the rollout to take time, so until it gets approval in all 50 states, it will partner with other carriers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal at the end of the day is to go from agency to eventually carrier,” said Ryan. “This is a tried and true path. Next has done it. Hippo has done it. Lemonade has done it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brothers believe their backgrounds allow them “to speak the same language” to their clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have lived the pain points of our clients so we can understand how the price of the premium of coverage experience plays into the overall business strategy,” Aaron said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Battery Ventures’ Michael Brown, who has taken a seat on Obie’s board, agrees the embedded nature of the startup’s offering gives them a competitive advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Allowing their end customers to buy professional liability or general liability or commercial auto right from the vertical software that is servicing their business is really interesting and a great distribution channel for Obie,” Brown told TechCrunch. “Landlords can go direct or through their channel partners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown says Battery &#8212; as long-term investors in the insurance sector &#8212; was also attracted to the fact that Obie is focused on commercial lines rather than personal because the firm believes “they are larger markets, less competitive and can probably drive higher value just given the overall size of the premiums involved.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.uptycs.com/">Uptycs</a>, a Boston-area startup that uses data to help understand and prevent security attacks, announced a $50 million Series C today, 11 months after announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/uptycs-lands-30m-series-b-to-keep-building-security-analytics-platform/">a $30 million Series B</a>. Norwest Venture Partners led the round with participation from Sapphire Ventures and ServiceNow Ventures.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Ganesh Pai says that he was still well capitalized from last year&#8217;s investment, and wasn&#8217;t actually looking to raise funds, but the investors came looking for him and he saw a way to speed up some aspects of the company&#8217;s roadmap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was one of those things where the round came in primarily as a function of execution and success to date, and we decided to capitalize on that because we know the partners and raised the capital so that we could use it meaningfully for a couple of different things, primarily sales and marketing acceleration,&#8221; Pai said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that part of the reason for the company&#8217;s success over the last year was that the pandemic generated more customer interest as people moved to work from home, the SolarWinds hack happened and companies were moving to the cloud faster. &#8220;We provided a solution which was telemetric powered and very insightful when it came to solving their security problems and that&#8217;s what led to triple digit growth over the last year,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2020 was a disaster, but the pandemic put security in the spotlight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight/embed/#?secret=xjgDPnj5j2" data-secret="xjgDPnj5j2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Pai says that the company has not been sitting still in terms of the platform. While last year, he described it primarily as a forensic security data solution, helping customers figure out what happened after a security issue has happened, he says that the company has begun expanding on that vision to include all four main areas of security including being proactive, reactive, predictive and protective.</p>
<p>The company started primarily in being reactive by figuring what happened in the past, but has begun to expand into these other areas over the last year, and the plan is to continue to build out that functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">the context of SolarWinds</a>, what everyone is trying to figure out is how soon into the supply chain can you figure out what could be potentially wrong by looking at indications of behavior or indications of compromise, and our ability to ingest telemetry from a diverse set of sources, not as a bolt on solution, but something which is built from the ground up, resonated really well,&#8221; Pai explained.</p>
<p>The company had 65 employees when we spoke last year for the Series B. Today, Pai says that number is approaching 140 and he is adding new people every week with a goal to get to around 200 people by the end of the year. He says as the company grows, he keeps diversity top of mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we grow and as we raise capital diversity has been something which has been a high priority and very critical for us,&#8221; he said. In fact, he reports that more than 50% of his employees come from under-represented groups whether it&#8217;s Latinx, Black or Asian heritage.</p>
<p>Pai says that one of the reasons he has been able to build a diverse workforce is his commitment to a remote workplace, which means he can hire from anywhere, something he will continue to do even after the pandemic ends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India said on Wednesday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">WhatsApp’s lawsuit challenging the new local IT rules</a> is an “unfortunate last moment” attempt to prevent new regulations from going into effect in &#8220;a clear act of defiance,&#8221; and said the Facebook-owned service didn’t raise any specific objection about the traceability requirement in writing after October 2018.</p>
<p>Ravi Shankar Prasad, India’s Electronics and IT Minister, said WhatsApp’s refusal to comply with the guidelines, the deadline of which expired Wednesday, is a “clear act of defiance of a measure whose intent can certainly not be doubted.”</p>
<p>WhatsApp sued the Indian government earlier on Wednesday in a Delhi High Court, saying the world&#8217;s second largest internet market&#8217;s new IT rules could allow authorities to make people’s private messages “traceable,” and conduct mass surveillance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India is the largest market by users for the Facebook-owned popular instant messaging service. According to government estimates, WhatsApp has amassed over 530 million users in India.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Electronics and IT said any company&#8217;s operations in India is &#8220;subject to the law of the land,&#8221; and argued that similar or much tougher regulations have been enforced or proposed in other markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;What India is asking for is significantly much less than what some of the other countries have demanded,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>One one hand, &#8220;WhatsApp seeks to mandate a privacy policy wherein it will share the data of all its user with its parent company, Facebook, for marketing and advertising purposes,&#8221; the ministry added. &#8220;On the other hand, WhatsApp makes every effort to refuse the enactment of the Intermediary Guidelines which are necessary to uphold law and order and curb the menace of fake news.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ministry of Electronics and IT said New Delhi needs to trace the first originator of a message for the &#8220;purposes of prevention, investigation, punishment etc. of inter alia an offence relating to sovereignty, integrity and security of India, public order incitement to an offence relating to rape, sexually explicit material or child sexual abuse material punishable with imprisonment for not less than five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in public interest that who started the mischief leading to such crime must be detected and punished. We cannot deny as to how in cases of mob lynching and riots etc. repeated WhatsApp messages are circulated and recirculated whose content are already in public domain. Hence the role of who originated is very important.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ministry wrote to social media firms earlier on Wednesday to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/india-asks-social-media-firms-if-they-have-complied-with-the-new-regulations/">ask for an update on whether they had complied with the new rules</a>, TechCrunch first reported. In the letter, the ministry sought information (name and contact address) of officials who the firms had appointed as part of the compliance to the new rules that require officers to be available on the ground to address local concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;WhatsApp’s attempt to portray the Intermediary Guidelines of India as contrary to the right to privacy is misguided. [&#8230;] The Government of India recognises that ‘Right to Privacy’ is a Fundamental right and is committed to ensure the same to its citizens,&#8221; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.axlepayments.com">Axle</a> recently announced it raised $10m in Series A financing after a stellar year of growth. The round was led by Crosslink Capital with participation from FJ Labs, Flexport, Tribeca Early Stage Partners, and others including existing investors Anthemis Group, Techstars, and Plug and Play Ventures.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company points to the past 12 months of operations where it saw volume grow 850% on its payments and financing platform designed specifically for freight brokers and carriers. The company’s services allows incumbent operators to quickly modernize and compete against new startups. Axle says its solutions also automates carrier payments, involving, and collections, which allows operators to connect all aspects of their fright operations.</p>
<p>Axle anticipates using the new capital to expand operations, develop new services, and strength the company’s payment and financing platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founders Bharath Krishnamoorthy and Shawn Vo founded the company in 2019. The company raised a $1.4 million pre-seed round from Trucks VC in 2020, followed by a $2.7m seed round from Techstars and Anthemis Group and a $27.7 million debt and equity round later that year.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder, Bharath Krishnamoorthy, says in a released statement “Axle’s proprietary technology levels the playing field, so our customers can compete in a highly competitive market. With our financial platform, we’re empowering freight intermediaries to rapidly grow and differentiate their businesses in a cutthroat industry. We’re excited to partner with Crosslink to transform the freight and logistics industry.”</p>
<p>Crosslink Capital partner David Silverman says Krishnamoorthy and Vo established themselves as an industry leader in freight factoring and payment processing, and points to the company’s previous 12 month as being impressive. “We look forward to helping them scale operations,” he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">APIs make the world go round in tech, but that also makes them a very key target for bad actors: as doorways into huge data troves and services, malicious hackers spent a lot of time looking for ways to pick their locks or just force them open when they&#8217;re closed, in order to access that information. And a lot of recent security breaches stemming from API vulnerabilities (see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-google-analytics-to-steal-credit-cards-bypass-csp/?mid=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/geico-driver-license-numbers-scraped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for just a few) show just how real and current the problem is.</p>
<p>Today, a company that&#8217;s building a network of services to help those using and producing APIs to identify and eradicate those risks is announcing a round of funding to meet a growing demand for its services. <a href="https://salt.security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salt Security</a>, which provides AI-based technology to identify issues and stop attacks across the whole of your API library, has closed $70 million in funding, money that it will be using both to meet current demand but also continue building out its technology for a wider set of services and use cases for API management.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Advent International, by way of Advent Tech, with Alkeon Capital, DFJ Growth and previous backers Sequoia Capital, Tenaya Capital, S Capital VC, and Y Combinator all also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Salt, founded in Israel and now active globally, is not disclosing valuation but I understand from a reliable source it that it is in the region of $600-700 million.</p>
<p>As with many of the funding rounds that seem to be getting announced these days, this one is coming on the heels of both another recent round, as well as strong growth. Salt has raised $131 million since 2016, but nearly all of that &#8212; $120 million, to be exact &#8212; has been raised in the last year.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for that is Salt&#8217;s performance: in the last 12 months, it&#8217;s seen revenue grow 400% &#8212; with customers including a range of Fortune 500 and other large businesses in the financial services, retail and SaaS sectors like Equinix, Finastra, TripActions, Armis, and DeinDeal; headcount grow 160%; and, perhaps most importantly, API traffic on its network grow 380%.</p>
<p>That growth in API traffic underscores the issue that Salt is tackling. Companies these days use a variety of APIs &#8212; some private, some public &#8212; in their tech stack as a way to interface with other businesses and run their services. APIs are a huge part of how the Internet and digital services operate, with Akamai estimating that as much as 83% of all IP traffic is API traffic.</p>
<p>The problem, Roey Eliyahu, CEO and co-founder of Salt Security told me, is that this usage has outpaced how well many manage those APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;How APIs have evolved is very different to how developers used APIs years ago,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Before, there were very few, and you could say they were more manageable, and they contained less sensitive data, and there were very few changes and updates made to them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Today with the pace of development, not only are they always getting updated, but you have thousands of them now touching crown jewels of the company.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has made them a prime target for malicious hackers. Eliyahu notes Gartner stats that predict that by 2022, APIs will make up the largest attack vector in cybercrime.</p>
<p>Salt&#8217;s approach starts with taking stock of a whole network and doing a kind of spring clean to find all the APIs that might be used or abused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies don&#8217;t know how many APIs they even have,&#8221; Eliyahu said, noting that there some 40%-80% of the APIs in existence for a typical company&#8217;s data are not even in active operation, lying there as &#8220;shadow APIs&#8221; for someone to pick up and misuse.</p>
<p>It then looks at what vulnerabilities might inadvertently be contained in this mix and makes suggestions for how to alter them to fix that. After this, it also monitors how they are used in order to stop attacks as they happen. The third of these also involves remediation &#8220;insights&#8221;, but carrying out the remediation is done by third parties at the moment, Eliyahu said. All of this is done through Salt&#8217;s automated, AI-based, flagship Salt Security API Protection Platform.</p>
<p>There are a number of competitors in the same space as Salt, including Ping, and newer players like Imvision and 42Crunch (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/api-security-startup-42crunch-raises-17m-series-a-led-by-energy-impact-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised funding</a> earlier this month), and the list is likely to grow as not just other API management companies get deeper into this huge space, but cyber security companies do, too.</p>
<p>“The rapid proliferation of APIs has dramatically altered the attack surface of applications, creating a major challenge for large enterprises since existing security mechanisms cannot protect against this new threat,” said Bryan Taylor, managing partner and head of Advent’s technology team, in a statement. “We continue to see API security incidents make the news headlines and cause significant reputational risk for companies. As we investigated the API security market, Salt stood out for its multi-year technical lead, significant customer traction and references, and talented team. We look forward to drawing on our deep experience in this sector to partner with Salt in this exciting new chapter.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.clara.cc/">Clara</a> announced that it closed a new, $30 million funding round and secured a $50 million revolving debt facility.</p>
<p>The startup, which provides corporate cards to Mexican companies, raised funds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">earlier this year</a> when it was busy launching its product. Since then, growth has proven rapid for the Mexico City-based company.</p>
<p>TechCrunch learned that the company is valued around $130 million after this latest investment, according to sources familiar with its latest fundraising. The round added DST and monashees to Clara&#8217;s cap table; prior investor General Catalyst also contributed funds to the deal.</p>
<p>We spoke with <a href="https://twitter.com/ggiaco?lang=en">Gerry Giacomán Colyer</a>, a co-founder at the startup and its CEO, about why Clara raised more capital so quickly after it last closed a financing round. The short gist is that the company&#8217;s growth, and market, allowed it to raise easily. And that the startup has pretty big plans, so having more capital with which to hire is welcome.</p>
<p>Per Giacomán Colyer, since he last spoke to this publication the transaction volume (GTV) that Clara supports has grown by 100x. His company is managing 2x week-over-week growth at times, which is super rapid. That&#8217;s precisely the sort of usage growth that venture capitalists covet; and as Clara makes revenue from interchange fees that stem from transaction volume, the startup is likely seeing its revenue advance at roughly the same rate as its GTV.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WQdDokGuWD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/">How Brex more than doubled its valuation in a year</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Brex more than doubled its valuation in a year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/embed/#?secret=WQdDokGuWD" data-secret="WQdDokGuWD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That Clara was able to raise more capital is unsurprising. Not only is it growing quickly in its home market with designs on Brazil in the future, a U.S.-based player in the same space recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">sold for north of $2 billion</a>. Divvy&#8217;s sale was likely a shot in the arm for not only Clara, but also Brex and Ramp, two other well-known players in the larger corporate spend world.</p>
<p>Clara&#8217;s success in Mexico makes it likely that related startups also targeting markets that lack a modern corporate spend solution will see strong venture capital interest; I would not be surprised if we heard from a number of other companies attacking geographies with favorable interchange economics with a similar model, as it has proven to be so lucrative.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Giacomán Colyer about who his company is targeting in terms of customers; Brex famously got its start working with high-growth startups before moving to work with a broader array of companies. Clara is working with startups in the Mexican market, the company said, but also with larger firms as well. Its CEO said that its underwriting model is set up to support more traditional cash-flow modeling.</p>
<p>So far Clara has largely attracted customers via word-of-mouth, and is working to bolster its referral system. But now that it has lots more capital, it will be interesting to see if the startup builds out a more aggressive go-to-market motion.</p>
<p>And more than just equity capital, the debt that Clara also secured as part of its recent funding round will help it underwrite customers without having to work off of its own balance sheet. Giacomán Colyer said that even after the capital costs associated with the facility, Clara&#8217;s economics are still good. Interchange is a flexible beast, it seems.</p>
<p>To that end, TechCrunch asked Giacomán Colyer if his company intends to charge for software in time, or merely eat off of interchange. In the United States, Brex is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/">now in camp one</a>, along <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/spend-control-focused-airbase-adds-23-5m-to-its-series-a-as-it-posts-quick-growth/">with Airbase</a>, while Ramp is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/">sticking to camp two</a>. Divvy proved that you can get to nine-figures in top line without charging for software, though having some ARR in the mix along with interchange incomes could provide a margin-boost to interchange top line. Regardless, Clara appears happy to keep to interchange for the time being.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how quickly Clara can keep scaling. We&#8217;ll check back with the company in a few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A decade before investing outside of San Francisco and New York became trendy, entrepreneurs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jewelburks">Jewel Burks</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justindawkins/"> Justin Dawkins </a>and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrygivens/">Barry Givens</a> were betting on Atlanta. Each experienced first-hand the biases that disproportionately hurts Black founders &#8211; while also being living proof of the wave of Black innovation and opportunity in their city.</p>
<p>Last year, the trio saw opportunity in that disconnect and launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs/">Collab Capital</a>, a firm designed to invest explicitly in Black founders. It debuted with $2 million in capital and a massive end target: $50 million. Today, the firm announced that it has met that goal, with backers such as Apple, Goldman Sachs, Google, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Mailchimp, and PayPal, making it one of the largest funds closed from an entirely Black-led firm solely committed to Black founders.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Collab Capital launches with a $50 million target and a mission to help Black entrepreneurs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs/embed/#?secret=wEi24X2W07" data-secret="wEi24X2W07" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We really wanted to build a fund that was appropriate for the opportunity that we see [in Black founders],” Burks said. “And honestly I would say, it’s a small fund out there relative to the number of Black-led companies out there that are looking and seeking funding.”</p>
<p>With the new fund, Collab Capital plans to invest in 50 companies over a three-to-five-year period with check sizes between $500,000 and $750,000. The firm has also reserved up to $2 million per investment for follow-on bets. It is targeting ownership between 10% to 15% in each deal. To date, Collab Capital has backed six companies in the healthcare, edtech, and future of work spaces, including Music Tech Works and Hairbrella.</p>
<p>Internally, the team plans to stay based in Atlanta. Burks, who founded Atlanta-based PartPic, a TC Battlefield company that sold to Amazon, said that reinvesting in the community has always been a part of Collab Capital’s intention. Case in point? The firm’s first three deals were in Atlanta. As Zoom investing became more popular in the wake of the coronavirus, the team invested in startups from Kansas City, Washington, D.C., and Miami, as well.</p>

<p>“We’re excited to be able to support founders anywhere in the United States, but we’re really focused on cities that have a high concentration of Black innovators and a lower concentration of capital,” she said.</p>
<h2><strong>The world before June</strong></h2>
<p>While part of Collab’s focus is avoiding coastal cities, network matters. The firm’s ability to secure heavyweight investors such as Apple and PayPal gives it a key signal that validates its bet on Black founders.</p>
<p>Burks thinks part of the reason that investors might be more intentional about backing firms such as hers is the result of the racial injustice that was highlighted in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black people at the hands of police.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ix7vU7SFB1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">Venture firms rush to find ways to support Black founders and investors</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Venture firms rush to find ways to support Black founders and investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/embed/#?secret=ix7vU7SFB1" data-secret="ix7vU7SFB1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After Floyd and Taylor were murdered, there was a global movement spearheaded by Black Lives Matter in response to police brutality and racism in the United States. Burks says that Collab Capital had only raised a few million at that time, but then witnessed “a shift in the hearts and minds of capital allocators.”</p>
<p>Burks noted that when Collab Capital was first raising its fund, potential investors told them to have a “wider perspective” on what kinds of entrepreneurs to back. Some thought they should create a fund around underrepresented founders or multicultural founders. With general VC volatility in the early months of the pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs/">Collab Capital saw some of its LPs pull back</a> or delay commitments.</p>
<p>“We were very adamant that the most important thing we wanted to solve was the funding gap for Black founders, so we were not willing to broaden the spectrum there because we saw that there were so many firms out there for diverse founders, and even in some of those, Black founders were still marginalized.”</p>
<p>While the majority of venture dollars are still managed by white men, Black-led venture capital firms are having quite the year. Collab Capital’s news is preceded by Harlem Capital, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">closed a $134 million seed fund </a>earlier this year, Cleo Capital, which set a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/cleo-capital-is-targeting-20-million-for-fund-ii/'"> $20 million target for Fund II</a>, and MaC VC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/closing-on-103-million-mac-venture-capital-is-changing-the-face-of-venture-capital/">landing $103 million for its inaugural fund. </a></p>
<p>Beyond a broader understanding of the importance of diversity in tech, Burks pointed to Zoom as a value unlock.</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;d asked me a year ago [if] I think we&#8217;d be successful in raising $50 million over Zoom meetings, I would have said absolutely not,” she said. “But you can build meaningful relationships with people and not even have to be in person. That’s a big surprise &#8212; and, oh, the realization that you don’t have to travel so much.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The high stakes game of chess (or, well, consolidation chicken) that is on-demand food delivery rolls on today with a little more territorial swapping in Europe: Barcelona-based Glovo has agreed to buy three of Berlin-based Delivery Hero&#8217;s food delivery brands in Central and Eastern Europe &#8212; with deals that it said are worth a total value of €170 million (~$208M).</p>
<p>Specifically, it&#8217;s picking up Delivery Hero&#8217;s foodpanda brand in Romania and Bulgaria; the Donesi brand in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina; and Pauza in Croatia.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some notable symmetry here: Last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/delivery-hero-picks-up-glovos-latam-ops-for-272m-in-latest-food-delivery-consolidation/">Delivery Hero shelled out $272M for a bunch of Glovo&#8217;s LatAm brands</a>, as the latter gave up on a region it had already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/glovo-exits-the-middle-east-and-drops-two-latam-markets-in-latest-food-delivery-crunch/">started withdrawing from</a> in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/spains-glovo-grabs-166m-series-e-for-its-deliver-anything-app/">quest for profitability</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Glovo said then that it would be focusing on &#8220;key markets where we can build a long-term sustainable business and continue to provide our unique multi-category offering to our customers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the Barcelona-based &#8216;deliver anything&#8217; app also announced it was picking up Ehrana, a local delivery company in Slovenia. So it&#8217;s been on quite the (local) shopping spree of late.</p>
<p>Its existing operational footprint covers markets in South West Europe, Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. So its attention here, on the Balkans, suggests it sees a chance to eke out profitable potential in more of Central Europe too.</p>
<p>Glovo said the transactions in Bosnia Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia are expected to close &#8220;within the next few weeks&#8221;, subject to fulfilment of closing conditions and relevant regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>While it said Romania will be completed following approval from the competition authority &#8212; but gave no timeline for that.</p>
<p>Its splurge on Central and Eastern European rival food delivery brands follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/">$528M Series F funding round in April</a> &#8212; so it&#8217;s evidently not short of VC cash to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">burn</span> spend.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Oscar Pierre, CEO and co-founder, said: “It’s always been central to our long-term strategy to focus on markets where we see clear opportunities to lead and where we can build a sustainable business. Central and Eastern Europe is a very important part of that plan. The region has really embraced on-demand delivery platforms and we’re very excited to be strengthening our presence and increasing our footprint in countries that continue to show enormous potential for growth.” <b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">In another supporting statement Delivery Hero made it clear it has bigger fish to fry (than can be served up to hungry customers in the Balkans) right now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Delivery Hero has built a clear leading business in the Balkan region in the last couple of years. However, with a lot of operational priorities on our plate, we believe <span class="il">Glovo</span> would be better positioned to continue building an amazing experience for our customers in this region,&#8221; said Niklas Östberg, its CEO and co-founder.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A relevant, recent development for <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/delivery-hero-to-launch-operations-in-berlin/">Delivery Hero</a>&#8216;s business is the decision to re-enter its home market of Germany &#8212; Europe&#8217;s biggest economy &#8212; under its foodpanda brand, starting in its home city of Berlin this summer (but with a national expansion planned to follow).</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is notable because back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/takeaway-delivery-hero-gobble-gobble/">2018</a> it sold its German operations to another on-demand food delivery rival, the Dutch giant Takeaway.com &#8212; in a $1.1BN deal which included the Lieferheld, Pizza.de and foodora brands <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8212; temporarily stepping out of the competitive fray.</span> (<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Meanwhile Takeaway.com has since merged with the UK&#8217;s Just Eat to become&#8230; </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/justeat-takeaway-7-6b-merger-approved-pair-pick-up-756m-in-new-funding/">Just Eat Takeaway</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> so, uh, keep up.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Delivery Hero is returning to Germany now because it can, and because the market is huge. A two-year non-compete clause between it and Just Eat Takeaway recently expired &#8212; allowing for reheating (rehashing?) of the competitive food delivery mix in German cities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6b52561c-63a9-4393-928b-c05a03ae6404">FT</a> back in May about this market return, Östberg suggested Delivery Hero has girded itself (and its investors) for a long fight.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We don’t see necessarily that we are going to go in and win the market in the next year or so. This is a 10-year game,&#8221; he said. “Of course we will definitely make sure we put in enough money to be the clear number two, the clear challenger [to Just Eat Takeaway.com].”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Winning at food delivery is certainly a(n expensive) marathon, not a sprint.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are also of course multiple races being run in markets around the world, depending on local conditions and competitive mix &#8212; with the chance that the winner of the biggest and most lucrative races will reach such a position of VC-sponsored glory that it can buy up the top competitors from the smaller races and consolidate everything &#8212; maximizing economies of scale and gaining the ability to squeeze out fresh competition to grab a juicy profit for themselves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Or, well, that&#8217;s the theory. Competition regulators are likely to take increasing interest in this space, for one thing. Rising awareness of gig economy workers rights is also putting pressure on the model.</p>
<p>For now, the thin-margin food delivery business needs the right base conditions to survive. The model only functions in cities and ideally in highly dense urban environments. Most of the players in this space also do not employ the armies of riders that are needed to make deliveries &#8212; because doing so would make the model far more costly. And in Europe political attention on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">gig economy workers rights </a>could force reforms that raise regional operational costs, putting further pressure on margins.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/">Spain has its own labor reforms in train</a> that will affect Glovo in its home market, for example.</p>
<p>Achieving sustainability (i.e. profitability without the need for ongoing VC funding injections) remains a huge hurdle for delivery apps. It will likely require massive market consolidation and/or convincing users to switch from making the occasional order of a hot meal on a weekend to relying on app-based delivery for far more of their local shopping needs &#8212; not just lunch/dinner but groceries and toiletries, and other fast moving consumers goods and household items.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/spains-glovo-inks-real-estate-tie-up-to-add-more-dark-stores-for-speedy-urban-delivery/">super fast grocery delivery is a major focus for Glovo</a>, for example &#8212; which has recently been building out networks of inner city dark stores to service in-app convenience store shopping.</p>
<p>Lots of other on-demand app players are also ramping up on that front. Including Delivery Hero &#8212; which has been paying more attention to groceries (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/on-demand-grocery-startup-instashop-acquired-by-delivery-hero-for-360m/">picking up InstaShop last year</a> in a deal worth $360M).</p>
<p>Glovo building out in Central Europe while exiting markets further afield suggests it believes it can use a concentrated market footprint to drive operational efficiencies and strong order margins through a tightly integrated meal delivery and dark store play.</p>
<p>If it can do that &#8212; and offer at least the whiff of profitability &#8212; it could make its business an attractive future acquisition target for a larger global giant that&#8217;s looking to up the &#8216;consolidation chicken&#8217; stakes by bolting on new regions.</p>
<p>A larger player like Delivery Hero may even be a potential future suitor &#8212; having shown it&#8217;s happy to return to markets it left earlier. After all, it surely knows Glovo&#8217;s business pretty well since they&#8217;ve done a number of market swaps. But, for now, that&#8217;s pure speculation.</p>
<p>Zooming out, what the on-demand model of app-based urban convenience means for the future of urban environments is a whole other question &#8212; and one which both competition and urban regulators will need to ponder very carefully.</p>
<p>If the rush to scale delivery platforms drives unstoppable consolidation that sees smaller players gobbled up by a few global giants &#8212; that can then use their size and scale to outcompete local shops &#8212; it may spell even more dark times for the traditional High Street and its family-run bodegas.</p>
<p>Local retail in many places has already been hammered by Internet giants like Amazon. Delivery apps are another high tech threat to bricks-and-mortar shopping. Touch of a button convenience does carry wider costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Facebook has long been working on raising WhatsApp&#8217;s profile as a channel for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/whatsapp-business-now-with-50m-maus-adds-qr-code-and-catalog-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">businesses</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-adds-hosting-shopping-features-and-pricing-tiers-to-whatsapp-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interact with</a> (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell to</a>) their customers. Today, a startup that has built a suite of tools for retailers and others to build and run those services over WhatsApp and other messaging platforms is announcing growth funding to address that opportunity.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.yalo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yalo</a>, which describes itself as a c-commerce (&#8220;chat commerce&#8221;) startup building tools for businesses to use messaging apps as part of their customer outreach and sales strategies, has raised $50 million, funding that it will be using to expand its services with a specific focus on emerging markets like Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="p1">Yalo already counts big brands like Unilever, Nestle, Coca-Cola and Walmart among the customers using its platform for sales and marketing efforts. In total that speaks to potentially an audience of 350 million, although Yaho doesn&#8217;t disclose how many people are actually using Yalo services as a part of that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The funding is being led by B Capital, with participation from other, undisclosed, investors. Yalo, which recently rebranded from Yalochat, is on a funding roll at the moment: the company&#8217;s last round was in August, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/yalochat-a-fast-growing-conversational-commerce-startup-lands-15-million-led-by-b-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$15 million Series B</a>. B Capital&#8217;s investment is interesting, given Yalo&#8217;s focus on building tools for businesses to better utilize Facebook apps to interact with customers: the VC firm was co-founded by Eduardo Saverin, one of Facebook&#8217;s co-founders.</p>
<p>CEO Javier Mata said in an emailed interview that the reason for the swift funding was because of how fast business has been growing in the last year, part of the bigger boom for e-commerce overall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Covid fast forwarded us into the future and with it the need for conversational commerce increased significantly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It went from being [one] digital commerce channel to becoming the main one.&#8221; He said that some of Yalo&#8217;s customers are seeing 80% of their sales happening on top of (and inside) messaging apps, a huge shift when you consider how reliant some brands in the consumer packaged goods sector have in the past been on more physical retail channels, whether that was a supermarket, a corner shop or a vending machine. &#8220;The market demand increased and we raised to continue overdelivering to customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Yalo wasn&#8217;t looking for more funding, &#8220;but then we saw an opportunity to accelerate our growth, so we did it. Everything we do is to provide value to our customers and in this case we decided to accelerate our product development so that customers would get conversational marketing, payments, and the world would get no-code builder to create all kind of conversational app sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yalo is not disclosing its valuation with this round, CEO Javier Mata said in an email interview. The startup has raised $75 million to date, with other past investors including NXTP from Argentina and Sierra Ventures.</p>
<p>Founded in Mexico, now based in San Francisco, and currently active in Mexico, India, Brazil and the U.S., Yalo&#8217;s strategy is to play into the role messaging apps have taken on for consumers in many markets, but especially emerging markets, where many people &#8220;live&#8221; when on their phones, using them not just to chat to friends, but to interact with a wide range of services.</p>
<p>This is also something that messaging companies like Facebook, taking a page from companies like WeChat and Line in Asia, have been looking to cultivate. Over the years, WeChat and Line have leveraged their success as basic messaging apps to build out wider &#8220;super apps&#8221; covering all kinds of other forms of communication, as well as a plethora of services like payments, shopping, entertainment and news, both build by the apps themselves as well as by third parties, and now used by hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>WhatsApp is Yalo&#8217;s biggest platform &#8220;by a lot,&#8221; said Mata, with SMS in second place, so this is where a lot of its focus is right now.</p>
<p class="p3">While WhatsApp has been building out the facility to provide more services, Yalo has built a platform that sits in between brands and the apps themselves in order to use them. Its service &#8212; which works with other apps as well (it describes itself as platform-agnostic and able to be embedded in any messaging app) &#8212; lets agencies or the brands themselves plan and run marketing and sales campaigns, offer helpdesk services and take payments, giving customers the option to create &#8220;micro apps&#8221; to live in various messaging environments.</p>
<p>The emerging market focus for Yalo seems to mirror the role that messaging and mobile have taken in these markets overall. In many cases, consumers in developing economies skipped straight over using traditional computers and went online for the first time with cheap smartphones. As a result, that paved the way for consumers, whose digital consumption was more focused on mobile screens, to being more receptive and likely to use messaging apps for more than just messaging.</p>
<p>Mata believes that while emerging markets may have paved the way, though, more developed economies will follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We went from brick and mortar to desktop apps, from apps to web apps, from web apps to mobile apps, and now the future/present is about conversational apps,&#8221; Mata said. &#8220;Conversational apps are the future because they take advantage of the messaging app that people have already downloaded and they do not need users to install or learn a new ux. It is easier to adopt a new technology when you do not need to replace a lot of legacy technology and you can just leapfrog. That is exactly what emerging markets are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He believes that &#8220;the US and other markets will get there but they will take longer, and eventually the lines between e-commerce and c-commerce will blur. You are starting to see that with text marketing, which is only a tiny fraction of conversational and it is already huge. It&#8217;s not a surprise that China is further ahead in digital than the US and conversational commerce is the predominant way of commerce through WeChat. Emerging markets leapfrog when it comes to adopting new tech.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, <span class="s2">BCG<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OYFlp8ZJJv-kzIlp4bi49m1S318EP6j9/view"> <span class="s3">estimates </span></a>that c-commerce is already a $35 billion market, and will grow to $130 billion by 2025 in emerging markets alone, accounting for 60% of all digital commerce.</span></p>
<p class="p6">The question will be, then, that if this really takes off, whether the likes of Facebook will try to own the integration experience as much as owning the platform itself, or whether those who have helped to build more interesting commerce experiences on the traditional web &#8212; companies like Shopify and Magento, but also Amazon &#8212; might try to own this space too, presenting more competition down the line for Yalo.</p>
<p>Not an issue for now, investors say.</p>
<p class="p6">“Yalo has become the leading conversational commerce company, revolutionizing the way large enterprises engage with their customers and enabling them to transact through chat applications. We have been impressed with their execution and are very pleased t<span class="s2">o expand our r</span>elationship with them by leading their Series C round.” said Saverin in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationships between banks and fintechs are multi-faceted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, they partner. In many cases, they compete. In other cases, one acquires or invests in the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, today, an announcement by global payments giant Visa is aimed at helping facilitate banks and fintechs’ ability to work together.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Visa said today it has expanded its </span><a href="https://partner.visa.com/site/programs/fintech-partner-connect.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa Fintech Partner Connect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a program designed to help financial institutions quickly connect with a “vetted and curated” set of technology providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry Angelos, senior vice president and global head of fintech at Visa, to understand just exactly what that means.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Global fintech investment last year was $105 billion,” Angelos said. “There were about 2,861 deals in venture, PE and M&amp;A. So literally over $100 billion is going into fintech, which is more than the combined tech budgets of every bank in the U.S. As a result, a lot of innovation that is occurring in fintech is funded by venture dollars. We’re trying to bring that innovation to our clients, whether they are banks, processors or other fintechs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program initially launched in Europe in November of 2020, and now is available in the U.S., Asia Pacific, Latin American and CEMEA (Central Europe, Middle East and Africa). Visa has worked to identify fintechs that can help banks and financial institutions (that are clients of Visa’s) as well as other fintechs “create digital-first experiences, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">without the cost and complexity of building the back-end technology in-house.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local teams will run programs in the respective regions, and vet and manage partners in the following categories: account opening, data aggregation, analytics and security, customer engagement and new cardholder services and operations and compliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Visa has identified about 60 partners that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer a range of technologies &#8212; from back-office functions to new front-end services, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Angelos. Those partners include Alloy, Jumio, Argyle, Fidel, FirstSource, TravelBank, Canopy, Hummingbird and Unit21, among others. Twenty-four are located in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So much of fintech focus and coverage is about disrupting existing banks. Everyone is trying to disrupt everyone, including fintechs like PayPal,” Angelos told TechCrunch. “Venture numbers are certainly very large. What we’re realizing is there is a significant opportunity to pair up a lot of venture-backed companies with our existing clients. It runs a little bit against us versus them approach you typically hear about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa clients can get in touch with program partners via the </span><a href="https://partner.visa.com/site/programs/fintech-partner-connect.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa Partner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website and get benefits such as reduced implementation fees and pricing discounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fintech Connect program is about both helping to identify and curate interesting fintech companies and then create a favorable commercial partnership for our clients so they can engage with these Fintech Connect partners,” Angelos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what does Visa gain from all this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is that all of our clients are in a position to build better digital experiences for their consumers,” he told TechCrunch. “We would love it if every bank had the latest tools in order to onboard clients and build digital experiences.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of its partners, for example, is virtual card startup Extend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are fintechs that provide this today such as TripActions, Ramp and Divvy,” Angelos points out. “But what Visa is doing is looking at ‘How can we enable our banking clients to do something similar?’ So we’re bringing innovation into our ecosystem so that anyone can take advantage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can also help companies such as TripActions, Ramp or Divvy with other complementary technologies for security posture, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The net beneficiary is to hopefully move more spending onto those rails,” Angelos said. “For example, if you look at B2B spend, there’s about $120 trillion of it annually. We believe about $20 trillion of that is card eligible. Today, Visa captures about $1 trillion of that. So, another $19 trillion is available for Visa to capture through our partners if our banks and fintechs can build these kinds of solutions to enable B2B payments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Visa also invests in startups from time to time. But this initiative is distinct from those efforts, although a couple of its partners have been recipients of funding from Visa.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India has asked social media firms to provide an update on whether they have complied with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new IT rules</a> &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221; and &#8220;preferably today&#8221; even as the new regulations are being legally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">challenged by WhatsApp</a>.</p>
<p>In a letter to &#8220;significant social media intermediaries&#8221; &#8212; which New Delhi defines as social media firms with over 5 million registered users in India &#8212; on Wednesday, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asked the firms to share the names of their apps, websites, or services that will come under the scope of the new IT rules and the status of their compliance.</p>
<p>The letter, obtained by TechCrunch, also asks the firms to provide names and contact details of chief compliance officer, nodal contact person, and resident grievance officer that they have appointed in India as part of the compliance, and also asked for the physical address of the local office. The new rules, unveiled in February this year, mandate that firms have several officials in India to address on-ground concerns.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The letter also implies that India doesn&#8217;t plan to give social media firms any extension on the deadline, which expires on Wednesday, to comply with the new regulations. &#8220;The additional due diligence required from SSMI [significant social media intermediaries] have come into effect today, at the conclusion of three additional months given to SSMIs,&#8221; it said. Shortly after unveiling the new IT rules, India had notified firms to comply within three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are not considered as SSMI, please provide the reasons for the same including the registered users on each of the services provided by you,&#8221; the letter adds. &#8220;The government reserves the right to seek any additional information, as may be permitted within these Rules and the IT Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, WhatsApp sued the Indian government challenging the second largest internet market’s new regulations that it said could allow authorities to make people’s private messages “traceable,” and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-is-traceability-and-why-does-whatsapp-oppose-it">conduct mass surveillance</a>.</p>
<p>Tension has been brewing between American technology giants and the Indian government over the past few months. Earlier this year, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">refused to block accounts that criticized</a> New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>Last month, the Indian government ordered Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to take down posts that were critical of Modi’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">handling of the coronavirus pandemic</a>. Last week, New Delhi objected to Twitter’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">labeling of some of its politicians’ tweets as manipulated media</a>.  This week, police in Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">visited Twitter offices</a> to “serve a notice” about an investigation into its intel on classifying politicians&#8217; tweets as misleading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big tech like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp, and Google often make terrible policies and decisions that are often harming millions of Indians. All of us at IFF, are consistently advocating with our public authorities for user rights centric regulations that help address them,&#8221; said New Delhi-based digital rights advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation, <a href="https://internetfreedom.in/pound-the-alarm-the-clock-strikes-for-social-media-tomorrow-with-the-intermediaries-rules-coming-into-effect/">in a statement</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our clear belief that the Intermediaries Rules do not fix these outstanding issues, suffer from core defects of procedural and substantive legality and end up harming your rights as well as the innovation which makes the internet so special and exciting. Today, more than ever we need to follow a path that is led by experts and the values of the Indian constitution.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (also known as Bappepti) began regulating Bitcoin and other cryptoassets as commodities two years ago, paving the way for licensed brokers like Pintu. Founded last year by Jeth Soetoyo to make it easier for first-time investors to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, Pintu is registered under Bappebti and the Ministry of Communication and Informatics as a licensed cryptoassets broker.</p>
<p>A wave of interest in capital investing during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among millennials who want alternatives to keeping their money in low-yield savings accounts, spurred interest in investment apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indonesian-robo-advisor-app-bibit-raises-30-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">Bibit</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/indonesian-savings-and-investment-app-pluang-gets-20m-in-pre-series-b-funding/">Pluang</a>, which have all recently raised funding.</p>
<p>Many first-time investors are also looking at cryptocurrencies. According to Pintu’s internal estimates, last year Indonesia processed $10 billion USD in cryptoassets transactions, mostly through retail investors.</p>

<p>Pintu chief operating officer Andrew Adjiputro told TechCrunch in an email that many Indonesian retail traders see crypto as an alternative investment asset class, and that the majority of retail investors are aged 20 to 35 years old. But the company is starting to see more older investors as crypto gains popularity.</p>
<p>“Based on our internal survey, in terms of public’s top of mind asset classes, we see crypto as a top three asset class in Indonesia, alongside gold and mutual funds,” he said.</p>
<p>Other Indonesian cryptocurrency exchanges include Indodax and Tokocrypto. When asked how Pintu differentiates, Adjiputro said it focuses on the mass market to reach mainly first-time crypto users, and its value proposition lies in its mobile-first app, easy user experience and educational materials developed by the company.</p>
<p>“For most Indonesians, the concept of investing and trading is new, because historically penetration in these categories have been so low,” he explained. “So what we’re seeing is also the opportunity to help Indonesians understand the concept of investing/trading and along the way leapfrog investments into other asset classes. What this means is that there is a large base of underserved first time investors that demand a simple and intuitive trading platform where they are handheld from the start to finish and also educated on the fundamentals of investing/trading on top of that of crypto.”</p>
<p>Pintu’s new funding will be used on marketing, hiring and product development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The handling of user data in China has become a delicate matter for foreign tech companies operating in the country. Apple&#8217;s move to store the data of its Chinese customers in servers managed by a Chinese state-owned cloud service has stoked controversy in the West over the years. A recent New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html">investigation</a> found that the setup could give Beijing easy access to Apple&#8217;s user data in China, but Apple said it &#8220;never compromised the security&#8221; of its customers or their data.</p>
<p>Tesla, one of the few U.S. tech heavyweights that generate substantial revenues from China, is working out a similar data plan. The electric carmaker said it has established a data center in China to carry out the &#8220;localization of data storage,&#8221; with plans to add more data facilities in the future, the company <a href="https://weibo.com/3615027564/Kh8mMfpDQ?from=page_1006063615027564_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment">announced</a> through its account on microblogging platform Weibo. All data generated by Tesla vehicles sold in mainland China will be kept domestically.</p>
<p>Tesla is acting in response to <a href="http://www.moj.gov.cn/pub/sfbgw/zlk/202105/t20210512_392004.html">new requirements</a> drafted by the Chinese government to regulate how cameras- and sensors-enabled carmakers collect and utilize data. One of the requirements states that &#8220;personal or important data should be stored within the [Chinese] territory.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what level of data access Chinese authorities have to Tesla&#8217;s Chinese customers. In the case of Apple, the phone maker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html">said</a> it controlled the keys that protect the data of its Chinese users.</p>
<p>Tesla recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tesla-china-backlash/">fell out of favor</a> with Chinese media and the public after a customer protested the carmaker&#8217;s faulted parts at an auto show in Shanghai, earning her widespread sympathy. Tesla also faces fierce competition from domestic rivals like Nio and Xpeng, which are investing heavily in world-class designs and autonomous driving technology.</p>
<p>The American firm clearly wants the government&#8217;s good graces in its second-largest market. It appeared a few days ago at an<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/vuMo8hk7QNVGhRimQ5wYqA"> industry symposium</a> along with Baidu, Alibaba, research institutions, and think tanks to discuss the new vehicle policy proposed by the country&#8217;s cybersecurity watchdog.</p>
<p>“Important data” generated by vehicles as defined by the Chinese internet regulator include traffic conditions in military and government compounds; surveying and mapping data beyond what the government discloses; status of electric charging grids; face, voice, and car plate information; and any data deemed as affecting national security or public interest.</p>
<p>The rules also urge car service providers not to track users by default, as well as inform users of the kinds of data being collected and the reasons as to why. If gathered, information should be anonymized and stored for only &#8220;a minimum period of time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With more people than ever before going online to pay for things and pay each other, startups that are building the infrastructure that enables these actions continue to get a lot of attention.</p>
<p>In the latest development, <a href="https://paysend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paysend</a>, a fintech that has built a mobile-based payments platform &#8212; which currently offers international money transfers, global accounts, and business banking and e-commerce for SMBs &#8212; has picked up some money of its own. The London-based startup has closed a round of $125 million, a sizable Series B that the company&#8217;s CEO and founder Ronnie Millar said it will be using both to continue expanding its business geographically, to hire more people, and to continue building more fintech products.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by One Peak, with Infravia Growth Capital, Hermes GPE, previous backer Plug and Play and others participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Millar said Paysend is not disclosing valuation today but described it as a &#8220;substantial kick-up&#8221; and &#8220;a great step forward in our position ahead towards unicorn status.&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I understand though, the company was valued at $160 million in its previous round, and its core metrics have gone up 4.5x. Doing some basic math, that gives the company a valuation of around $720 million, a figure that a source close to the company did not dispute when I brought it up.</p>
<p>Something that likely caught investors&#8217; attention is that Paysend has grown to the size it is today &#8212; it currently has 3.7 million consumer customers using its transfer and global account services, and 17,000 small business customers, and is now available in 110 receiving countries &#8212; in less than four years and $50 million in funding.</p>
<p>There are a couple of notable things about Paysend and its position in the market today, the first being the competitive landscape.</p>
<p>On paper, Paysend appears to offer many of the same features as a number of other fintechs: money transfer, global payments, and banking and e-commerce services for smaller businesses are all well-trodden areas with companies like Wise (formerly &#8220;TransferWise&#8221;), PayPal, Revolut, and so many others also providing either all or a range of these services.</p>
<p>To me, the fact that any one company relatively off the tech radar can grow to the size that it has speaks about the opportunity in the market for more than just one or two, or maybe five, dominant players.</p>
<p>Considering just remittances alone, the WorldBank in April said that flows just to low- and middle-income countries stood at <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/05/12/defying-predictions-remittance-flows-remain-strong-during-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$540 million last year</a>, and that was with a dip in volumes due to Covid-19. The cut that companies like Paysend make in providing services to send money is, of course, significantly smaller than that &#8212; business models include commission charges, flat fees, or making money off exchange rates; Paysend charges £1 per transfer in the UK. More than that, the overall volumes, and the opportunity to build more services for that audience, are why we&#8217;re likely to see a lot of companies with ambitions to serve that market.</p>
<p>Services for small businesses, and tapping into the opportunity to provide more e-commerce tools at a time when more business and sales are being conducted online, is similarly crowded but also massive.</p>
<p>Indeed, Paysend points out that there is still a lot of growing and evolution left to do. Citing McKinsey research, it notes that some 70% of international payments are currently still cash-to-cash, with fees averaging up to 5.2% per transaction, and timing taking up to an hour each for sender and recipient to complete transfers. (Paysend claims it can cut fees by up to 60%.)</p>
<p>This brings us to the second point about Paysend: how it&#8217;s built its services. The fintech world today leans heavily on APIs: companies that are knitting together a lot of complexity and packaging it into APIs that are used by others who bypass needing to build those tools themselves, instead integrating them and adding better user experience and responsive personalization around them. notes, is a little different from these, with a vertically integrated approach, having itself built everything that it uses from the ground up.</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Millar &#8212; a Scottish repeat entrepreneur (his previous company Paywizard, which has rebranded to Singula, is a specialist in pay-TV subscriber management) &#8212; notes that Paysend has built both its processing and acquiring facilities. &#8220;Because we have built everything in-house it lets us see what the consumer needs and uses, and to deliver that at a lower cost basis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more cost efficient and we pass that savings on to the consumer. We designed our technology to be in complete control of it. It&#8217;s the most profitable approach, too, from a business point of view.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That being said, he confirmed that Paysend itself is not yet profitable, but investors believe it&#8217;s making the right moves to get there. And, to be clear, Paysend actually does partner with other companies, including those providing APIs, to improve its services. In April, <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/paysend-and-plaid-working-together-to-make-international-money-transfers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plaid and Paysend announced</a> they were working together to power open banking transfers, reducing the time to initiate and receive money.</p>
<p>“We are excited by Paysend’s enormous growth potential in a massive market, benefiting from a rapid acceleration in the adoption of digital payments,&#8221; said Humbert de Liedekerke, managing partner at One Peak Partners, in a statement. &#8220;In particular, we are seeing strong opportunities as Paysend moves beyond consumers to serve business customers and expands its international footprint to address a growing need for fast, easy and low-cost cross border digital payments. Paysend has built an exceptional payment platform by maintaining an unwavering focus on its customers and constantly innovating. We are excited to back the entire Paysend team in their next phase of explosive growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As of now, one fo the UK’s biggest and most active tech VCs has a new partner. Principal Colin Hanna has spearheaded several of Balderton’s deals in the past couple of years, and has now been appointed a Partner. But there’s a twist to this plot. He will be officially based in Berlin (where he’s lived since 2019), thus giving the VC a more powerful reach, being based, as it is, solely in London.</p>
<p>Hanna said: “Having been with Balderton for five years, I am humbled to now call my mentors my Partners. I look forward to strengthening Balderton’s unique approach from Berlin as we engineer serendipity for European founders with planet-scale ambition.”</p>
<p>Bernard Liautaud, Managing Partner of Balderton commented: &#8220;We are delighted to announce Colin&#8217;s promotion to Partner. Since he joined Balderton in 2016, Colin has had a significant impact on both Balderton and our portfolio… Colin has strengthened our position in DACH by establishing our permanent presence in Berlin and bringing in Shikha Ahluwalia, whom we are delighted to have. In addition, he was instrumental in the definition of the Balderton Sustainable Future Goals. We have no doubt Colin will be highly successful in his new role.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The story does not end there, however. Joining him will be tech entrepreneur and founder Shikha Ahluwalia as an Associate covering the DACH region.</p>
<p>co-founded SBL, the D2C women’s fashion e-commerce company in India. Prior to that she was had a tech advisory boutique, and was previously with JP Morgan’s Investment Banking Division in London.</p>
<p>Balderton has 10 current investments across DACH including Contentful, Infarm, SOPHiA Genetics, McMakler, Demodesk, and vivenu.</p>
<p>Ahluwalia commented: “Over the past few years, I have seen the DACH start-up ecosystem evolve rapidly. We at Balderton believe the next European giant will be a technology company and know that the DACH ecosystem plays a significant role in helping form category-leading technology companies. As a former founder myself, I have first-hand experience with the unique challenges of running young businesses. I am excited to contribute and support founders on their own journey as part of Balderton Capital.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me over an interview Hanna said: “Shikha’s hiring deepens our commitment to the local Berlin ecosystem and to the DACH region more broadly. We have been actively supporting Founders in Germany for more than a decade.&#8221;</p>
<p>After spending his childhood in Jakarta and Hong Kong, and picking up a degree in Political Economy, Hanna has carved out a career in venture investing &#8211; at Balderton since July 4, 2016 &#8211; looking at it through the prism on the rise of urban living, grassroots-driven technologies like open source and crypto, and the political ramifications of technology.</p>
<p>He sits on the Board of companies like e-bikes startup VanMoof, Finoa (a crypto custodian), Rahko (quantum computing drug discovery, and helped lead on investments into Traefik and Luno and Vivenu).</p>
<p>One these you might pick up from all those is that they err towards the ‘purpose-driven’ side of the equation.</p>
<p>He told me: &#8220;I believe the next generation of Founders, particularly in Europe, care more about just their bank accounts and want to build companies that generate impact and are not afraid to take a view on how they want the world to change. Measuring this is a challenge and something we are trying to do with our SFGs at Balderton which I helped spearhead. I believe that when companies like Coinbase and others go &#8220;apolitical&#8221; they commit themselves to defending the structural status quo rather than becoming agents of deliberate change.”</p>
<p>&#8220;My point about purpose driven companies is that when I think when employees want to work with companies believe in their values and you try to tell them those aren&#8217;t important, that could be viewed as political. I don&#8217;t think we should be we should be muffling the employees.”</p>
<p>Does he think Coinbase, and also recent more recently Basecamp / 37 Signals were wrong to so-called ‘depoliticize&#8217; their businesses?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, I think every CEO is free to run their company how they see fit. But I think that that poses challenges for them on the talent side. I understand, as an American, how charged and how destructive the political climate became, and so I can really understand and empathize why certain choices were made at that time, because you get to a point where that where the conversation becomes toxic… I hope that the steps that they&#8217;ve taken, don&#8217;t strangle dialogue and conversation that&#8217;s constructive about how we want to make an impact and change the world, either as individuals or with the companies we work for,” he said.</p>
<p>Hanna also told me that he think VCs should be wary that the shift to remote will make it easier to invest more widely. “You have to more background checks on founders now, and things like that. But is it a &#8216;little bit&#8217; more dangerous or is it &#8216;50% more dangerous&#8217; the fact that people aren&#8217;t meeting up in person?”</p>
