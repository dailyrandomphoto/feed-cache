										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors and AT&amp;T will be rolling out 5G connectivity in select Chevy, Cadillac and GMC vehicles from model year 2024, in a boost that the two companies say will bring more reliable software updates, faster navigation and downloads, and better coverage on roadways.</p>
<p>Executives said in a media briefing that the rollout of the 5G architecture will also bring benefits for GM models that are 4G LTE-equipped, such as those from model year 2019 and newer. Once available, vehicle owners of select models “will easily migrate to the new network infrastructure once available,” the companies said in a news release.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s going to be a performance boost and improvements as AT&amp;T improves their infrastructure, so that the vehicles connected with 4G capabilities, model year 19 and beyond, they will also start to perceive an improvement in their performance,” GM’s VP of global connected services, Santiago Chamorro, said during a media briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>5G technology has generated a lot of hype for its promises to boost speed and reduce latency across a range of industries, a next-gen tech that everyone thought would change the world far sooner than now. That hasn’t happened (yet), in part because network rollout was much slower than people anticipated. So this announcement can be taken as a clear signal that, at the very least, AT&amp;T thinks its 5G network will be mature enough to handle “millions” of connected vehicles by 2024.</p>
<p>Tom DeMaria, GM’s executive director of global connected services, added that the performance boost will not require GM pushing a significant software update to vehicles, but that the vehicles will be “seamlessly migrated.”</p>
<p>Faster and more reliable connectivity is key to many automakers’ market plans, which nearly across the board involve complex in-car software features and wireless over-the-air updates to keep everything from the music system to (if it’s an electric vehicle) the battery operational. It will also be key for other technologies like advanced driver assistance systems, which are swiftly becoming another key way that automakers seek to distinguish themselves to drivers.</p>

<p>General Motors has been developing what it calls <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/">Super Cruise</a>, a suite of SAE Level 2 features that can temporarily take over the vehicle providing certain conditions are met, and the driver stays alert at all times. Think of it as GM’s answer to Tesla’s Autopilot, another system that is by no means “self-driving.” This tech, plus things like infotainment, all operate under the umbrella of what GM calls its vehicle intelligence platform, the underlying hardware architecture.</p>
<p>“Network connectivity is an enabler that complements really well with what GM is doing in terms of its hardware and its software,” Chamorro added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The push for renewable energy has brought offshore wind power to the forefront of many an energy company&#8217;s agenda, and that means taking a very close look at the ocean floor where the installations are to go. Fortunately <a href="https://www.bedrockocean.com/">Bedrock</a> is here to drag that mapping process into the 21st century with its autonomous underwater vehicle and modern cloud-based data service.</p>
<p>The company aims to replace the standard &#8220;big ship with a big sonar&#8221; approach with a faster, smarter, more modern service, letting companies spin up regular super-accurate seafloor imagery as easily as they might spin up a few servers to host their website.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe we&#8217;re the first cloud-native platform for seafloor data,&#8221; said Anthony DiMare, CEO and cofounder (with CTO Charlie Chiau) of Bedrock. &#8220;This is a big data problem — how would you design the systems to support that solution? We make it a modern data service, instead of like a huge marine operation — you&#8217;re not tied to this massive piece of infrastructure floating in the water. Everything from the way we move sonars around the ocean to the way we deliver the data to engineers has been rethought.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zvlftUI4Vv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/ocean-floor-mapping-robotics-startup-bedrock-announces-an-8m-raise/">Ocean floor mapping robotics startup Bedrock announces an $8M raise</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ocean floor mapping robotics startup Bedrock announces an $8M raise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/ocean-floor-mapping-robotics-startup-bedrock-announces-an-8m-raise/embed/#?secret=zvlftUI4Vv" data-secret="zvlftUI4Vv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The product Bedrock provides customers is high-resolution maps of the seafloor, made available via Mosaic, a familiar web service that does all the analysis and hosting for you — a big step forward for an industry where &#8220;data migration&#8221; still means &#8220;shipping a box of hard drives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Normally, DiMare explained, this data was collected, processed, and stored on the ships themselves. Since they were designed to do everything from harbor inspections to deep sea surveys, they couldn&#8217;t count on having a decent internet connection, and the data is useless in its raw form. Like any other bulky data, it needs to be visualized and put in context.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190870" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190870" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190870" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg" alt="Example of data in the Mosaic system from Bedrock, showing a map and trails of data points." width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg 1826w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-1.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190870" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bedrock</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;These datasets are extremely large, tens of terabytes in size,&#8221; said DiMare. &#8220;Typical cloud systems aren&#8217;t the best way to manage 20,000 sonar files.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current market is more focused on detailed, near-shore data than the deep sea, since there&#8217;s a crush to take part in the growing wind energy market. This means that data is collected much closer to ordinary internet infrastructure and can be handed off for cloud-based processing and storage more easily than before. That in turn means the data can be processed and provided faster, just in time for demand to take off.</p>
<p>As DiMare explained, while there may have been a seafloor survey done in the last couple decades of a potential installation site, that&#8217;s only the first step. An initial mapping pass might have be made to confirm the years-old maps and add detail, then another for permitting, for environmental assessments, engineering, construction, and regular inspections. If this could be done with a turnkey automated process that produced even better results than crewed ships for less money, it&#8217;s a huge win for customers relying on old methods. And if the industry grows as expected to require more active monitoring of the seafloor along every U.S. coast, it&#8217;s a win for Bedrock as well, naturally.</p>

<p>To make this all happen, of course, you need a craft that can collect the data in the first place. &#8220;The AUV is a piece of technology we built solely to enable a data product,&#8221; said DiMare, but noted that, originally, &#8220;we didn&#8217;t want to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to spec out what it looked like to use an off the shelf system,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But if you want to build a hyper-scalable, very efficient system to get the best cost per square meter, you need a very specific set of features, certain sonars, the compute stack&#8230; by the time we listed all those we basically had a self-designed system. It&#8217;s faster, it&#8217;s more operationally flexible, you get better data quality, and you can do it more reliably.&#8221;</p>
<p>And amazingly, it doesn&#8217;t even need a boat — you can grab it from the back of a van and launch it from a pier or beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the very beginning one of the restrictions we put on ourselves was &#8216;no boats.&#8217; And we need to be able to fly with this thing. That totally changed our approach,&#8221; said DiMare.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190869" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190869" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190869" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg" alt="View of the AUV on a beach" width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=1536,1033 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=2048,1377 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bedrock-4.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190869" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bedrock</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The AUV packs a lot into a small package, and while the sensor loadout is variable depending on the job, one aspect that defines the craft is its high-frequency sonar.</p>
<p>Sonars operate in a wide range of frequencies, from the hundreds to the hundreds of thousands of hertz. Unfortunately that means that ocean-dwelling creatures, many of which can hear in that range, are inundated with background noise, sometimes to the point where it&#8217;s harmful or deters them from entering an area. Sonar operating about 200 kHz is safe for animals, but the high frequency means the signal attenuates more quickly, reducing the range to 50-75 meters.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s obviously worthless for a ship floating on the surface — much of what it needs to map is more than 75 meters deep. But if you could make a craft that always stayed within 50 meters of the seabed, it&#8217;s full of benefits. And that&#8217;s exactly what Bedrock&#8217;s AUV is designed to do.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwxPzQKd3ig?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The increased frequency of the sonar also means increased detail, so the picture its instruments paint is better than what you&#8217;d get with a larger wave. And because it&#8217;s safe to use around animals, you can skip the (very necessary but time-consuming) red tape at wildlife authorities. Better, faster, cheaper, <em>and</em> safer is a hell of a pitch.</p>
<p>Today marks the official launch of Mosaic, and to promote adoption Bedrock is offering 50 gigs of free storage — of any kind of compatible map data, since the platform is format-agnostic.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a ton of data out there that&#8217;s technically &#8220;public&#8221; but is nevertheless very difficult to find and use. It may be a low-detail survey from two decades ago, or a hyper-specific scan of an area investigated by a research group, but if it were all in one place it would probably be a lot more useful, DiMare said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately we want to get where we can do the whole ocean on a yearly basis,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve got a lot of work to do.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer shift to buying online during the global pandemic — and keeping that habit — continues to boost revenue for makers of developer tools that help e-commerce sites provide better shopping experiences.</p>
<p>LA-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/nacelle-raises-4-8m-for-its-headless-e-commerce-platform/">Nacelle</a> is one of the e-commerce infrastructure companies continuing to attract investor attention, and at a speedy clip, too. It closed on a $50 million Series B round from Tiger Global. This is just six months after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/e-commerce-infrastructure-startup-nacelle-closes-18m-series-a/">$18 million Series A</a> round, led by Inovia, and follows a $4.8 million seed round in 2020.</p>
<p>The company is working in “headless” commerce, which means it is disconnecting the front end of a website, a.k.a. the storefront, from the back end, where all of the data lives, to create a better shopping experience, CEO Brian Anderson told TechCrunch. By doing this, the back end of the store, essentially where all the magic happens, can be updated and maintained without changing the front end.</p>
<p>“Online shopping is not new, but how the customer relates to it keeps changing,” he said. “The technology for online shopping is not up to snuff — when you click on something, everything has to reload compared to an app like Instagram.”</p>

<p>More people shopping on their mobile devices creates friction due to downloading an app for each brand. That is “sucking the fun out of shopping online,” because no one wants that many apps on their phone, Anderson added.</p>
<p>Steven Kramer, board member and former EVP of Hybris, said via email that over the past two decades, the e-commerce industry went through several waves of innovation. Now, maturing consumer behaviors and expectations are accelerating the current phase.</p>
<p>“Retailers and brands are struggling with adopting the latest technologies to meet today’s requirements of agility, speed and user experience,” Kramer added. “Nacelle gives organizations a future-proof way to accelerate their innovation, leverage existing investments and do so with material ROI.”</p>
<p>Data already shows that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/">COVID-era trends accelerated e-commerce by roughly five years</a>, and Gartner predicts that <a href="https://commercelayer.io/docs/core-concepts/composable-commerce">50% of new commerce capabilities will be incorporated as API-centric SaaS services</a> by 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those kinds of trends are bringing in competitors that are also attracting investor attention — for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/shopistry-bags-2m-to-provide-headless-commerce-without-the-headaches/">Shopistry</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/">Swell</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/fabric-series-a/">Fabric</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/italys-commerce-layer-raises-16m-led-by-coatue-for-its-headless-commerce-platform/">Commerce Layer</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/vue-storefront/">Vue Storefront</a> are just a few of the companies that raised funding this year alone.</p>
<p>Anderson notes that the market continues to be hot and one that can’t be ignored, especially as the <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf">share of online retail sales grows</a>. He explained that some of his competitors force customers to migrate off of their current tech stack and onto their respective platforms so that their users can get a good customer experience. In contrast, Nacelle enables customers to keep their tech stack and put components together as they see fit.</p>
<p>“That is painful in any vertical, but especially for e-commerce,” he said. “That is your direct line to revenue.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nacelle itself grew 690% in the past year in terms of revenue, and customers are signing multiyear contracts, Anderson said.</p>
<p>Anderson, who is an engineer by trade, wants to sink his teeth into new products as adoption of headless commerce grows. These include providing a dynamic layer of functionality on top of the tech stack for storefronts that are traditionally static, and even introducing some livestream capabilities later this year.</p>
<p>As such, Nacelle will invest the new round into its go-to-market strategy and expand its customer success, partner relations and product development. He said Nacelle is already “the de facto standard” for Shopify Plus merchants going headless.</p>
<p>“We want to put everything in a tailor-made API for e-commerce that lets front-end developers do their thing with ease,” Anderson added. “We also offer starter kits for merchants as a starting point to get up-and-running.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Shared micromobility company Bird has unveiled a new consumer e-bike. This is the first time the company is selling private vehicles rather than relying on the shared model.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s calling the bike the &#8220;Bird Bike,&#8221; which is the same name it&#8217;s using for the recently released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/">shared e-bike the company launched in June</a>. As with the shared model, the bike is designed in-house, but Bird did not identify the manufacturing partner. Limited quantities of the bike, in Stealth Black and Gravity Gray, are available starting Thursday for $2,299. Bird did not specify which markets it would deliver the initial order of the e-bike to, but it hopes to make the bike broadly available from U.S. retailers this fall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The electric bike market is expected to hit nearly<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/08/02/2272822/0/en/Electric-Bike-Market-E-Bike-Size-Share-to-Hit-Value-of-USD-67-96-Billion-by-2026-Facts-Factors.html"> $68 billion by 2026</a>, whereas the bike-share market is only expected to hit around<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/868126/global-bikesharing-market-size/"> $13.8 billion</a> by the same year, which might point to the financial reasoning behind Bird&#8217;s announcement.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/"> Bird&#8217;s SPAC filing in May</a> revealed massively unprofitable revenues and resulting net losses, so the company appears to be trying to diversify its business lines and leverage its position as a household name in micromobility so that it can stand a chance at profitability.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new e-bike is part of Bird&#8217;s consumer products portfolio which represents about 10% of its business, according to Bird&#8217;s S-4 SEC filing, but the company did not respond to requests for explanations as to why it&#8217;s decided to launch a consumer business. That said, this is not the first time Bird has tried to branch out. Back in 2019, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/bird-announces-monthly-scooter-subscription">Bird announced a monthly e-scooter subscription service</a>, but that never got the chance to take off.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The future of transportation is all-electric. By expanding Bird’s consumer and shared products to include e-bikes as well as e-scooters, we are uniquely positioned to lead the revolution to eco-friendly transportation for the billions of annual trips that are five miles or less,” said Travis VanderZanden, Bird&#8217;s founder and CEO, in a statement. “With our new e-bike, we are creating increased opportunities for people to embrace micro electric vehicles beyond the 300 cities we partner with to provide our shared services today. Our e-bike is safe, durable and provides a stylish aesthetic and advanced technology that delivers a fun alternative to congestion-inducing, gas-powered cars.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bird&#8217;s e-bike, which is about the same price as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/vanmoof-x3-review-e-bike/">VanMoof X3,</a> has a 12.8 Ah battery, powered by LG cells, that delivers up to 50 miles of range, the company says. The bike will be available in both a step-through and step-over aluminum alloy frame, and it will come with Kenda puncture-resistant tires. The pedal assist allows for speeds up to 20 miles per hour, and a thumb throttle is there for those pesky inclines. An LCD panel under the handlebars displays speed, distance and battery capacity, and bluetooth connectivity to the Bird app allows riders to turn the LED lights on and off, view battery range and miles ridden.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Metabase spun out of venture studio Expa as an easy way for people to interact with datasets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open-source business intelligence company <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> announced Thursday a $30 million Series B round led by Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Existing investors Expa and NEA joined in on the round, which gives the San Francisco-based company a total of $42.5 million in funding since it was founded in 2015. Metabase previously raised <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/metabase-an-open-source-business-analytics-startup-closes-8-million-2019-4">$8 million in Series A funding</a> back in 2019, led by NEA.</p>
<p>Metabase was developed within venture studio Expa and spun out as an easy way for people to interact with data sets, co-founder and CEO Sameer Al-Sakran told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“When someone wants access to data, they may not know what to measure or how to use it, all they know is they have the data,” Al-Sakran said. “We provide a self-service access layer where they can ask a question, Metabase scans the data and they can use the results to build models, create a dashboard and even slice the data in ways they choose without having an analyst build out the database.”</p>
<p>He notes that not much has changed in the business intelligence realm since Tableau came out more than 15 years ago, and that computers can do more for the end user, particularly to understand what the user is going to do. Increasingly, open source is the way software and information wants to be consumed, especially for the person that just wants to pull the data themselves, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>George Mathew, managing director of Insight Partners, believes we are seeing the third generation of business intelligence tools emerging following centralized enterprise architectures like SAP, then self-service tools like Tableau and Looker and now companies like Metabase that can get users to discovery and insights quickly.</p>
<p>“The third generation is here and they are leading the charge to insights and value,” Mathew added. “In addition, the world has moved to the cloud, and BI tools need to move there, too. This generation of open source is a better and greater example of all three of those.”</p>
<p>To date, Metabase has been downloaded 98 million times and used by more than 30,000 companies across 200 countries. The company pursued another round of funding after building out a commercial offering, Metabase Enterprise, that is doing well, Al-Sakran said.</p>
<p>The new funding round enables the company to build out a sales team and continue with product development on both Metabase Enterprise and Metabase Cloud. Due to Metabase often being someone’s first business intelligence tool, he is also doubling down on resources to help educate customers on how to ask questions and learn from their data.</p>
<p>“Open source has changed from floppy disks to projects on the cloud, and we think end users have the right to see what they are running,” Al-Sakran said. “We are continuing to create new features and improve performance and overall experience in efforts to create the BI system of the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most startup origin stories don&#8217;t begin on an NFL field, but that&#8217;s where founder, CEO and offensive tackle Jason Fox conceptualized the idea behind <a href="https://www.earbudsmusic.com/">Earbuds</a>. As he watched first overall draft pick Cam Newton warm up before a game in 2011, dancing to music, Fox couldn&#8217;t help but wonder what the future NFL MVP was listening to &#8212; and he bet that the crowd of 85,000 fans were curious too.</p>
<p>Ten years later, Earbuds has raised a $3 million Series A round for its social listening app, led by Ecliptic Capital with additional investment from the Andre Agassi Foundation and LFG Ventures.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/earbuds-lets-audiences-stream-the-playlists-of-athletes-entertainers-and-each-other/">its launch in 2019</a>, Earbuds has allowed users &#8212; whether they&#8217;re famous artists, NFL stars or ordinary people &#8212; to share their favorite playlists, livestream music like a DJ and comment on other people&#8217;s music picks. Some notable figures on the app include the artist Nelly and professional quarterbacks like Baker Mayfield and Patrick Mahomes, the <a href="https://www.nfl.com/photos/ranking-the-nfl-s-biggest-contracts-for-2021">highest-paid player</a> in the NFL. Mayfield and Mahomes are also investors in the app.</p>
<p>With this recent raise, Fox and his team of six plan to expand the app to add creator monetization tools, incentivizing people to use the app. Plus, Earbuds also announced that it hired two former product and engineering leaders from Apple, David Ransom and Sean Moubry, who joined Earbuds as head of Product and head of Engineering, respectively. Tech veteran Drew Larner also came aboard as a senior advisor and investor &#8212; in 2015, he sold the streaming app Rdio to Pandora. Pandora was then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/siriusxm-to-acquire-pandora-for-3-5-billion/">sold to Sirius XM for $3.5 billion</a> in 2018.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191335" style="width: 408px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191335" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2191335" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?w=398" alt="" width="398" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=88,150 88w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=176,300 176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=398,680 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_7793.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191335" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Earbuds&#8217; interface allows users to search for athlete accounts/Earbuds.</p></div></p>
<p>To use Earbuds, users must have a paid account on Spotify or Apple Music. Soon, Fox says, Earbuds should have integrations with paid versions of Amazon Music and Pandora, too. These integrations are how the app, available on both iOS and Android, is able to source music for streaming. But regardless of which platform a listener uses, they can still take advantage of the social features on Earbuds, listening along to live playlists and commenting along with other listeners.</p>
<p>When you connect your account, you&#8217;re able to easily import your existing playlists. Then, on the app, you can add voice clips to comment on your song choices. When listening to a stream, users have the option to save the playlist to their streaming service or share it as an Instagram story.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fox declined to share monthly active user numbers, but expressed confidence that soliciting users from other streaming platforms&#8217; existing subscriber base won&#8217;t be a big hurdle for user acquisition; when it comes to paid streaming music subscribers, Spotify has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/podcasts-focus-spotify-user-growth/">165 million users</a>, Apple Music has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">at least 60 million</a> and Amazon music has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/amazon-music-passes-55m-customers-across-its-free-and-paid-tiers-but-still-lags-behind-spotify-and-apple/">at least 55 million</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to continue to add additional streaming partners to accommodate everyone. We want to connect with all users regardless of what platform they use,&#8221; Fox said.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Fox wants more musical artists to use the app, but given his background as an NFL player, much of the company&#8217;s existing marketing has been targeted toward athletes and sports fans &#8212; a particularly interesting potential market for Earbuds is NCAA athletes, who are </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/how-college-athletes-can-make-money-according-to-new-ncaa-nil-policy.html">newly able to monetize</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> their image and likeness. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the quarterback before the big rivalry game, and they want to be able to monetize the fans while they&#8217;re listening to music and getting amped up with them before the game,&#8221; Fox explained.</p>
<p>Since these monetization tools haven&#8217;t rolled out yet, there&#8217;s currently no in-app purchases available on Earbuds. This would give Earbuds, which isn&#8217;t yet profitable, another income stream. So far, the app has made money through in-app sponsored posts from partners like the NBA, the NFL playoffs, smart speaker companies and beverage companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can continue to do that, but we feel like the majority of growth and revenue moving forward will be through partnerships, integrations and supporting the creator economy,&#8221; Fox said. Currently, Earbuds has a partnership with Apple Music, so if someone subscribes to the platform via Earbuds, Earbuds gets a cut of their subscription payment.</p>
<p>As streaming services like Spotify grow, social listening apps like Earbuds are emerging too. Spotify itself has rolled out more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/">social listening features</a> lately, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/spotify-expands-its-radio-dj-like-format-music-talk-to-global-creators/">Music + Talk</a> platform similar to Earbuds&#8217; existing offerings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fontinalis.com/">Fontinalis Partners</a>, a 12-year-old, Detroit-based venture firm that was among the earliest early-stage venture outfits to focus squarely on mobility, has collected $104 million in capital commitments for its third and newest fund.</p>
<p>Investors in the vehicle include Ford Motor Corp., whose executive chairman, Bill Ford, cofounded Fontinalis and continues to help manage the fund. It also collected commitments from roughly 30 other limited partners, ranging from corporate partners in the automotive and insurance industries to family offices.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s interpretation of mobility as pertaining to any startup that &#8220;enables efficient movement&#8221; has resulted in a wide range of bets. Fontinalis had nabbed a stake in Postmates, for example, which was acquired last year in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">all-stock deal</a> by Uber. It wrote a check to Lyft,  and helped fund the self-driving startup nuTonomy, which sold to auto supplier Delphi Automotive in 2017 for $450 million.</p>
<p>It has also more recently funded <a href="https://gatik.ai/">Gatik</a>, a startup developing an autonomous vehicle stack for B2B short-haul logistics; <a href="https://www.robust.ai/">Robust.AI</a>, a startup at work on an industrial-grade cognitive platform for robots; <a href="https://www.helm.ai/">Helm.ai</a>, a maker of driverless car AI; and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/freightwaves-raises-16m-for-new-sustainability-platform/">FreightWaves</a>, a data and content startup that aims to provide participants in the freight wave industry with near-time analytics.</p>
<p>Altogether, the firm has invested in roughly 55 companies, and it says that 20 of them have already seen exits, including the family tracking app Life360, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-life360-ipo-australia/u-s-family-tracking-app-life360-launches-104-million-australian-ipo-idUSKCN1RU0AF">went public</a> on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2019, and lidar sensor manufacturer Ouster, which became <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210312005256/en/Ouster-to-Begin-Trading-on-the-New-York-Stock-Exchange-Today-Under-Ticker-Symbol-%E2%80%9COUST%E2%80%9D">publicly traded in March</a> in the U.S. by merging with a blank-check company.</p>
<p>As for the size of its newest fund &#8212; which is roughly the same size as the firm&#8217;s $100 million second fund &#8212; there&#8217;s a reason Fontinalis hasn&#8217;t raised a much larger vehicle (no pun intended) unlike other investors who&#8217;ve been routinely doubling their fund sizes every couple of years.</p>
<p>As Fontinalis cofounder Chris Cheever and longtime partner Chris Stallman tell it, Fontinalis could be investing more dollars (and making more money in management fees). Instead, their team sees their job as finding the best deals within their mandate, then, after funding those companies, opening up more opportunities for the firm&#8217;s limited partners to directly co-invest alongside the firm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have a number of LPs in this fund that have a pretty considerable appetite for co-investment opportunities,&#8221; says Stallman,&#8221;so there&#8217;s a lot of flexibility for us to scale up through them.&#8221; Adds Cheever of the network Fontinalis brings to deals, &#8220;Many of these parties could be key customers that startups are looking to access, but also simply be their partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fontinalis now has $270 million in assets under management. Cheever and Stallman say it has already made five investments in Series A-stage or later companies out of its newest fund; it has also written separate checks to six seed-stage companies.</p>
<p>Among its newest bets is an additive manufacturing company that has not publicly disclosed the round yet. It also recently wrote a follow-on check into <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/on-heels-of-253m-raise-highland-electric-lands-biggest-electric-school-bus-contract-in-the-u.s">Highland Electric</a>, a company that&#8217;s focused on helping school systems adopt electric buses by helping them up grade their infrastructure, manage their charging, train their drivers and providing them with financing options for the buses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Founders JT Garwood and Jack Miller started Bttn after seeing the challenges medical organizations had during the global pandemic to not only find supplies, but also get fair prices for them.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coming off a $1.5 million seed round in June, <a href="https://bttnusa.com/">bttn.</a> announced Thursday that it secured another $5 million extension, led by FUSE, to the round to give it a $26.5 million post-money valuation.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based company was founded in March 2021 by JT Garwood and Jack Miller after seeing the challenges medical organizations had during the global pandemic to not only find supplies, but also get fair prices for them.</p>
<p>“We went into this building on the pain points customers had dealing with a system that is so archaic and outdated — most were still faxing in order forms and keeping closets full of supplies, but not knowing what was there,” Garwood, CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bttn. is going after the <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/medical-supplies-wholesaling-united-states/">U.S. wholesale medical supply market</a>, which is predicted to be valued at $243.3 billion by the end of 2021, according to IBISWorld. The company created a business-to-business e-commerce platform with a variety of high-quality medical supplies, saving customers an average of between 20% and 40%, while providing a better ordering and shipping experience, Garwood said.</p>
<p>It now boasts more than 300 customers, including individual practices and surgical centers, and multiple government contracts. It is also currently the preferred supplier for over 17 healthcare associations across the country, Garwood said. In addition to expanding into dental supplies, bttn. is also attracting customers like senior living facilities and home and hospice care.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Garwood intends to use the funds to expand bttn.’s technology, sales and operations teams, and increase its partnerships. The company is also adding new features like a portal to track shipments more easily, better order automation and improve the ability to control when supplies will get to them.</p>
<p>Bttn. is also analyzing more of the data coming in from its marketplace to recognize where the trends are coming from, including hospitalization rates, to share with customers. For example, if hospitals are overcrowded, supply shortages will follow, Garwood said.</p>
<p>“The medical supply industry was built on inequity, and we have a sense of duty to build a product that enables a better future for our customers,” he added. “We can proactively let customers know that spikes are expected, provide them with correct information and give that power back to the consumers and healthcare providers in ways they never had before.”</p>
<p>Whereas bttn.’s first seed round was “about pouring gas on the fire,” partnering with FUSE this time around was an easy decision for Garwood, who said the firm is bringing new assets to the table.</p>
<p>Brendan Wales, general partner at FUSE, said via email that his firm backs promising entrepreneurs building businesses in the Pacific Northwest and discovered bttn. before they announced any funding.</p>
<p>He said there is massive consumerization of healthcare, most evident on the patient side for years, but now becoming so on the provider side. Medical office employees are looking for the same type of customer experience they get from online businesses they frequently shop at, and bttn. “has a relentless drive to provide the same type of experiences and interactions to health providers.”</p>
<p>“We fell in love with the idea of providing a transparent and delightful customer experience to health providers, something that has been sorely lacking,” Wales added. “That, tied in with a young and ambitious team, made it so that our entire partnership worked tirelessly to partner with them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May 2020, a trio of friends rented a home in Tulum, Mexico and invited their internet friends. The project was dubbed The Launch House, and the 18 entrepreneurs who came to live there had to do the following: pay rent, launch projects, and build their company in public. Other homes began popping across the world around the same time, as a nod to old school hacker homes<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/founders-hacker-hype-homes-remote-work/"> but built for the remote work era of the coronavirus. </a></p>
<p>Over a year later,<a href="https://www.launchhouse.co/"> Launch House</a> has expanded its physical and digital presence beyond a one-off project. The trio &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/callmehouck">Michael Houck</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thatguyBG">Brett Goldstein</a> and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobdpeters/"> Jacob Peters</a> &#8211; announced that they’ve raised $3 million to expand their residency program, physically and digitally. Next fall, Launch House will launch LA and NYC-specific programs, as well as residencies built to gather people within Web 3.0, fintech, B2B enterprise, and the creator economy.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by Flybridge Capital Partners, with participation from Day One Ventures and Graph Ventures. More than 100 angel investors also put money into the company as well, including 60 early Launch House members and notable techies including Alexia Bonatsos, Balaji Srinivasan and Mike Duboe.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startup founders set up hacker homes to recreate Silicon Valley synergy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/founders-hacker-hype-homes-remote-work/embed/#?secret=mKwHFhOoly" data-secret="mKwHFhOoly" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>Tulum to now </strong></h2>
<p>Since its Tulum origins, Launch House has grown to focus on a more cohort-based approach. Entrepreneurs are invited to take up a 4-week, live-in residency at Paris Hilton’s former Beverly Hills Mansion, which the company has rented out. To date, over 200 people across 8 cohorts have gone through the Launch House to bring their ideas to the seed stage.</p>
<p>Here’s where it goes beyond the traditional hacker home. The in-person residencies are viewed as on-boarding events into the broader Launch House community, which includes digital and physical events, services that help with scaling startups, and in-house social networks. Houck, a former product manager at Airbnb, is working on a service that allows Launch House community members to invite other members to stay at their homes for residency.</p>
<p>While the company&#8217;s next chapter, dubbed Season 2 will include new sector-based houses in New York and Los Angeles, the team stressed a bigger focus on digital spaces. While describing the transition of offline communities into online ones, Goldstein gave the metaphor of religion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There are tons of important religious sites in the world, like Mecca and The Wailing Wall, but you can be a good member of that religion without going to those places &#8211; and actually, most people don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. The co-founder thinks the same can be said of Launch House participants, who maybe never step foot in a home but are active members of the community virtually.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“We see ourselves less as a hacker home and more as a venture-scaled membership community,” Goldstein said. “These physical [spaces] are just an initial wedge to drive deep connections.” The company’s bet, therefore, is that it can help spin out enough successful startups that its name has the signal of a prestigious program &#8211; and thus get more members as its brand grows.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="spYj1ix60B"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">Virtual HQs race to win over a remote-work-fatigued market</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Virtual HQs race to win over a remote-work-fatigued market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/embed/#?secret=spYj1ix60B" data-secret="spYj1ix60B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While most startups are at the early stage, some have begun to break out and go on to raise from Y Combinator, Sequoia, Village Global, and even Beyonce and Jay Z. Startups formed at the house include Showtime, Compose, Colabra, while others like Wombo and TagMango hit milestones and fundraising goals while participating in the home.</p>
<p>Unlike other early-stage accelerators like Y Combinator, Launch House doesn’t take equity in any of the startups that launch out of their community.</p>
<p>“Great founders have tons of options, and we think that in order to get people into your community you can&#8217;t demand equity upfront,” Goldstein said. “It&#8217;s kind of an antiquated model.” Instead, Launch House makes money through a membership-fee model. Live-in members are given a one year free membership to the community with residency costs, and then after that it is an annual subscription.</p>
<p><strong>‘10X better’ than WeWork</strong></p>
<p>The startup’s scale could be somewhat curbed if it only can grow through physical spaces, which is part of the reason it may be beginning to focus more on the digital world. WeWork, for example, gave many lessons, one of which was about how hard a business flexible office space truly is.</p>
<p>As for if the infamous real estate company tarnished investor interest in entrepreneur hubs, Peters pointed to Launch House’s lead investor in today’s round: Jesse Middleton of Flybridge Ventures. Middleton formerly built WeWork Labs, which the co-founders say give them a direct perspective on how to build in a “10X better” way than the nearly public company.</p>
<p>The other challenge for Launch House will be curating a diverse group of engaged community members, a struggle that every online community goes through.</p>
<p>The residency’s application process currently evaluates members on three categories: how exciting a person is as a founder, how exciting their company is, and how much benefit they would get from joining this community right now, which can range from stage of company to who else is in the cohort that month. Once the Launch House team goes through the cohort, a pool of 50 Launch House community members work as volunteers to interview the potential members. Finally, the co-founders do a final check before sending out offers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191484" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191484" loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2191484" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Horizontal-Hi-Res.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191484" class="wp-caption-text">Launch House co-founders</p></div></p>
<p>It’s an intensive process that, if not done intentionally, could limit who gets access to the Launch House by rewarding those who lean into each other’s echo-chambers. Launch House said that it has had cohorts in the past with 40% underrepresented founders, but that its current cohort is approximately 25% POC.</p>
<p>As the company grows its member base, it will have new pressures to deal with around diversity and making sure its customers are seeing themselves represented in the homes. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Houck explained that the company recently put together a Diversity Council that meets every few months to discuss new initiatives, which include creating a scholarship program to help candidates from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds afford the program. The program has dispersed $20,000 in 2 months. The company has also hired someone to form partnerships with underrepresented founder communities.</span></p>
<p>Launch House has raised money during a time where many of its potential customers are rethinking the work day, and life, they want. With fresh plans to expand, the startup has the opportunity to intentionally build a network that wouldn’t have existed in Silicon Valley before the pandemic &#8211; and will have ripple effects long after.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s journey toward making virtual reality a thing has been long and circuitous, but despite mixed success in finding a wide audience for VR, they have managed to build some very nice hardware along the way. What&#8217;s fairly ironic is that while Facebook has managed to succeed in finessing the hardware and operating system of its Oculus devices &#8212; things it had never done before &#8212; over the years it has struggled most with actually making a good app for VR.</p>
<p>The company has released a number of social VR apps over the years, and while each of them managed to do something right, none of them did anything quite well enough to stave off a shutdown. Setting aside the fact that most VR users don&#8217;t have a ton of other friends that also own VR headsets, the broadest issue plaguing these social apps was that they never really gave users a great reason to use them. While watching 360-videos or playing board games with friends were interesting gimmicks, it&#8217;s taken the company an awful lot of time to understand that a dedicated ”social” app doesn&#8217;t make much sense in VR and that users haven&#8217;t been looking for a standalone social app, so much as they&#8217;ve been looking for engaging experiences that were improved by social dynamics.</p>

<p>This all brings me to what Facebook showed me a demo of this week — a workplace app called Horizon Workrooms which is launching in open beta for Quest 2 users starting today.</p>
<p>The app seems to be geared towards providing work-from-home employees a virtual reality sphere to collaborate inside. Users can link their Mac or PC to Workrooms and livestream their desktop to the app while the Quest 2&#8217;s passthrough cameras allow users to type on their physical keyboard. Users can chat with one another as avatars and share photos and files or draw on a virtual whiteboard. It&#8217;s an app that would have made a more significant splash for the Quest 2 platform had it launched earlier in the pandemic, though it&#8217;s tackling an issue that still looms large among tech savvy offices &#8212; finding tech solutions to aid meaningful collaboration in a remote environment.</p>
<p>Horizon Workrooms isn&#8217;t a social app per se but the way it approaches social communication in VR is more thoughtful than any other first-party social VR app that Facebook has shipped. The spatial elements are less overt and gimmicky than most VR apps and simply add to an already great functional experience that, at times, felt more productive and engaging than a normal video call.</p>

<p>It all plays into CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s recent proclamation that Facebook is transitioning into becoming a &#8220;metaverse company.”</p>
<p>Now, what&#8217;s the metaverse? In Zuckerberg&#8217;s own words, “It’s a virtual environment where you can be present with people in digital spaces. You can kind of think of this as an embodied internet that you’re inside of rather than just looking at.” This certainly sounds like a fairly significant recalibration for Facebook, which has generally approached AR/VR as a wholly separate entity from its suite of mobile apps. Desktop users and VR users have been effectively siloed from each other over the years.</p>
<p>Generally, Facebook has been scaling Oculus like they&#8217;re building the next smartphone, building its headsets with a native app paradigm at their core. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg&#8217;s future-minded &#8220;metaverse&#8221; sounds much more like what Roblox has been building towards than anything Facebook has actually shipped. Horizon Workrooms is living under the Horizon brand which seems to be where Facebook’s future metaverse play is rooted. The VR social platform is interestingly still in closed beta after being announced nearly two years ago. If Facebook can ever see Horizon’s vision to fruition, it could grow to become a Roblox-like hub of user-created games, activities and groups that replaces the native app mobile dynamics with a more fluid social experience.</p>
<p>The polish of Workrooms is certainly a promising sign of where Facebook could be moving.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Needing to get your car fixed is like having a toothache: It’s painful, hard to ignore and likely means someone messing around under the hood. RepairSmith, launched in 2019, wants to make that process a little smoother through its mobile auto repair service that sends a mechanic right to the driver’s home.</p>
<p>The startup is already in seven states and now, with a new round of $42 million funding, is looking to grow its operations to encompass every major metropolitan area in the U.S. by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>“Fundamentally what we&#8217;re doing here is e-commerce plus logistics,” Milne said. “We&#8217;re trying to disrupt probably the biggest retail industry that&#8217;s untouched by tech.” RepairSmith aims to do so by letting customers book an appointment online and have a mechanic perform an inspection or repair from their driveway, a far cry from the conventional auto repair process.</p>
<p>RepairSmith was incepted at Mercedes-Benz’ incubator program, and the company’s first few funding rounds were furnished solely by the automaker. Now that RepairSmith has a solid footing in multiple metros, with the data to show it’s an attractive business, the company decided to bring in new investors TI Capital, Porsche Ventures and Spring Mountain Capital to the latest Series B, in addition to Mercedes.</p>
<p>“We built this business from the beginning to be multibrand as an industry solution,” RepairSmith CEO Joel Milne told TechCrunch in an interview. “While [Mercedes] seeded it, it was never meant to be a Mercedes solution. That was always the intent.”</p>
<p>Depending on the market, users can have a repair technician at their home in as little as one or two days. Milne said around 90% of appointments can be completed on-site. For those remaining 10% or so, the customer can either drive their car (or if it’s not drivable) have it towed to a network of auto body shops that have partnered with RepairSmith.</p>
<p>In some cases, the customer knows what is wrong with their car in advance, but when they don’t, RepairSmith schedules an inspection visit and generates a quote for the service after.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company launched focusing on the consumer market, but it’s also expanded to working with fleets, rental car agencies and dealerships. A little over a quarter of the company’s services are now B2B. “They’re both equally big markets and very attractive opportunities for us,” Milne said. “It&#8217;s really a function of, we focused on consumer first, but part of this capital raise [is] we&#8217;re aggressively growing out our B2B services.”</p>
<p>All RepairSmith technicians are also employees, rather than contractors, a decision that ultimately came down to wanting to attract top talent.</p>
<p>“We didn&#8217;t feel that we could be competitive in recruiting the quality of technicians we were looking for, not giving them standard employment terms. All technicians at repair shops are employees today, and that&#8217;s the market that we compete in for labor,” Milne said. He added that the company also didn’t want to have to deal with legal issues over what counts as a contractor versus employee.</p>
<p>The startup has big goals — entering all major metro markets by the end of next year, which doesn’t just include hiring more auto technicians but also continuing to improve the company’s software and logistics platform, which it built from the ground up. Milne demurred on whether it might need additional capital to get there. “Ultimately, if the market is good, we&#8217;ll be looking for further investment to grow, whether it&#8217;s internationally, whether it&#8217;s to grow our service offering. But this raise gets us a long way on the way there, depending on how fast we want to go.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has rolled out India’s first celebrity voice feature on Alexa with the nation’s biggest movie star Amitabh Bachchan as the company makes a push to lure more users in the world’s second-most populated nation.</p>
<p>The company, which rolled out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/alexa-gets-an-improved-voice-and-can-now-sound-like-samuel-l-jackson-too/">voice of Samuel Jackson on Alexa in the U.S. in 2019</a>, said users in India can add the Bollywood legend’s voice to their Echo devices or Amazon shopping app for an introductory price of 149 Indian rupees ($2) for the first year. (Starting second year, the annual price will move to $4.)</p>
<p>The 78-year-old actor is providing Amazon with stories from his life, a selection of poems from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harivansh_Rai_Bachchan">his father</a>, tongue twisters, and motivational quotes. Amazon customers can also ask Alexa to play music, set alarms, get weather updates and get answers in Bachchan’s signature style.</p>
<p>And the company said it is also applying neural speech technology to make Alexa sound like Bachchan even if there&#8217;s no direct pre-recording. (Amit ji, remind me to ask you about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/india-orders-investigation-into-alleged-anti-competitive-practices-by-amazon-and-walmarts-flipkart/">Amazon&#8217;s antitrust situation in India</a> later today.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191491" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191491" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191491 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1473" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=150,147 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=300,295 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=768,754 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=680,668 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/amitabh-bachchan-alexa-amazon.jpg?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191491" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>“Working with Amazon to introduce my voice on Alexa was a new experience in bringing together the magic of voice technology and artistic creativity. I am excited that my well-wishers can now interact with me via this new medium, and looking forward to hear how they feel about this,” said Bachchan in a statement.</p>
<p>A household name, Bachchan emerged as Bollywood’s top star in the 1970s playing characters who battled corruption and social injustice. He has also done scores of advertisements for brands and initiatives from everything including hair oil, biscuits, cold drinks, jewelry, state tourism, banks to UNICEF-backed polio vaccination campaign.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company announced its collaboration with Bollywood legend last year. But the pandemic forced Amazon&#8217;s engineering teams to work remotely for this project. There were also additional complications. Globally, users can trigger Alexa with one-word wake alert. Alexa, do this, for instance. But in case of Bachchan, Amazon has introduce a two-word wake system to Alexa. &#8220;Amit ji.&#8221; (Where &#8216;ji&#8217; is a Hindi word to pay respect.)</p>
<p>“At Amazon &amp; Alexa, we consistently innovate on behalf of our customers and building the Amitabh Bachchan celebrity voice experience with one of India’s most iconic voices has been a labor of love. Creating the world’s first bi-lingual celebrity voice required us to invent &amp; re-invent across almost every element of speech science – wake word, speech recognition, neural text-to-speech and more,” said Puneesh Kumar, Country Leader for Alexa, Amazon India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“While we are proud of the many India-first innovations and desi-delighters in this, it’s still Day 1 and we will continue to enrich this experience as science evolves.”</p>
<p>India is a key overseas market for Amazon, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">deployed over $6.5 billion</a> and is increasingly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/amazon-backs-indian-wealth-management-service-smallcase-in-40-million-funding/">making investment in startups</a>. This isn&#8217;t the first time the company has signed up Bachchan for one of its businesses. The company last year acquired Bachchan&#8217;s &#8220;Gulabo Sitabo&#8221; movie rights for streaming globally on Prime Video.</p>

<p>Email impacts marketing strategy and enables better overall business success. It’s the lifeblood of an effective multichannel campaign. However, Apple’s Mail Privacy Protection — announced earlier this summer with its iOS 15 update — attempts to eliminate metrics and data associated with email.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://emailclientmarketshare.com/">Litmus Email Client Market Share</a>, in 2020, Apple iPhone, Apple Mail and Apple iPad accounted for nearly half of all email opens. Lacking these insights will create marketing roadblocks for segmented and personalized touch points. Marketers and businesses must prepare by adjusting email strategy and processes before the update occurs.</p>
<p>Companies and consumers have talked about privacy quite a bit lately. Companies fearing breaches, reputation damage and potentially lost revenue want to protect consumer data. Consumer awareness of privacy concerns has grown, too.</p>
<p>In a 2021 survey, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1228234/online-privacy-concerns-us/">over half the respondents</a> expressed more concern about online privacy than in 2020. Consumers expect brands to demonstrate trustworthiness before they willingly share sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>Recognizing an increased desire for better privacy control, Apple revealed new privacy protections in its iOS 15 update, including its Mail Privacy Protection. Apple Mail users may hide their IP addresses, locations and additional data from senders, preventing brands from pulling information like open rates and location. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/">Apple said that</a> “Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user.”</p>
<p>What does this update mean for marketers? The potential disappearance of a critical phase in the marketing mix and multichannel strategy: the post-send and performance pillars of email marketing. No open-rate-specific data &#8212; the brand will appear to have a 100% open rate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is out with a new report collecting the most popular posts on the platform, responding to critics who believe the company is deliberately opaque about its top-performing content.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s new &#8220;<a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report/">widely viewed content reports</a>&#8221; will come out quarterly, reflecting most viewed top News Feed posts in the U.S. every three months — not exactly the kind of real-time data monitoring that might prove useful for observing emerging trends.</p>
<p>With the new data set, Facebook hopes to push back against criticism that its algorithms operate within a black box. But like its often misleading blogged rebuttals and the other sets of cherry-picked data it shares, the company&#8217;s latest gesture at transparency is better than nothing, but not particularly useful.</p>
<p>So what <em>do</em> we learn? According to the new data set, 87% of posts that people viewed in the U.S. during Q2 of this year didn&#8217;t include an outside link. That&#8217;s notable but not very telling since Facebook still has an incredibly massive swath of people sharing and seeing links on a daily basis.</p>
<p>YouTube is predictably the top domain by Facebook&#8217;s chosen metric of &#8220;content viewers,&#8221; which it defines as any account that saw a piece of content on the News Feed, though we don&#8217;t get anything in the way of potentially helpful granular data there. Amazon, Gofundme, TikTok and others also in the top 10, no surprises there either.</p>
<p>Things get weirder when Facebook starts breaking down its most viewed links. The top five links include a website for alumni of the Green Bay Packers football team, a random online CBD marketplace and reppnforchrist.com, an apparently prominent portal for Christianity-themed graphic T-shirts. The subscription <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/technology/epoch-media-right-wing-disinformation.html">page for the Epoch Times</a>, a site well known for spreading pro-Trump conspiracies and other disinformation, comes in at No 10, though it was beaten by a Tumblr link to two cats walking with their tails intertwined.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191434" style="width: 1802px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191434" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191434 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb-top-10.jpeg" alt="" width="1792" height="856" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb-top-10.jpeg 1792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb-top-10.jpeg?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb-top-10.jpeg?resize=300,143 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb-top-10.jpeg?resize=768,367 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb-top-10.jpeg?resize=680,325 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb-top-10.jpeg?resize=1536,734 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/fb-top-10.jpeg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191434" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yahoo and ABC News are the only prominent national media outlets that make the top 20 when the data is sliced and diced in this particular way. Facebook also breaks down which posts the most people viewed during the period with a list of mostly benign if odd memes, including one that reads &#8220;If your VAGINA [cat emoji] or PENIS [eggplant emoji] was named after the last TV show/Move u watched what would it be.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why Facebook chose to collect and present this set of data in this specific way, it&#8217;s because the company is desperately trying to prove a point: That its platform isn&#8217;t overrun by the political conspiracies and controversial right-wing personalities that make headlines.</p>
<p>The dataset is Facebook&#8217;s latest argument in its long feud with New York Times reporter Kevin Roose, who created a Twitter account that surfaces Facebook&#8217;s most engaging posts on a daily basis, as measured through the Facebook-owned social monitoring tool CrowdTangle.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The top-performing link posts by U.S. Facebook pages in the last 24 hours are from:</p>
<p>1. Dan Rather<br />2. Ben Shapiro<br />3. Love Meow<br />4. Ben Shapiro<br />5. Dinesh D&#39;Souza<br />6. Ben Shapiro<br />7. Ben Shapiro<br />8. Sean Hannity<br />9. Fox News<br />10. Steven Crowder</p>
<p>&mdash; Facebook&#39;s Top 10 (@FacebooksTop10) <a href="https://twitter.com/FacebooksTop10/status/1425095560776667136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>By the metric of engagement, Facebook&#8217;s list of top-performing posts in the U.S. are regularly dominated by far-right personalities and sites like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/7/28/22594550/newsmax-ratings-dive-explained">Newsmax</a>, which pushes election conspiracies that Facebook would prefer to distance itself from.</p>
<p>The company argues that Facebook posts with the most interactions don&#8217;t accurately represent the top content on the platform. Facebook insists that reach data, which measures how many people see a given post, is a superior metric, but there&#8217;s no reason that engagement data isn&#8217;t just as relevant if not more so.</p>
<p>&#8220;The content that’s seen by the most people isn’t necessarily the content that also gets the most engagement,&#8221; Facebook wrote, in a dig clearly aimed at Roose.</p>
<p>The platform wants to de-emphasize political content across the board, which isn&#8217;t surprising given its track record of amplifying Russian disinformation, violent far-right militias and the Stop the Steal movement, which culminated in deadly violence at the U.S. Capitol in January.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="M4PYxgd6cD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/facebook-capitol-riot-zuckerberg-sandberg-comments-hearing/">Zuckerberg blames Trump, not Facebook, for the Capitol attack</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zuckerberg blames Trump, not Facebook, for the Capitol attack&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/facebook-capitol-riot-zuckerberg-sandberg-comments-hearing/embed/#?secret=M4PYxgd6cD" data-secret="M4PYxgd6cD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html">The New York Times previously reported</a>, Facebook actually scrapped plans to make its reach data widely available through a public dashboard over fears that even <em>that</em> version of its top-performing posts wouldn&#8217;t reflect well on the company.</p>
<p>Instead, the company opted to offer a taste of that data in a confusingly condensed quarterly report. The result shows plenty of inexplicable junk content (no really, what&#8217;s with the Packers site?), but less in the way of politics. Facebook&#8217;s cursory gesture of transparency notwithstanding, it&#8217;s worth remembering that nothing is stopping the company from letting people see a deeper, broader leaderboard of its most popular content. This isn&#8217;t that.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For our Wednesday show this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> had colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/ulonnaya">Tage Kene-Okafor</a> on the show to chat about the burgeoning African startup scene. Tage has become TechCrunch&#8217;s key correspondent in the area, chronicling the continent&#8217;s expanding venture capital totals, public company performance and startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Given that we&#8217;ve paid attention to just how much money African startups are raising, we wanted to have Tage on to give us a better, deeper understanding of the continent&#8217;s technology activity. Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The power of Y Combinator in Africa:</strong> Is the well-known American accelerator a kingmaker in Africa? Or are we merely seeing more of its activity thanks to our own information biases?</li>
<li><strong>Fintech as core focus:</strong> As in many markets, fintech investment and startup activity stand out in Africa. We wanted to better understand why that&#8217;s the case in Africa, and what startups are building in the realm of financial technology.</li>
<li><strong>African e-commerce:</strong> The continent&#8217;s e-commerce market is perhaps best known through the lens of Jumia, a public tech company that works in the sale of goods online, and their delivery. How quickly is e-commerce growing in Africa, and which startups could be the next breakouts? We asked Tage.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 18, 2021! Good news up top: A big welcome to Kate Park, who recently <a href="https://twitter.com/kateparknews/status/1427767529598976002">joined the TechCrunch family</a>. She’s helping expand our coverage of Asia, with a special eye on South Korea. Make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/kateparknews">follow her on Twitter</a> and say hello.</p>
<p>Now let’s talk Apple and crypto and startups! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple under fire:</strong> Apple’s not having the world’s best day, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apple-walks-back-controversial-safari-changes-with-ios-15-beta-6-update/">retreating on a controversial browser design choice</a> while also coming under fresh criticism for its anti-CSAM system that, it turns out, suffers from hash collisions. Not sure what that means? Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">own Zack Whittaker has you covered</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/crypto-world-shows-signs-of-being-rather-bullish/">Good news from crypto:</a></strong> In the wake of Coinbase’s direct listing, we’ve seen global venture capitalists invest in a number of crypto exchanges. Raising money is never a bad sign for any technology niche. But the good news from cryptoland is more extensive than just venture activity. TechCrunch explores.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/t-mobile-says-at-least-47m-current-and-former-customers-affected-by-data-breach/">T-Mobile hacked:</a></strong> The possible T-Mobile hack that we shared in Daily Crunch recently is real &#8212; and impacts tens of millions of customers. As TechCrunch notes, this is the “fifth time that T-Mobile was hacked in recent years.” Not good.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Our newest TechCruncher has been hard at work, which means we can highlight some of her reporting already. Here’s Park on South Korean secondhand marketplace Danggeun Market and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/south-korean-online-secondhand-marketplace-danggeun-market-raises-162m-at-a-2-7b-valuation/">recent $162 million round that values the company at $2.7 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the funding round rundown, Mayfield investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/what-is-happening-to-risk-taking-in-venture-capital/">Navin Chaddha wants to know what happened</a> to risky venture capital bets. His essay is a response to a particular piece from The Information. We’ve explored the concept before, but Chaddha’s notes are well worth reading.</p>
<p>Now, the rest of today’s key startup news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/api-platform-postman-valued-at-5-6-billion-in-225-million-fundraise/"><strong>APIs are big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>So big in fact, that API-delivered startups aren’t the only companies raising money off the model of building developer-friendly services. Postman just raised $225 million at a $5.6 billion valuation to help other developers build APIs. So that <em>other</em> developers can more easily plug into technology products. Postman competes with Stoplight and Kong, among others.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/mealworm-farming-company-beta-hatch-raises-10m/"><strong>Worm protein cometh:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Food tech is neat. Who doesn’t like that startups are working on all sorts of alternative proteins, right? Raising cows is trash for the environment, and we all know it. But what about insects? Beta Hatch just raised $10 million for its insect-focused protein work. Perhaps the future is crunchy.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/kaipod-learning-thinks-learning-pods-are-here-to-stay/"><strong>KaiPod bets on tiny schools:</strong></a><strong> </strong>One piece of the 2020 and 2021 boom in edtech startup activity involves pods, or “micro-schools.” Per our own Natasha Mascarenhas, Boston-based KaiPod is betting that the model is here to stay and is focusing on the homeschool market to start.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/one-banks-40m-to-offer-all-in-one-financial-services-to-the-middle-class/"><strong>Middle-income fintech?</strong></a><strong> </strong>One neat element of the world of fintech has been the use of financial technology to reduce the cost of financial services and bring more money-management tooling to underserved communities. One is not doing that. Instead, the company is building fintech for the middle class. The startup wants to build an “all-in-one” solution, Mary Ann Azevedo reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/floodmapp-climate-change-flooding/"><strong>Planning for a wet future:</strong></a> That’s what FloodMapp is doing, per Danny Crichton. The startup, based in Australia, “is aiming to wash out the old approaches to hydrology and predictive analytics and put in place a much more modern approach to help emergency managers and citizens know when the floods are coming.” Once you know what is coming, you can prepare, goes the idea.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/stacker-raises-20m-series-a-for-no-code-software-tool-for-business-units/"><strong>More venture wagers on no-code:</strong></a> The latest service hoping to take no-code app development mainstream is Stacker. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/stacker-raises-1-7m-to-help-nocoders-build-apps-from-spreadsheets/">You may have heard of them</a>. Ron Miller reports that the company just landed $20 million from a16z in its Series A round. As with some other services, Stacker lets users turn spreadsheets into apps. (Some startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/spreadsheet-com-wants-to-put-apps-in-your-spreadsheet/">taking the opposite approach</a>, notably.)</li>
<li>Today in great startup names, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/rara-delivery-gets-3-25m-for-its-ambitious-on-demand-delivery-plans-in-indonesia/"><strong>RaRa Delivery just raised $3.25 million</strong></a>. The Indonesian startup wants to bring same-day delivery to its home market. Sequoia Capital India’s Surge program and East Ventures led the round.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to establish a health tech startup advisory board</h2>
<p>Most startups could use an advisory board, but in health tech, it&#8217;s a core requirement.</p>
<p>Founders seeking to innovate in this area have a unique need for mentors who have experience navigating regulations, raising capital and managing R&amp;D, to name just a few areas.</p>
<p>Based on his own experience, Patrick Frank, co-founder and COO of PatientPartner, shared some very specific ideas about who to recruit, where to find them and how to fit them into your cap table.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to leverage these individuals so you are able to focus on the full view of the company to ensure it is something that both the market and investors want at scale,&#8221; says Frank.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://databricks.com">Databricks</a>, the open-source data lake and data management powerhouse has been on quite a financial run lately. Today <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-18/databricks-funding-will-bring-valuation-to-38-billion?srnd=technology-vp">Bloomberg reported</a> the company could be raising a new round worth at least $1.5 billion at an otherworldly $38 billion valuation. That price tag is up $10 billion from its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">last fundraise in February</a> when it snagged $1 billion at a $28 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Databricks declined to comment on the Bloomberg post and its possible new valuation.</p>
<p>The company has been growing like gangbusters, giving credence to the investor thesis that the more your startup makes, the more it is likely to make. Consider that Databricks closed 2020 with $425 million in annual recurring revenue, which in itself was up 75% from the previous year.</p>
<p>As revenue goes up so does valuation, and Databricks is a great example of that rule in action. In October 2019,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/databricks-announces-400m-round-on-6-2b-valuation-as-analytics-platform-continues-to-grow/"> the company raised $400 million</a> at a seemingly modest $6.2 billion valuation (if a valuation like that can be called modest). By February 2021, that had ballooned to $28 billion, and today it could be up to $38 billion if that rumor turns out to be true.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Databricks raises $1B at $28B valuation as it reaches $425M ARR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/embed/#?secret=H0C0O91lUx" data-secret="H0C0O91lUx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One of the reasons that Databricks is doing so well is it operates on a consumption model. The more data you move through the Databricks product family, the more money it makes, and with data exploding, it&#8217;s doing quite well, thank you very much.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Databricks&#8217;s primary competitor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/snowflakes-ipo-could-value-it-as-high-as-24b-salesforce-and-berkshire-to-invest/">Snowflake went public last year</a> and has a market cap of almost $83 billion. In that context, the new figure doesn&#8217;t feel quite so outrageous, But what does it mean in terms of revenue to warrant a valuation like that. Let&#8217;s find out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Valuation math</h2>
<p>Let’s rewind the clock and observe the company’s recent valuation marks and various revenue results at different points in time:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/databricks-announces-400m-round-on-6-2b-valuation-as-analytics-platform-continues-to-grow/">Q3 2019</a>: $200 million run rate, $6.2 billion valuation.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/">Q3 2020</a>: $350 million run rate, no known valuation change.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">EoY 2020</a>: $425 million run rate, $28 billion valuation (Q1 valuation).</li>
<li>Q3 2021: Unclear run rate, possible $38 billion valuation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The company’s 2019 venture round gave Databricks a 31x run rate multiple. By the first quarter of 2021, that had swelled to a roughly 66x multiple if we compare its final 2020 revenue pace to its then-fresh valuation. Certainly software multiples were higher at the start of 2021 than they were in late 2019, but Databricks’s $28 billion valuation was still more than impressive; investors were betting on the company like it was going to be a key breakout winner, and a technology company that would go public eventually in a big way.</p>
<p>To see the company possibly raise more funds would therefore not be surprising. Presumably the company has had a good few quarters since its last round, given its history of revenue accretion. And there’s only more money available today for growing software companies than before.</p>
<p>But what to make of the $38 billion figure? If Databricks merely held onto its early 2021 run rate multiple, the company would need to have reached a roughly $575 million run rate, give or take. That would work out to around 36% growth in the last two-and-a-bit quarters. That works out to less than $75 million in new run rate per quarter since the end of 2020.</p>
<p>Is that possible? Yeah. The company added $75 million in run rate between Q3 2020 and the end of the year. So you can back-of-the-envelope the company’s growth to make a $38 billion valuation somewhat reasonable at a flat multiple. (There’s some fuzz in all of our numbers, as we are discussing rough timelines from the company; we’ll be able to go back and do more precise math once we get the Databricks S-1 filing in due time.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kxOaFOrQZf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/databricks-co-founder-and-ceo-ali-ghodsi-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas/">Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi is coming to TC Sessions: SaaS</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi is coming to TC Sessions: SaaS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/databricks-co-founder-and-ceo-ali-ghodsi-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas/embed/#?secret=kxOaFOrQZf" data-secret="kxOaFOrQZf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>All this raises the question of whether Databricks should be able to command such a high multiple. There’s some precedent. Recently, public software company <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1428004906133336074">Monday.com has a run rate multiple north of 50x,</a> for example. It earned that mark on the back of a strong first quarter as a public company.</p>
<p>Databricks securing a higher multiple while private is not crazy, though we wonder if the data-focused company is managing a similar growth rate. Monday.com grew 94% on a year-over-year basis in its most recent quarter.</p>
<p>All this is to say that you can make the math shake out for Databricks to raise at a $38 billion valuation, but built into that price is quite a lot of anticipated growth. Top quartile public software companies today trade for around 23x their forward revenues, and around 27x their present-day revenues, <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">per Bessemer</a>. To defend its possible new valuation when public, then, leaves quite a lot of work ahead of Databricks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/databricks-co-founder-and-ceo-ali-ghodsi-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas/">company’s CEO, Ali Ghodsi</a>, will join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/">TC Sessions: SaaS on October 27th</a>, and we should know by then if this rumor is, indeed true. Either way, you can be sure we are going to ask him about it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two Democratic senators have asked the new chair of the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Tesla’s statements about the autonomous capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems. The senators, Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), expressed particular concern over Tesla misleading customers into thinking their vehicles are capable of fully autonomous driving.</p>
<p>“Tesla’s marketing has repeatedly overstated the capabilities of its vehicles, and these statements increasingly pose a threat to motorists and other users of the road,” they said. “Accordingly, we urge you to open an investigation into potentially deceptive and unfair practices in Tesla’s advertising and marketing of its driving automation systems and take appropriate enforcement action to ensure the safety of all drivers on the road.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.08.18%20-%20FTC%20-%20Tesla.pdf">their letter to new FTC Chair Lina Khan</a>, they point to a 2019 YouTube video Tesla posted to its channel, which shows a Tesla driving autonomously. The roughly two-minute video is titled “Full Self-Driving” and has been viewed more than 18 million times.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tlThdr3O5Qo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Their claims put Tesla drivers – and all of the travelling public – at risk of serious injury or death,” the senators wrote.</p>
<p>When it comes to Tesla and formal investigations, when it rains, it pours. The letter was published just two days after the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration said it had opened a preliminary investigation into incidents involving Teslas crashing into parked emergency vehicles.</p>

<p>Lina Khan is the youngest person to ever chair the FTC. She’s widely considered the most progressive appointment in recent history, particularly for her scholarship on antitrust law. But should the FTC choose to investigate Tesla, the case would likely have nothing to do with antitrust law and instead fall under the purview of consumer protection. The FTC has the authority to investigate false or misleading claims from companies regarding their products.</p>
<p>This is not the first time prominent figures have called on the FTC to open an investigation into Tesla’s claims. The Center for Auto Safety and Consumer Watchdog, two special interest groups, also <a href="https://www.autosafety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/CAS-and-CW-Letter-to-FTC-on-Tesla-Deceptive-Advertising.pdf">sent a letter</a> in 2018 to the commission over the marketing of Autopilot features. The following year, the NHTSA urged the FTC to investigate whether claims made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk on the Model 3’s safety “constitute[d] unfair or deceptive acts or practices.”</p>
<p>Tesla charges $10,000 for access to a “Full Self-Driving” option at the point of sale, or as a subscription. The company is currently testing beta version 9 of FSD with a few thousand drivers, but the senators take aim at the beta version, too. “After the [beta 9] update, drivers have posted videos online showing their updated Tesla vehicles making unexpected maneuvers that require human intervention to prevent a crash,” they write. “Mr. Musk’s tepid precautions tucked away on social media are no excuse for misleading drivers and endangering the lives of everyone on the road.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When you enter the health tech industry as a new startup, an advisory board is a crucial foundational step. A board can guide you through industry-specific nuances, help you make important decisions and prove your legitimacy to investors looking for a strong industry background.</p>
<p>An advisory board will be able to give you strategic insights about both your company and the wider healthcare and technology industries.</p>
<p>In my experience of raising capital, the unpredictable financial situation at the beginning of the pandemic meant we nearly lost our $2 million round, but came through with a committed $250,000, which we used to bring in about $500,000 in revenue.</p>
<p>Something that helped this process was building our advisory board and starting small — we didn’t go for all of healthcare but instead focused on two healthcare verticals. This allowed us to prove our concept, build case studies and win contracts with specific teams in our customers&#8217; companies.</p>
<p>It pays off to stay focused and prove your worth so that your advisory board members can champion you in niche markets, with the potential to expand in the future. For this reason, it’s important to identify the main intention behind your board, and exactly who should be on it.</p>
<h2>Who to recruit</h2>
<p>Three to five people is an ideal starting point for an advisory board, depending on the size and stage of your company. In health tech, you need more than just the healthcare perspective — you also need the insight of those who have already grown technology companies, perhaps outside of the industry. Our company’s board is an even split of two healthcare and two technology advisers, and, ideally, you want to find a fifth who is well versed in both industries.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>An M.D., a Ph.D. from a respected institution or a thought leader in your relevant field of healthcare is the most important asset to an advisory board. These are the highly decorated physicians who have strong connections and act as a reference for their peers.</p>
<p>They provide instant credibility for your company, help you get into the minds of both patients and healthcare providers, and can outline how various health systems work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is rolling out changes to its newly rebuilt API that will allow third-party developers to build tools and other solutions specifically for its audio chatroom product, Twitter Spaces. The company today <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2021/shape-the-future-of-twitter-spaces">announced</a> it&#8217;s shipping new <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/introducing-new-spaces-endpoints-on-the-twitter-api-v2/158213">endpoints</a> to support Spaces on the Twitter API v2, with the initial focus on enabling discovery of live or scheduled Spaces. This may later be followed by an API update that will make it possible for developers to build out more tools for Spaces&#8217; hosts.</p>
<p>The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/"> first introduced its fully rebuilt API</a> last year, with the goal of modernizing its developer platform while also making it easier to add support for Twitter&#8217;s newer features at a faster pace. The new support for Twitter Spaces in the API is one example of that plan now being put into action.</p>
<p>With the current API update, Twitter hopes developers will build new products that enable users &#8212; both on and off Twitter &#8212; to find Twitter Spaces more easily, the company says. This could potentially broaden the reach of Spaces and introduce its audio chats to more people, which could give Twitter a leg up in the increasingly competitive landscape for audio-based social networking. Today, Twitter Spaces isn&#8217;t only taking on Clubhouse, but also the audio chat experiences being offered by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1376974352994856961">Discord</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22451481/public-app-trading-stocks-live-audio">Public.com</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify</a> and smaller social apps.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6iIJEdB7qF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify launches its live audio app and Clubhouse rival, Spotify Greenroom</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spotify launches its live audio app and Clubhouse rival, Spotify Greenroom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/embed/#?secret=6iIJEdB7qF" data-secret="6iIJEdB7qF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to Twitter, developers will gain access to two new endpoints, Spaces lookup and Spaces search, which allow them to lookup live and scheduled Spaces using specific criteria &#8212; like the Spaces ID, user ID or keywords. The Spaces lookup endpoint also offers a way to begin to understand the public metadata and metrics associated with a Space, like the participant count, speaker count, host profile information, detected language being used, start time, scheduled start time, creation time, status and whether the Space is ticketed or not, Twitter tells us.</p>
<p>To chose which Spaces functionality to build into its API first, Twitter says it spoke to developers who told the company they wanted functionality that could help people discover Spaces they may find interesting and set reminders for attending. Developers said they also want to build tools that would allow Spaces hosts to better understand how well their audio chats are performing. But most of these options aren&#8217;t yet available with today&#8217;s API update. Twitter only said it&#8217;s &#8220;exploring&#8221; other functionality &#8212; like tools that would allow developers to integrate reminders into their products, as well as those that would be able to surface certain metrics fields available in the API or allow developers to build analytics dashboards.</p>
<p>These ideas for other endpoints haven&#8217;t yet gained a spot on Twitter&#8217;s Developer Platform <a href="https://trello.com/b/myf7rKwV/twitter-developer-platform-roadmap">Roadmap</a>, either.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter also told us it&#8217;s not working on any API endpoints that would allow developers to build standalone client apps for Twitter Spaces, as that&#8217;s not something in which its developer community expressed interest.</p>
<p>Several developers have been participating in a weekly Spaces hosted by Daniele Bernardi from Twitter&#8217;s Spaces team, and were already clued in to coming updates. Developers with access to the v2 API will be able to begin building with the new endpoints starting today, but none have new experiences ready to launch at this time. Twitter notes Bernardi will also host <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1djxXqNqWNNKZ">another Spaces event</a> today at 12 PM PT to talk in more detail about the API update and what&#8217;s still to come.</p>
