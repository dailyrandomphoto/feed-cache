</div><p id="speakable-summary">Approaching institutions to raise capital for your venture capital or private equity fund is relatively transparent, but what if you’re targeting family offices and high-net-worth individuals? I see five innovative new methods for raising capital that emerging managers such as <a href="http://versatilevc.com">Versatile VC</a> are using, which I’ve ranked in roughly descending order of popularity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Join online communities and virtual conferences where investors participate.</li>
<li>Use a platform that helps other investors access your fund.</li>
<li>Generally solicit under the 506(c) designation.</li>
<li>Launch a rolling fund.</li>
<li>Crowdfund from retail investors into your general partnership.</li>
</ol>
<p>Will Stringer, CEO of <a href="https://www.chisos.io/">Chisos</a>, feels most family offices won’t respond to cold outreach. &#8220;You need to build a true relationship with family office investors or other general partners that can make warm intros to family office decision-makers,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Family offices, more than any other allocator, rely on trust. [It&#8217;s] not always the case (and always changing), but today it&#8217;s still the majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When you’re raising capital for a fund, you’re fundamentally selling a luxury good, which is seen as more valuable because it’s scarce. That’s part of the secret of the hedge fund industry’s success in gathering assets.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The obvious solution therefore is to get in touch with your friends who have earlier raised or pitched to the family offices. You may also find professional intermediaries who are willing to make an introduction to family offices.</p>
<p>That said, the five methods I outline below may be faster and more efficient.</p>
<h2>Join online communities and virtual conferences where investors participate</h2>
<p>To meet other VCs (some of which may become LPs), among your options are <a href="http://confluence.vc/">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://genzmafia.com/">Gen Z Mafia</a>, <a href="https://airtable.com/shr1LP3zhjgLY2vZC?utm=website">InnovatorsRoom</a> (European focus) and <a href="https://www.techaviv.com/">TechAviv</a> (Israeli focus). To find others, see: <a href="https://teten.com/blog/2021/02/24/how-to-find-the-right-online-communities/">How to find the right online communities</a>. I maintain a proprietary database of the communities I’ve found most valuable, which I share with other members of the Versatile team.</p>
<p>These venues allow you to efficiently get in front of many pre-qualified investors and follow up with those who seem like a tight fit. Unsurprisingly, the best online communities are limited strictly to LPs. Ideally, you’d partner with an anchor/friendly LP who can pass the word on your fund to other potential investors.</p>
<p>In general, at virtual conferences, I recommend first fill out your online profile with all possible keywords and your photo. Side-channeling is powerful and is the equivalent of going into a corner at a conference and talking privately. Look up the profiles of all the people attending a conference or in an online community and send the relevant folks a customized message introducing yourself.</p>
<p>This is one of the primary advantages of virtual events versus traditional face-to-face conferences, where people do not conveniently wear a hat with their LinkedIn profile visible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tapping the tiny screen of the Apple Watch with precision has certain level of fundamental difficulty, but for some people with disabilities it&#8217;s genuinely impossible. Apple has remedied this with a new mode called &#8220;Assistive Touch&#8221; that detects hand gestures to control a cursor and navigate that way.</p>
<p>The feature was announced as part of <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities/">a collection of accessibility-focused additions across its products</a>, but Assistive Touch seems like the one most likely to make a splash across the company&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>It relies on the built-in gyroscope and accelerometer, as well as data from the heart rate sensor, to deduce the position of the wrist and hand. Don&#8217;t expect it to tell a peace sign from a metal sign just yet, but for now it detects &#8220;pinch&#8221; (touching the index finger to the thumb) and &#8220;clench&#8221; (make a loose fist), which can act as basic &#8220;next&#8221; and &#8220;confirm&#8221; actions. Incoming calls, for instance, can be quickly accepted with a clench.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Designing with accessibility in mind: a conversation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/designing-with-accessibility-in-mind-a-conversation/embed/#?secret=Z5LcT6K64O" data-secret="Z5LcT6K64O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Most impressive, however, is the motion pointer. You can activate it either by selecting it in the Assistive Touch menu, or by shaking your wrist vigorously. It then detects the position of your hand as you move it around, allowing you to &#8220;swipe&#8221; by letting the cursor linger at the edge of the screen, or interact with things using a pinch or clench.</p>
<p>Needless to say this could be extremely helpful for anyone who only has the one hand available for interacting with the watch. And even for those who don&#8217;t strictly need it, the ability to keep one hand on the exercise machine, cane, or whatever else while doing smartwatch things is surely an attractive possibility. (One wonders about the potential of this control method as a cursor for other platforms as well&#8230;)</p>

<p>Assistive Touch is only one of many accessibility updates Apple shared in this news release; other advances for the company&#8217;s platforms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SignTime, an ASL interpreter video call for Apple Store visits and support</li>
<li>Support for new hearing aids</li>
<li>Improved VoiceOver-based exploration of images</li>
<li>A built-in background noise generator (which I fully intend to use)</li>
<li>Replacement of certain buttons with non-verbal mouth noises (for people who have limited speech and mobility)</li>
<li>Memoji customizations for people with oxygen tubes, cochlear implants, and soft helmets</li>
<li>Featured media in the App Store, Apple TV, Books, and Maps apps from or geared towards people with disabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s all clustered around Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is tomorrow, May 20th.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You may not be familiar with the term &#8220;dark patterns&#8221; but the manipulative design phenomenon is ubiquitous in the apps and services we use every day.</p>
<p>Dark patterns nudge consumers to make choices that enrich companies, usually at their own expense. That can look like misleading wording that leads someone to sign their personal data away or a hidden button that results in a renewed subscription they&#8217;d probably rather cancel.</p>
<p>If you run across a sketchy dark pattern design, you can now report it on <a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org/">Darkpatternstipline.org</a>, a dedicated site hosted by Consumer Reports. The new tip line is a joint project from the EFF, PEN America, Consumer Reports and Access Now, among other digital rights advocates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Collecting dark pattern reports is an effort that could actually have teeth now, thanks to new laws taking aim at the manipulative design practice.</p>
<p>In March, California modified its landmark privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-announces-approval-additional-regulations-empower-data">ban dark patterns in tech&#8217;s own backyard</a>. &#8220;These protections ensure that consumers will not be confused or misled when seeking to exercise their data privacy rights,&#8221; California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said of the new regulations.</p>
<p>Even Congress is worried about dark patterns. In 2019, a bipartisan bill <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1084/all-info">called the DETOUR Act</a> sought to outlaw user interfaces &#8220;obscuring, subverting, or impairing user autonomy&#8221; for large companies with more than 100 million users. While that legislation didn&#8217;t go anywhere, coercive design choices are one of the many concerns that lawmakers have on their radar as they seek to implement new federal regulations for big tech companies.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever run into a bunch of contradictory checkboxes that try to trick you into signing up for someone’s email list? That’s a dark pattern. <a href="https://t.co/7UoR2h0xKc">pic.twitter.com/7UoR2h0xKc</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1115660835328856064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 9, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>For the tip line&#8217;s creators, flagging concerns for the regulators shaping tech policy is a priority. &#8220;If we want to stop dark patterns on the internet and beyond, we first have to assess what’s out there, and then use these examples to influence policymakers and lawmakers,&#8221; EFF Designer Shirin Mori said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope the Dark Patterns Tip Line will help us move towards more fair, equitable, and accessible technology products and services for everyone.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Part of learning to be an engineer is understanding the tools you&#8217;ll have to work with — voltmeters, spectrum analyzers, things like that. But why use two, or eight for that matter, where one will do? The Moku:Go combines several commonly used tools into one compact package, saving room on your workbench or classroom while also providing a modern, software-configurable interface. Creator Liquid Instruments has just raised $13.7 million to bring this gadget to students and engineers everywhere.</p>

<p>The idea behind <a href="https://www.liquidinstruments.com/products/hardware-platforms/mokugo/">Moku:Go</a> is largely the same as the company&#8217;s previous product, the <a href="https://www.liquidinstruments.com/products/hardware-platforms/mokulab/">Moku:Lab</a>. Using a standard input port, a set of FPGA-based tools perform the same kind of breakdowns and analyses of electrical signals as you would get in a larger or analog device. But being digital saves a lot of space that would normally go towards bulky analog components.</p>
<p>The Go takes this miniaturization further than the Lab, doing many of the same tasks at half the weight and with a few useful extra features. It&#8217;s intended for use in education or smaller engineering shops where space is at a premium. Combining eight tools into one is a major coup when your bench is also your desk and your file cabinet.</p>
<p>Those eight tools, by the way, are: waveform generator, <em>arbitrary</em> waveform generator, frequency response analyzer, logic analyzer/pattern generator, oscilloscope/voltmeter, PID controller, spectrum analyzer, and data logger. It&#8217;s hard to say whether that really adds up to more or less than eight, but it&#8217;s definitely a lot to have in a package the size of a hardback book.</p>
<p>You access and configure them using a software interface rather than a bunch of knobs and dials — though let&#8217;s be clear, there are good arguments for both. When you&#8217;re teaching a bunch of young digital natives, however, a clean point-and-click interface is probably a plus. The UI is actually very attractive; you can see several examples by <a href="https://www.liquidinstruments.com/products/hardware-platforms/mokugo/">clicking the instruments on this page</a>, but here&#8217;s an example of the waveform generator:</p>

<p>Love those pastels.</p>
<p>The Moku:Go currently works with Macs and Windows but doesn&#8217;t have a mobile app yet. It integrates with Python, MATLAB, and LabVIEW. Data goes over Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Compared with the Moku:Lab, it has a few perks. A USB-C port instead of a mini, a magnetic power port, a 16-channel digital I/O, optional power supply of up to four channels, and of course it&#8217;s half the size and weight. It compromises on a few things — no SD card slot and less bandwidth for its outputs, but if you need the range and precision of the more expensive tool, you probably need a lot of other stuff too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154979" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154979" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2154979" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg" alt="A person uses a Moku Go device at a desk." width="450" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg 1410w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mokugo-screen.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154979" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Liquid Instruments</p></div></p>
<p>Since the smaller option also costs $500 to start (&#8220;a price comparable to a textbook&#8221;&#8230; yikes) compared with the big one&#8217;s $3,500, there&#8217;s major savings involved. And it&#8217;s definitely cheaper than buying all those instruments individually.</p>
<p>The Moku:Go is &#8220;targeted squarely at university education,&#8221; said Liquid Instruments VP of marketing Doug Phillips. &#8220;Professors are able to employ the device in the classroom and individuals, such as students and electronic engineering hobbyists, can experiment with it on their own time. Since its launch in March, the most common customer profile has been students purchasing the device at the direction of their university.&#8221;</p>
<p>About a hundred professors have signed on to use the device as part of their Fall classes, and the company is working with other partners in universities around the world. &#8220;<span id="m_-2565074456567346020gmail-docs-internal-guid-6d2963ea-7fff-6a4b-4358-beccb3ace6a1">There is a real demand for portable, flexible systems that can handle the breadth of four years of curriculum,&#8221; Phillips said.</span></p>
<p>Production starts in June (samples are out to testers), the rigors and costs of which likely prompted the recent round of funding. The $13.7M comes from existing investors <span id="m_-1917794109127701751gmail-docs-internal-guid-233761ac-7fff-d305-b540-d9cc63aed5e0">Anzu Partners and ANU Connect Ventures, and new investors F1 Solutions and Moelis Australia’s Growth Capital Fund. It&#8217;s a convertible note &#8220;in advance of an anticipated Series B round in 2022,&#8221; Phillips said. It&#8217;s a larger amount than they intended to raise at first, and the note nature of the round is also not standard, but given the difficulties faced by hardware companies over the last year, some irregularities are probably to be expected.<br />
</span></p>
<p>No doubt the expected B round will depend considerably on the success of the Moku:Go&#8217;s launch and adoption. But this promising product looks as if it might be a commonplace item in thousands of classrooms a couple years from now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/maps/five-maps-updates-io-2021">announced</a> a series of updates soon coming to Google Maps, as part of the company&#8217;s larger goal of delivering over 100 A.I.-powered improvements to the platform by year-end. Among the new improvements, detailed during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-i-o-2021">Google I/O&#8217;s developer conference</a> this week, are new routing updates, Live View enhancements, an expansion of detailed street maps, a new &#8220;area busyness&#8221; feature, and a more personalized Maps experience.</p>
<p>The new routing updates will involve the use of machine learning and navigation information to help reduce &#8220;hard-braking moments&#8221; &#8212; meaning, those times when traffic suddenly slows, and you have to slam on your brakes.</p>
<p>Today, when you get your directions in Maps, Google calculates multiple route options based on a variety of factors, like how many lanes a road has or how direct the route is. With the update, it will add one more: which routes are least likely to cause a &#8220;hard-braking moment.&#8221; Google will recommend the route that has the least likelihood of those sorts of moments, if the ETA is the same or the difference is minimal between another route. The company says it expects this change could potentially eliminate 100 million hard-breaking events in routes driven with Google Maps every year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Live View, Google Maps&#8217; augmented reality feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/08/google-launches-live-view-ar-walking-directions-for-google-maps/">launched in 2019</a>, will soon become available directly from the map interface so you can instantly explore the neighborhood and view details about nearby shops and restaurants, including how busy they are, recent reviews and photos. It will also be updated to include street signs for complex intersections, and will tell you where you are in relation to places like your hotel, so you can make your way back more easily, when in unfamiliar territory.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154940" style="width: 492px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154940" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2154940" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?w=482" alt="" width="482" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg 860w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?resize=106,150 106w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?resize=213,300 213w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?resize=768,1084 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?resize=482,680 482w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-12.58.40-PM.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154940" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google will also expand the more detailed maps it first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/google-maps-adds-street-level-details-in-select-cities-more-colorful-imagery-worldwide/">rolled out to</a> last year to New York, San Francisco, and London. These maps offer more granularity, including both natural features and street info like the location of sidewalks, crosswalks and pedestrian islands, for example. The information can be particularly useful for those who navigate a city by foot, scooter, bike, or in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>By the end of 2021, these detailed maps will be available in 50 more cities, including  Berlin, São Paulo, Seattle, and Singapore.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154946" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154946" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2154946" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.33-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="396" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.33-PM.jpg 1932w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.33-PM.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.33-PM.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.33-PM.jpg?resize=768,448 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.33-PM.jpg?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.33-PM.jpg?resize=1536,895 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.33-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154946" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Another new feature expands on the &#8220;busyness&#8221; information Google already provided for businesses, based on anonymized location data collected by Maps users. During the pandemic, that feature became a useful way to avoid crowds at local stores and other businesses, for health and safety. Now, Google Maps will display &#8220;busyness&#8221; info for parts of town or neighborhoods, to help you either avoid (or perhaps locate) crowded areas &#8212; like a street festival, farmers&#8217; market, or nightlife spot, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154945" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154945" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2154945" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg 1874w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=1536,911 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.01.45-PM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154945" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, Google Maps will begin customizing its interface to the individual in new ways.</p>
<p>For starters, it may show relevant information based on the time of day where you are.</p>
<p>For instance, when you open the map at 8 AM on a weekday, you may see coffee shops more prominently highlighted, but at night, you may see dinner spots. If you&#8217;ve traveled out of town, Google Maps may instead show you landmarks and tourists attractions. And if you want to see more of the same, you can tap on any place to see similar places nearby.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154944" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154944" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2154944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.02.08-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="371" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.02.08-PM.jpg 2084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.02.08-PM.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.02.08-PM.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.02.08-PM.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.02.08-PM.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.02.08-PM.jpg?resize=1536,839 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.02.08-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1118 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-1.02.08-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154944" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google says these features will roll out globally across iOS and Android in the coming months, but did not provide an exact timeframe for each specific feature. The more detailed maps will arrive by year-end, however.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Emeritus plans to acquire iD Tech, a STEM education service for children, which brings a whole different set of customers to its umbrella.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mumbai-based<a href="https://emeritus.org/"> Emeritus</a>, an edtech company that works with universities to create online upskilling courses for employed folks, just spent a big chunk of cash to break into K-12.</p>
<p>Emeritus, which is part of the Eruditus group, announced today that it plans to acquire <a href="https://www.idtech.com/">iD Tech</a>, a STEM education service for children. The acquisition, which has not yet closed, is estimated to be around $200 million and leaves iD Tech operating as an independent brand for now.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			In order to execute on lifelong learning, a company needs to be able to seamlessly transition its audiences &#8212; from high school to college to post-employment &#8212; between products.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>In August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-backs-indian-education-startup-eruditus-in-113-million-fundraise/">Eruditus raised a $113 million Series D</a> from investors including Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sequoia India and Leeds Illuminate. Today, the startup has more than 200 programs, from bootcamps to online degree programs, that are offered to career folks in partnership with more than 50 of the world’s top universities, including MIT, Harvard and Columbia. ID Tech brings a whole different set of customers to its umbrella: The startup offers courses for elementary through high-school students across the globe taught by college students in the U.S.</p>
<p>The acquisition will allow Emeritus, which has been on a hiring and fundraising tear as of late, to grow beyond adult learning and well into the world of lifelong learning. It’s a trend we spotted back in a January edtech investor survey: Investors then mentioned how remote education needs to extend beyond school hours as learners become more multilayered. Edtech companies would soon have to find ways to create value for students throughout their educational experience, starting from early childhood into post-employment.</p>
<p>Breaking into lifelong learning sounds great, but it’s a complex goal, given that a freshman in high school learns differently than a full-time employed professional with six years of experience. Emeritus CEO and co-founder Ashwin Damera spoke to TechCrunch to explain why it makes sense from a product and revenue perspective.</p>
<p>“Last year we started seeing a lot of K-12 teaching moving online,” Damera said. “Then we opened our eyes and said, we used to think that this audience is not ready to learn online, but maybe we should relook at that assumption.”</p>
<h2>The universe of universities</h2>
<p>In order to execute on lifelong learning, a company needs to be able to seamlessly transition its audiences &#8212; from high school to college to post-employment &#8212; between products. In Emeritus’ case, Damera explained how the two companies already overlap in the middle of that chain: higher ed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt 2021</a> super early bird deal took our best deal in its beak and flew the coop. But you can still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy a Startup Alley Pass</a> and exhibit in our virtual expo area at a great price. Take advantage of our early bird deal, cross an item off your to-do list and keep $50 in your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The early bird deadline is <strong>August 6 at 11:59 pm (PT),</strong> and if that feels like a long way off, don’t be fooled. It’ll be here before you know it, and Startup Alley Passes are selling faster than ever<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">. Get yours for just $249</a> while you can.</p>
<p>In addition to your virtual exhibit space and the abundance of networking that goes on in the Alley, we have additional opportunities for exhibitors. For starters, each exhibiting startup gets to participate in a breakout pitch feedback session.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You’ll have two minutes to pitch live to TechCrunch staff and thousands of Disrupt attendees around the world. And you’ll receive plenty of great feedback to improve your pitch deck.</p>
<p>“I walked away with a bunch of notes to reorganize my pitch deck. It&#8217;s a lot of work, but it’s very rewarding because now I have a clear path. Disrupt was like an authoritative instruction manual for how to finish my pitch deck.” — Michael McCarthy, CEO, Repositax.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: TechCrunch Editorial team will choose two outstanding exhibiting startups to be Startup Battlefield Wild Cards. Those founders will get to compete for the $100,000 (equity-free) cash and massive exposure in the Startup Battlefield. It. Could. Be. You.</p>
<p>Team TechCrunch will also host a series of Startup Alley Crawls — one hour for each business category. Editors will go live on the Disrupt stage and interview various founders exhibiting in Startup Alley. It’s great global exposure.</p>
<p>Here’s another big reason to get your exhibitor pass sooner rather than later. It’s a new opportunity called Startup Alley+ and you must purchase a Startup Alley Pass <strong>before Friday, June 4 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong> to be eligible for this VIP Disrupt experience. TechCrunch will choose up to 50 startups to participate. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/heres-all-the-biz-dev-support-startup-alley-founders-get-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">Read about all the perks and benefits here</a>. Get your pass before the deadline, because the Startup Alley+ experience kicks off in July at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">Early Stage 2021 — Marketing and Fundraising</a>.</p>
<p>So many great reasons to exhibit in Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">TC Disrupt 2021</a>, but the clock is ticking on early bird savings. Take one simple task off your overloaded to-do list, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy your Startup Alley Pass now</a> — while it’s on your mind — and save yourself $50 bucks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is resuming work on reducing the granularity of information presented in user-agent strings on its Chrome browser, it <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/05/update-on-user-agent-string-reduction.html">said today</a> &#8212; picking up an effort it put on pause last year, during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when it said it wanted to avoid piling extra migration burden on the web ecosystem in the middle of a public health emergency.</p>
<p>The resumption of the move has implications for web developers as the changes to user-agent strings could break some existing infrastructure without updates to code. Although Google has laid out a pretty generous-looking timeline of origin tests &#8212; and its blog post emphasizes that &#8220;<i>no User-Agent string changes will be coming to the stable channel of Chrome in 2021</i>&#8220;. So the changes certainly won&#8217;t ship before 2022.</p>
<p>The move, via development of its Chromium engine, to pare back user-agent strings to reduce their ability to be used to track users is related to Google&#8217;s overarching Privacy Sandbox plan &#8212; aka the stack of proposals it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">announced in 2019 </a>&#8212; when it said it wanted to evolve web architecture by developing a set of open standards to &#8220;fundamentally enhance&#8221; web privacy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of this move toward a more private default for Chromium is depreciating support for third party tracking cookies. Another part is Google&#8217;s proposed technological alternative for on-device ad-targeting of cohorts of users (aka FLoCs).</p>
<p>Cleaning up exploitable surface areas like fingerprintable user-agent strings is another component &#8212; and should be understood as part of the wider &#8216;hygiene&#8217; drive required to deliver on the goals of Privacy Sandbox.</p>
<p>The latter remains a massive, tanker-turning effort, though.</p>
<p>And while there has been some suggestions Google could be ready to ship Privacy Sandbox in early 2022, given the timelines it&#8217;s allowing for origin tests of the changes to user-agent strings &#8212; a seven phase rollout, with two origin trials lasting at least six months apiece &#8212; that looks unlikely. (At least not for all the constituent parts of the Sandbox to ship.)</p>
<p>Indeed, back in 2019 Google was upfront that the changes it had in mind would not come overnight, saying then: &#8220;It’s going to be a multi-year journey&#8221;. Albeit in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">January 2020</a> it seemed to dial up at least part of the timeline, saying it wanted to phase out support for third party cookies within two years.</p>
<p>Still, Google can&#8217;t realistically depreciate tracking cookies without also shipping changes in browser standards that are needed to provide publishers and advertisers with alternative means to do ad targeting, measurement and fraud prevention. So any delay to elements of the Privacy Sandbox could have a knock-on impact on its &#8216;two-year&#8217; timeline to end support for third party cookies. (And 2022 may well be the very earliest the shift could happen.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/embed/#?secret=O7lUDo6o6i" data-secret="O7lUDo6o6i" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There&#8217;s push and pull going on here, as Google&#8217;s effort to retool web infrastructure &#8212; and, more specifically, to change how web users and activity can and can&#8217;t be tracked &#8212; has massive implications for many other web users; most notably the adtech players and publishers whose businesses are deeply embedded in this tracking web.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it has faced a lot of pushback from those sectors.</p>
<p>Its plan to end support for third party tracking cookies is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">under regulatory scrutiny in Europe</a> &#8212; where advertisers complained it&#8217;s an anti-competitive power move to block third parties&#8217; access to user data while continuing to help itself to masses of first party user data (given its dominance of key Internet services). So depending on how regulators respond to ecosystem concerns Google may not be able to keep full control of the timeline, either.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, from a privacy perspective, Chrome paring back user-agent strings is a welcome &#8212; if overdue &#8212; move.</p>
<p>Indeed Google&#8217;s blog post notes that it&#8217;s the laggard vs similar efforts already undertaken by the web engines underlying Apple&#8217;s Safari browser and Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox.</p>
<p>&#8220;As noted in the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/ua-client-hints#explainer-reducing-user-agent-granularity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Agent Client Hints explainer</a>, the User Agent string presents challenges for two reasons. Firstly, it <a href="https://w3c.github.io/fingerprinting-guidance/#passive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passively exposes</a> quite a lot of information about the browser for every HTTP request that <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/#unsanctioned-tracking-tracking-without-user-control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be used for fingerprinting</a>,&#8221; Google writes, fleshing out its rational for the change. &#8220;Secondly, it has grown in length and complexity over the years and encourages error-prone string parsing. We believe the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Agent Client Hints API</a> solves both of these problems in a more developer- and user-friendly manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the development, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Dr Lukasz Olejnik</a>, an independent consultant and security and privacy researcher who has advised the W3C on technical architecture and standards, describes the incoming change as &#8220;a great privacy improvement&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The user-agent change will reduce entropy and so reduce identifiability,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;I view it as a great privacy improvement because considering IP address and the UA string at the same time is highly identifying. UAs are not exactly simplified in Firefox/Safari in the way Chrome suggests doing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s blog post notes that its UA plan was &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">designed with backwards compatibility in mind&#8221;, and seeks to reassure developers &#8212; adding that: &#8220;While any changes to the User Agent string need to be managed carefully, we expect minimal friction for developers as we roll this out (i.e., existing parsers should continue to operate as expected).</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If your site, service, library or application relies on certain bits of information being present in the User Agent string such as <b>Chrome minor version</b>, <b>OS version number</b>, or <b>Android device model</b>, you will need to begin the migration to use the <a href="https://web.dev/user-agent-client-hints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Agent Client Hints API</a> instead,&#8221; it goes on. &#8220;If you don’t require any of these, then no changes are required and things should continue to operate as they have to date.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite Google&#8217;s reassurances, Olejnik suggested some web developers could still be caught on the hop &#8212; if they fail to take note of the development and don&#8217;t made necessary updates to their code in time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Web developers may be concerned as certain libraries or backend systems depend on the strict UA string existing as today,&#8221; he noted, adding: &#8220;Things may stop working as intended. This might be a sudden and surprising breakage. But the actual impact at a scale is unpredictable.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Bipartisanship has long been out of fashion, but one common pursuit among Democrats and Republicans in Washington has been placing Big Tech companies under a microscope.</p>
<p>Congressional committees have held scores of hearings, lawsuits have been filed and legislation has been introduced to regulate privacy and data collection. The knock-on effect of these reforms for young companies and their venture investors is unclear. But one aspect of increased antitrust scrutiny — restrictions on acquisitions — would have a significant negative effect on our entrepreneurial ecosystem, and policymakers should approach these changes with caution.</p>
<h2>Acquisitions are an important element of the startup ecosystem</h2>
<p>For VC-backed companies, there are effectively three outcomes: standalone company (often via an IPO), merger or acquisition, or bankruptcy. Despite best efforts, company failure is the most common outcome &#8212; more than <a href="https://innovationfootprints.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/startup-genome-report-extra-on-premature-scaling.pdf">90%</a> of startups fail. Fortunately, the success stories are often companies with a big impact, like Moderna and Zoom, which helped the world in the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Acquisitions contribute to the health of the startup ecosystem, as entrepreneurs who realize liquidity through the sale of their company regularly go on to found innovative new companies and often invest in other startups as angel investors or venture capitalists.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are optimists by nature, and so when the company journey begins, there is great hope of one day creating a standalone public company. However, in most cases, an IPO is not possible. The reality is that entrepreneurship is incredibly hard, and the journey from infancy to public company is one that relatively few companies achieve.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank’s <a href="https://www.svb.com/globalassets/library/uploadedfiles/content/trends_and_insights/reports/startup_outlook_report/suo_global_report_2020-final.pdf">2020 Global Startup Outlook</a> puts it this way: “[T]he fact is most entrepreneurs never expect to reach a public market exit.” Accordingly, 58% of startups expect to be acquired<strong>.</strong> NVCA-Pitchbook <a href="https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NVCA-2021-Yearbook.pdf">data</a> on acquisitions and IPOs back up the sentiment of founders when it comes to likely exit opportunities. In 2020, there was an approximately 10:1 ratio of acquisitions of VC-backed companies to IPOs, with 1,042 venture-backed companies acquired and 103 entering the public markets.</p>
<p>Some might argue that acquisitions are more dominant today because of the anti-competitive motivations of current tech incumbents. But as Patricia Nakache of Trinity Ventures said in <a href="https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Testimony-of-Patricia-Nakache-SJC-as-submitted-9-23-19.pdf">testimony</a> before the Senate Judiciary Committee: “[Acquisitions have] been commonplace in the U.S. since before the dawn of the modern venture capital industry.” In fact, today we are witnessing <em>fewer </em>acquisitions relative to IPOs than in years past, as the average acquisition-to-IPO ratio since 2004 is approximately 15:1. This is happening against a backdrop of challenges in taking small-cap companies public that has reduced the number of companies in the public markets today.</p>
<p>Acquisitions contribute to the health of the startup ecosystem, as entrepreneurs who realize liquidity through the sale of their company regularly go on to found innovative new companies and often invest in other startups as angel investors or venture capitalists.</p>
<p>Furthermore, acquisitions help power the returns of VC funds, thereby allowing VCs to raise new funds and invest in the next generation of entrepreneurs. This “recycling effect” is one of the key drivers of dynamism in our economy and should not be slowed down.</p>
<h2>Acquisition changes could impact entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>Despite the importance of acquisitions, antitrust reform has included significant changes to how acquisitions are assessed by the federal government. The two most prominent examples in this space are Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/senator-klobuchar-introduces-sweeping-bill-to-promote-competition-and-improve-antitrust-enforcement">Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act</a> (CALERA) and Sen. Josh Hawley’s <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-introduces-trust-busting-twenty-first-century-act-plan-bust-anti-competitive-big#:~:text=The%20Trust%2DBusting%20for%20the%20Twenty%2DFirst%20Century%20Act%20will%3A&amp;text=Replace%20the%20outdated%20numerically%2Dfocused,of%20competition%20in%20the%20U.S.">Trust-Busting for the Twenty-First Century Act</a>.</p>
<p>These bills are likely a reaction to <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf?utm_campaign=4493-519">findings</a> that incumbents have acted like Pac-Man, gobbling up would-be competitors before they become a competitive problem. But both proposals would ultimately harm startup activity and competition rather than propel it.</p>
<p>A common thread between these proposals is to restrict acquisitions by companies valued at more than $100 billion. Hawley’s bill would impose an outright ban on acquisitions by companies of that market cap that “lessen competition in any way.”</p>
<p>Klobuchar’s bill would shift the burden of proof to parties to an acquisition, a major change because the U.S. government bears the burden currently. This means if the government challenges an acquisition in federal court, the parties to the acquisition must demonstrate it does not “create an appreciable risk of materially lessening competition.” If that standard is not met, the acquisition could be blocked.</p>
<p>Both proposals have negative ramifications for venture-backed companies.</p>
<p>First, consider the scope of the proposals: A $100 billion company is indeed a large one, but setting the threshold there captures <em>far</em> more than the large tech companies that have been hauled before Congress for antitrust hearings. Globally, about 150 companies are valued at $100 billion or more, and the U.S. is home to more than 80 of those companies. That exposes acquirers as wide-ranging as Estee Lauder, John Deere, Starbucks and Thermo Fisher Scientific. If you are struggling to recall those companies being under the antitrust spotlight, then you are not alone.</p>
<p>Second, the legal standards imposed by these new bills are daunting. Klobuchar’s proposal leaves startups scratching their heads on where the line is on which acquisitions are tolerated, while Hawley’s bill throws up a misguided red light for vast amounts of acquisitions. These two standards are particularly vexing since acquirers are generally looking for acquirees that complement their existing business. In addition, many of the most acquisitive companies are multifaceted ones that presumably compete with an array of other companies in some way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the bills from Klobuchar and Hawley would disrupt an important part of our nation’s startup ecosystem. Acquisitions act like grease to help keep the wheels moving by injecting liquidity into the system so participants can move on to create new and hopefully better companies for our country. Those wheels should not be slowed down when the country needs all the entrepreneurship it can muster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bitcoin, Ethereum and a host of Altcoins suffered massive drops Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, erasing months of gains and hundreds of billions in market cap. The overall crypto market shrunk more than 20% over the past 24 hours according to crypto tracker <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s behind the drop? Well, some may say the market was flying too close to the sun as investors piled into speculative and technically unremarkable projects like Dogecoin. Others may pin the blame on Elon Musk, who announced that Tesla would no longer be accepting bitcoin for Tesla purchases, which investors feared could trigger a broader backlash among corporate adopters who they hoped would be encouraged to put bitcoin on their balance sheets.</p>
<p>Not all cryptocurrencies are seeing the same fortune, while Bitcoin dropped to nearly $31k, more than half its all-time-high, Ethereum fell to prices it first reached last month. Some of the steepest losses were seen by Dfinity&#8217;s Internet Computer token which has shed nearly 60% of its value in the past week. Meanwhile, multi-chain development platform Polygon has surged throughout the broader crash, up 88% this week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Public market investors got a taste for the crypto market&#8217;s volatility as Coinbase stock fell 5% Wednesday morning, down more than 47% from its briefly achieved all-time-high and 10% lower than its direct listing target price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chrome, at least in its experimental Canary version on Android (and only for users in the U.S.), is getting an <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/05/an-experiment-in-helping-users-and-web.html">interesting update</a> in the coming weeks that brings back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS#:~:text=RSS%20(RDF%20Site%20Summary%20or,in%20a%20single%20news%20aggregator.">RSS</a>, the once-popular format for getting updates from all the sites you love in Google Reader and similar services.</p>
<p>In Chrome, users will soon see a &#8216;Follow&#8217; feature for sites that support RSS and the browser&#8217;s New Tab page will get what is essentially a (very) basic RSS reader &#8212; I guess you could almost call it a &#8220;Google Reader.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re not talking about a full-blown RSS reader here. The New Tab page will show you updates from the sites you follow in chronological order, but it doesn&#8217;t look like you can easily switch between feeds, for example. It&#8217;s a start, though.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2154833" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WC-Chrome-blogpost-final-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154833" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2154833" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WC-Chrome-blogpost-final-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="556" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WC-Chrome-blogpost-final-2.png 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WC-Chrome-blogpost-final-2.png?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WC-Chrome-blogpost-final-2.png?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WC-Chrome-blogpost-final-2.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154833" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Today, people have many ways to keep up with their favorite websites, including subscribing to mailing lists, notifications and RSS. It’s a lot for any one person to manage, so we’re exploring how to simplify the experience of getting the latest and greatest from your favorite sites directly in Chrome, building on the open RSS web standard,&#8221; Janice Wong, Product Manager, Google Chrome, writes in today&#8217;s update. &#8220;Our vision is to help people build a direct connection with their favorite publishers and creators on the web.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson told me that the way the company has implemented this is to have Google crawl RSS feeds &#8220;more frequently to ensure Chrome will be able to deliver the latest and greatest content to users in the Following section on the New Tab page.&#8221;</p>
<p>RSS was one of the fundamental technologies of <a href="http://jeffnolan.com/wp/2010/09/11/consumer-rss-1999-2010/">the Web 2.0 era</a>. Even today, it&#8217;s still the easiest way to get timely updates from your favorite sites (though some may not offer feeds anymore) without any recommendation algorithms getting in your way. Yet while RSS was always extremely useful, the user experience wasn&#8217;t always ideal, though services like Google Reader (RIP) and <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> did a lot to make it simple enough to subscribe to feeds and get updates. But when Google offered Google Reader at the altar of Google+ back in 2013, that era came to an end, even as diehard news junkies kept holding on to their Feedly accounts and old copies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a>.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people will be glad to see that Google is bringing it back as a core feature of its browser. If you prefer an open web, RSS, for all its occasional clumsiness, is the way to go.</p>
<p>For now, though, this is only an experiment. Google says it wants to gather feedback from &#8221; publishers, bloggers, creators, and citizens of the open web&#8221; as it aims to build &#8220;deeper engagement between users and web publishers in Chrome.&#8221; Hopefully, it won&#8217;t stay this way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://netlify.com">Netlify</a>, the startup that&#8217;s bringing a micro services approach to building websites, announced today that it has acquired YC alum <a href="http://FeaturePeek.com">FeaturePeek</a>. The two companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>With FeaturePeek, the company gets a major upgrade in its design review capability. While Netlify has had a previewing capability called Deploy Previews in the platform since 2016, it lacked a good way for reviewers to discuss and comment on the design. The preview alone was useful as far as it goes, but having the ability to collaborate on the design remained a missing piece until today.</p>
<p>With FeaturePeek, the company can expand on Deploy Previews to not only preview the design, but also enable all the stakeholders in the design process to add their opinions, edits and changes as the design moves through the creation process instead of having to wait until the end or gather the comments in a separate document or communications channel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As FeaturePeek co-founder Eric Silverman told me at the time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/featurepeek-moves-beyond-y-combinator-with-1-8m-seed/">of their seed funding last year</a>, his product removed a lot of frustration when the web coders would get all their review comments at the last minute:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Right now, there’s no dedicated place to give feedback on that new work until it hits their staging environment, and so we’ll spin up ad hoc deployment previews, either on commit or on pull requests and those fully running environments can be shared with the team. On top of that, we have our overlay where you can file bugs, you can annotate screenshots, record video or leave comments.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt Biilmann, CEO and co-founder, Netlify says that when his company created Deploy Previews, it was in reaction to customers who were kloodging together their own solutions to the issue. They learned that even with their own preview feature, customers craved a communications capability.</p>

<p>In the classic build versus buy debate, the company began building its own, then it met the FeaturePeek team and decided to switch course. &#8220;We had a team working on a prototype when the founders of FeaturePeek, Eric and Jason, gave us a demo of their product. As the demo progressed, our jaws got increasingly closer to hitting the floor and we knew straight away that what we had just seen was miles away from both our internal prototypes and any of the other tools we had seen in the space,&#8221; Billman told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;It also quickly became apparent that fully building towards this vision as two different companies, without a deep end-to-end experience from initial Pull Request to a new feature release, would never really allow us to build what we were dreaming of, so we decided to join forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>The companies&#8217; combined effort actually comes together today in a new release of Deploy Previews that includes the new FeaturePeek collaboration/commenting capabilities.</p>
<p>FeaturePeek was founded in 2019, went through Y Combinator Summer 2019 batch, and raised around $2 million. Netlify was founded in 2014 and has raised over $97 million, according to Crunchbase. Its last raise was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/netfily-nabs-53m-series-c-as-micro-services-approach-to-web-development-grows/"> a $53 million Series C</a> in March 2020.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This morning, we're going over Squarespace's recently disclosed Q2 and full-2021 guidance. Then we'll ask how its expectations compare to its reference price-defined pre-trading valuation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s Squarespace direct-listing day, and the SMB web hosting and design shop&#8217;s reference price has been set at $50 per share.</p>
<p>According to quick math from the <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/81903/Squarespaces-NYSE-reference-price-is-set-at-$50-ahead-of-Wednesdays-direct-">IPO-watching group Renaissance Capital</a>, Squarespace is worth $7.4 billion at that price, calculated using a fully diluted share count. The company&#8217;s new valuation is sharply under where Squarespace raised capital in March, when it added $300 million to its accounts at a $10 billion post-money valuation, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/squarespace-series-unknown--34dd8c02">according to Crunchbase data</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>The company&#8217;s reference price, however, is just that: a reference. It doesn&#8217;t mean that much. As we&#8217;ve seen from other notable direct listings, a company&#8217;s opening price does not necessarily align with its formal reference price. Until Squarespace opens, whether it will be valued at a discount to its final private price is unclear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spotify-ipo/spotify-shares-jump-in-record-setting-direct-listing-idUSKCN1HA12B"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>While the benefits of a direct listing are understood, the post-listing performance for well-known direct listings is less obvious. Indeed, Coinbase is currently under its reference price after starting its life as a public company at a far-richer figure, and Spotify&#8217;s share price is middling at best compared to its 2018-era direct-listing reference price.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re going over Squarespace&#8217;s recently disclosed Q2 and full-2021 guidance. Then we&#8217;ll ask how its expectations compare to its reference price-defined pre-trading valuation. Finally, we&#8217;ll set some stakes in the ground regarding historical direct-listing results and what we might expect from the company as it adds a third set of data to our quiver.</p>
<p>This will be lots of fun, so let&#8217;s get into the numbers!</p>
<h2>Squarespace&#8217;s Q2</h2>
<p>Per Squarespace&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.squarespace.com/blog/squarespace-releases-financial-outlook-2021">own reporting</a>, it expects revenues between $186 million and $189 million in Q2 2021, which it calculates as a growth rate of between 24% and 26%. That pace of growth at its scale is perfectly acceptable for a company going public.</p>
<p>For all of 2021, Squarespace expects revenues of $764 million to $776 million, which works out to a very similar 23% to 25% growth rate.</p>
<p>In profit terms, Squarespace only shared its &#8220;non-GAAP unlevered free cash flow,&#8221; which is a technical thing I have no time to explain. But what matters is that the company expects some non-GAAP unlevered free cash flow in Q2 2021 ($10 million to $13 million), and lots more in all of 2021 ($100 million to $115 million).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The three co-founders of <a href="https://www.thegistsports.com">The GIST</a> are all themselves sports fans, but realized in 2018 that sports media in general left a lot to be desired when it comes to catering to audiences outside of the traditional, male-dominated stereoptyical sports audience. So they started a new kind of sports media enterprise, taking a risk on a very different kind of careers vs. their background in financial services in Toronto.</p>
<p>On the back of impressive 350% audience through 2020, c-founders Jacie DeHoop, Ellen Hyslop and Roslyn McLarty have now raises an initial $1 million round of seed funding, form investors including 3GP Capital, JDS Sports, August Group, Even Odds Investments, and Bettor Capital. The company also just got approved for a $350,000 loan from the Business Development Bank of Canada, bringing its total new funding across venture and state-backed credit incentives to $1.35 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the sports industry, as you probably are aware, less than 4% of coverage is on female athletes, and less than 14% of sports journalists are women,&#8221; explained McLarty, who is also The GIST&#8217;s head of finance, operations and growth. &#8220;It&#8217;s no wonder, as women, we don&#8217;t necessarily resonate with the the more traditional male-dominated sports media and the way that sports is represented. So we were finding it hard to be a part of that community sports can provide, and around the same time, we were seeing a trend of media companies developing these more authentic relationships with their audience, and building community and being built a little bit more ground up, and that being really effective.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>McLarty cites other media ventures including theSkimm, Morning Brew and The Hustle as examples of what her and her co-=foudners saw was working well in media. That approach, combined with what they saw as a massive potential untapped audience, led to the creation of The GIST, which because as a newsletter and has evolved into a news site, a podcast and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started with the purpose of making sports more accessible, inclusive, approachable and fun for a casual fan, or a female fan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;For anyone really, that hadn&#8217;t resonated with traditional sports media.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked McLarty why her and her co-founders wanted to get into the media business specifically, given that their experience prior to that was on Bay Street, which is effectively Toronto&#8217;s equivalent of Wall Street. She admitted that it took the trio some time to find their footing, but that now the business has opened up a new and growing audience that basically wasn&#8217;t served previously, which is helping them win over advertisers and brand partnerships.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve discovered an audience that is really valuable, and there hasn&#8217;t really been a way for brand partners to engage with a female audience through sports,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve kind of found our niche, and have built really built things out and gotten to the point where we are today in a really lean lean way. The hard part was the initial investment in the audience to get it to the point where it is now, but once you hit that scale in the audience, the margins on the newsletter are obviously awesome for every additional person that we add on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The GIST&#8217;s partners include brands like the NBA, FanDuel, Red Bull and Adidas, to name a few, and it says its revenue is up over 1,000% this year vs. the year prior, on course to meet its goal of $1 million in total revenue for 2021. The company says it will be using the new funding to grow the team, including new hires on the content side, as well as additional headcount on the sales and operation teams, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ro, a digital elective care and telemedicine provider <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/ro-raises-500m-to-grow-its-remote-and-in-home-primary-care-platform/">last valued at $5 billion</a>, announced today that it has acquired Modern Fertility, a reproductive health company founded in 2017.<a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/1395010948117712896"> Axios estimates</a> it sold for $225 million in a majority-stock deal. TechCrunch has learned that the deal was &#8220;north&#8221; of $225 milliion.</p>
<p>Ro, also founded in 2017, has spent the past few years growing its business to be far more than its launched purpose: a solution for men with erectile dysfunction. It has since expanded into women’s health, smoking cessation, and treats over 20 conditions, including sexual health but also into weight loss and allergies. The acquisition of a business that focuses on women’s health will likely fit squarely into Rory, Ro’s women’s healthcare business that focuses on online visits, contact-free delivery and “healthcare without the waiting rooms.”</p>
<p>With the acquisition, Ro said that it is adding fertility testing and reproductive health to its women’s health suite of services, a product that has grown 300% last year in revenue. Similarly, in Q1 2021, Modern Fertility grew about 300% in revenue compared to the year prior. Modern Fertility co-founders Afton Vechery and Carly Leahy will lead that vertical for Ro.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Modern Fertility is offering a comprehensive fertility test for women who hope to be moms someday&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/modern-fertility-is-offering-a-comprehensive-fertility-test-for-women-who-hope-to-be-moms-someday/embed/#?secret=Wgkell0QgP" data-secret="Wgkell0QgP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Beyond the fact that this is one of the biggest exits for a women’s health company with a focus on reproductive care, today’s acquisition is important because it’s another step in a healthcare system that is built on an entirely “cash-pay, no insurance” model. Since inception, Ro has bet that the future of healthcare can be built on out-of-pocket expenses, and that consumers are willing to pay directly to access a doctor instead of going through the hurdles of traditional insurance. That, of course, comes with missing out on the currently insured, which is still a large subset of Americans.</p>
<p>However, if the deal goes as planned, Modern Fertility entering the Ro umbrella might make the overall business have yet another pitch to consumers to use its service. Consumers are lazy, and if you can give them one place to get all their services &#8212; maybe even starting with fertility &#8212; it becomes a stickier and stickier operation. Other companies such as Everlywell and Future Family have similarly proven the market out there for comprehensive fertility solutions.</p>
<p>Plus, you can see how today’s deal jibes well with Ro’s <a href="https://medium.com/ro-co/welcome-workpath-63fa52177f11">December 2020 acquisition</a> of Workpath. Workpath is an in-home care API that allows Ro to create a vertically integrated primary care platform, so it can send professionals to a patient’s home or conduct diagnostic tests.</p>

<p>As far as acquisitions go for Ro, while last year was a broad bet on how to bring care services to others, this year is a new, niche bet on which care services will be most important to consumers going forward. Since Ro has raised nearly $900 million in venture capital raised to date, expect more in the M&amp;A front as the months roll on by.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction technology may not be the sexiest of industries, but it is one where tremendous opportunity lies &#8212; considering it has historically lagged in productivity. And, lags in productivity means project delays, which typically costs everyone involved more time and more money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of larger players in the space (think Procore, PlanGrid and Autodesk) that are tackling the problems from the perspective of the general contractor. But when it comes to the subcontractors that are hired by the general contractor to do 95% of the work, the pickings are few and far between.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="https://www.assignar.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cloud-based construction tech startup that was originally born in Australia and is now based in Denver, Colorado. Co-founder and CEO Sean McCreanor was a contractor himself for many years, and grew frustrated with the lack of offerings available to him. So, as in the case of many founders, he set out to create the technology he wished existed.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, Assignar has raised $20 million in a Series B funding round led by real estate tech-focused venture firm Fifth Wall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backer Tola Capital and new investor Ironspring Ventures also put money in the round, which brings Assignar’s total raised since its 2014 inception to $31 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had 100 crews and workers out in the field, lots of heavy equipment and project work, and was running the entire business on spreadsheets and whiteboards,” McCreanor recalls. “With Assignar, we essentially help the office connect to the field and vice versa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Assignar’s operations platform is designed for use by “self-perform general and subcontractors” on public and private infrastructure projects. The company’s goal is to make the whole process smoother for large general contractors, developers and real estate owner-operators by providing a “real-time snapshot of granular field activity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Assignar aims to streamline operations and schedules, track crews and equipment, and improve quality and safety, as well as measure and monitor productivity and progress with data on all projects. For example, it claims to be able to help match up the best crews and equipment for a specific job &#8220;more efficiently.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says it has hundreds of international customers working on multibillion-dollar projects in infrastructure, road, rail, heavy civil, utilities and other construction disciplines. Those customers range from specialist contractors with as few as five crews to multi-national, multibillion-dollar companies. Projects include things such as bridges and roads, for example.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154435" style="width: 3061px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154435" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2154435 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="3051" height="1884" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg 3051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=768,474 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=1536,948 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=2048,1265 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3051px) 100vw, 3051px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2154435" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Assignar</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignar historically has “more than doubled” its revenue every year since inception and in 2020, saw revenue increase by 75%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We could have grown faster but wanted to manage cash flow,” McCreanor told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignar’s focus is particularly significant these days considering that the Biden administration&#8217;s Infrastructure Bill is nearing agreement, likely signaling an investment in infrastructure for communities across the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heavy civil and horizontal construction industry has long lacked a well-designed and ubiquitous operations platform, according to Fifth Wall Partner Vik Chawla.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Assignar&#8217;s cloud-based software offers a detailed view on when and where different types of field activities are being performed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It streamlines communications between headquarters and the field, allows for a reduction in paperwork, and brings time and cost savings to an industry where much of the planning, tracking and reporting are still done by hand, in Excel or on white boards.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignar plans to use its new capital to grow its business in North America (which currently makes up about 25% of its revenue) and double its 65-person team by hiring for roles across all departments. The company also plans to invest in R&amp;D and product development to further build out its core platform. Among the features it’s planning to develop is a contractor hub and a schedule recommendation engine that McCreanor says will leverage data, AI and machine learning “to support planning and execution processes.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://amperecomputing.com/">Ampere</a>, the server startup that is betting on bringing Arm-based chips to the data center and edge, is hosting its annual media day today. With the 80-core Altara and 128-core Altra Max, the company already offers a platform that can rival and outperform those of competitors like Intel and AMD in many common scenarios &#8212; and Altra Max is now in production and shipping. Those chips are based on the standard ARM Neoverse N1 architecture, though. But now, it is about to launch its own custom  Ampere Cores, built on a 5nm process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Altra and Altra Max are based on the N1 core from Arm. We&#8217;re an architecture licensee as well as an IP licensee, so we&#8217;re going to talk about our own core [at our media day]: what we built, how we built it, why we built it,&#8221; Ampere CEO Renee James, who spent 26 years at Intel before founding Ampere, told me. &#8220;And what does a cloud-native processor look like? We like to think about it like you think about M1 for a PC from Apple, you would think about an Ampere Core for a cloud data center server.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the 128-core Altra Max, Ampere promises a chip that uses 50% less power per core compared to an AMD Rome CPU and performance gains of 1.6x for running the NGINX web server, for example. And all of those benchmarks look even better when compared to an Intel Cascade Lake Refresh CPU. AMD&#8217;s Rome launched in August 2019 and Intel&#8217;s Cascade Lake Scalable Performance Refresh CPU have been in the market since last February.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about developing that CPU that&#8217;s built for the cloud and making sure that we&#8217;re meeting the new &#8212; but not really not new anymore &#8212; but kind of the current and future needs of cloud-native workloads, that software development model, and that type of infrastructure deployment model,&#8221; Ampere&#8217;s CPO Jeff Wittich said. &#8220;Which for us really means developing a product that has high performance that&#8217;s very predictable across workloads across users and a very, very scalable platform for compute, memory, I/O, network, and that is very, very power efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154521" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154521" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2154521" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="518" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg 1663w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=768,389 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=1536,778 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-185320.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154521" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ampere</p></div></p>
<p>Wittich noted that Ampere had always planned to develop its own cores, in part because it offers a very specific product for a very specific use case. &#8220;We knew that from the start developing our own cores was going to be very, very important for us to innovate in the ways that we need to innovate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have to say the primary thing is that because we&#8217;re focused on cloud &#8212; and we&#8217;re not focused on a bunch of other markets, especially not client, and also not other markets, even within the server space &#8212; it means developing a core that&#8217;s specific to cloud is really important to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ampere&#8217;s cloud customers want certain built-in security features and manageability features for performance and power, for example. And as Wittich stressed, those have to be built in at the micro-architecture level to work properly (and this allows the company to optimize performance, as well).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to build our own cores to actually have a processor that does what the cloud wants,&#8221; he said. The Ampere Cores will, for example, feature high I/O memory bandwidth, for example, but optimized for cloud use cases, not high-performance computing use cases.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154524" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154524" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2154524" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="520" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-18-191512.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154524" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ampere</p></div></p>
<p>James echoed this, noting that customers want these features and Ampere&#8217;s competitors will offer them. &#8220;The cloud business is pretty specific and the customers are very demanding,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So cadence is really important and we are competing against customers who have really very good products.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems like this strategy is working out well for Ampere, which now counts the likes of Microsoft, Oracle and Tencent Cloud among its customers. Rumor has it that Microsoft is working on its own Arm-based chips as well, but interestingly, the company is also using Ampere&#8217;s media day to talk about how it is readying Azure for Altra.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The podcasting world remains one of the most vibrant formats in media (and I am not just saying that since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/techcrunchs-equity-podcast-wins-a-webby-award/">the Equity crew won a Webby yesterday for our not-that-humble podcast</a>). Its openness, diversity, freedom and ease-of-authoring has broadened the medium to all sorts of hosts on every subject imaginable.</p>
<p>We experience that dynamism and verve in our own audio listening, but then we start to tune into our company’s internal communications, and, well, you certainly don’t need sleeping pills to zone out. Top-down, formal, banal — corporate comms remains mired in a 1950s way of speaking that is completely out-of-sync with the millennials and Gen Z majority of workers who expect something actually worth watching and listening to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getspokn.com">Spokn</a> wants to make company-wide podcasting a must-listen event, not just for leaders to talk to their employees, but for every worker to have a voice and share their expertise and stories across their workplaces. Through its app, companies can deliver personalized podcast feeds on everything from a daily standup or weekly AMA to training and development content, all of which is secure and kept for internal use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s an idea that has quickly attracted investor attention. The startup, which was part of Y Combinator’s most recent Winter 2021 batch, closed on a $4 million seed round two weeks before Demo Day led by Ann Bordetsky, a partner at NEA <a href="https://www.nea.com/news/press-releases/nea-welcomes-ann-bordetsky-and-sheila-lirio-marcelo-to-its-technology-investing-team">who joined earlier this year</a> and previously served as COO of Rival. This is her first investment with the firm.</p>

<p>The company was founded by Fawzy Abu Seif, Mariel Davis and Mohammad Galal Eldeen. Abu Seif and Davis met each other in an Egyptian jazz club in November 2017, about a week after he had quit his job. They eventually came together not just as a couple — they got married in the fall of 2019 — but as business partners, linking up with Galal Eldeen and incorporating Spokn in April 2018.</p>

<p>Spokn’s product evolved across three iterations. First, the team tried to create audio narrations of evergreen content at major publishers like The New York Times. The idea was to help publishers reuse their best content as a new revenue source while connecting more listeners into these brands. Getting publishers to commit was tough though. “The consumer app wasn’t doing that great, and we started hunting around the data to see if something was working,” Davis said.</p>
<p>What they found was that professional development podcasts were much more popular compared to other topics, and so they had an opportunity to re-jigger the product to focus on training and specifically target enterprises. The idea was “let’s empower companies with the same tools we had as a consumer company,” Abu Seif said.</p>

<p>Prior to Spokn, Davis had worked with an entrepreneur in the Middle East building out a social enterprise network focused on skills training, a role in which she handled internal communications. She saw just how little impact media like email made for employees, particularly in the distributed workforce she was attempting to engage. The new direction for Spokn was far more enticing.</p>
<p>The newly married couple moved to New York City from Egypt and signed an apartment lease in early March 2020 — just as the COVID-19 pandemic spread widely in the region. We “multiplied the living expenses by 8-10x while doing the same Zoom calls we could make from there,” Abu Seif joked.</p>
<p>Eventually, the company realized that it could do much more than just training, and expanded into broader internal comms. “Async audio is a lot more personal than email,” Abu Seif said. This latest product iteration launched in November 2020, and included push notifications, an app for streaming, personalization features and analytics to allow companies to track what was working and what was not for employees.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, companies can tailor the access lists for individual podcasts to particular groups of people, such as senior execs, people managers, sales employees or any other logical grouping. We “get a lot of inbound from companies that are trying to duct-tape solutions together,” Davis said. For Abu Seif, “all the tools that marketers have to engage consumers, we are empowering companies to engage with their employees.”</p>
<p>Despite the startup and product’s youth, it has attracted a quick following among companies, with customers including Podium, ShipBob, Cedar, Mixpanel, ServiceNow and Superhuman. Podium’s CEO, for example, records weekly podcasts that are shipping on Spokn, and apparently even installed a podcast studio near his office just to make it easier to produce his shows.</p>
<p>Podcasting inside companies fixes a lot of problems with traditional internal comms. First and foremost, it can create a deeper connection where email cannot. Audio can feel more personal than even video, and also can be played in the background. It’s also asynchronous, unlike live video, allowing employees in different time zones to connect with key stories at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>Plus, employees can avoid all the fatigue that comes from being onscreen. “No one wants Zoom zombies,” Bordetsky of NEA said. “We need intuitive and asynchronous communication tools like Spokn to build connection and community in the workplace.” Her thesis for the investment is that “flexible, distributed work is here to stay and employee communication is at the heart of building a modern, virtual-first employee experience.”</p>

<p>Buyers of Spokn range from heads of people to sales teams, and the company is also focused on recruiting and retention as well. “Companies are pretty freaked out about retaining their great talent,” Davis said. Some companies are now sharing “stories with prospects even before their first day at the company.”</p>
<p>While the product is mostly used by leaders today, Spokn wants to expand that remit to employees talking with their peer colleagues, helping to build community in hybrid offices where it is harder than ever to make a connection with others.</p>
<p>Of course, companies can screw up podcasting just as much as they have screwed up every other medium to communicate like humans, and Davis says it’s become her full-time job to help them think through storytelling and how to connect better with their own employees. We “work to find the right storytellers in the company,” she said.</p>
<p>Outside NEA, other investors in the seed round included Reach Capital, Funders Club, Liquid2, Share Capital, SOMA Capital, Scribble VC and Hack VC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All batteries degrade over time. For automakers, fleet managers and other companies, the crux — and key to profitability — is knowing when they will.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s surprisingly difficult to understand the health and status of a battery without extensive and expensive testing, which isn&#8217;t always possible once a battery is in a vehicle. German battery analytics software company <a href="https://twaice.com/">Twaice</a> has been taking aim at this problem since its founding in 2018, and it announced Wednesday that it has raised $26 million in Series B funding led by Chicago-based Energize Ventures. The company, which primarily works in the mobility and energy storage industries, now has a total financing of $45 million.</p>
<p>“We started Twaice with the focus on building a battery analytics platform which really covers the whole lifecycle of battery systems,” company co-founder Stephan Rohr told TechCrunch, including the development and operational phases. The company has launched tools that are suited for the design and development phase and when the battery is actually in a vehicle or energy storage system. Audi, Daimler and Hero Motors are some of its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company intends to use this fresh round of funding to expand its European commercial footprint and possibly into the United States. It also wants to build even more use cases on top of its analytics platform &#8212; for example, working with fleet providers, rather than only the manufacturers.</p>
<p>One of the company’s innovations is a concept of a “digital twin,” or a simulation model of the battery system that runs in Twaice&#8217;s cloud platform. The company continually updates the parameters of the &#8220;twin&#8221; so that it reflects the behavior of the actual battery, down to its thermal characteristics, electrical behavior and degradation. That means companies that operate a fleet of EV buses can monitor the state of the battery packs of each of their vehicles.</p>
<p>“It enables not just a focus on the current health of the battery system, but also it enables us to simulate and forecast the future,” Rohr said.</p>
<p>Twaice also offers solutions before the battery even enters the vehicle or energy storage system. “Battery design engineers use our simulations to reduce the testing effort [. . .] assess charging strategies, assess depth of discharge, assess different cell chemistries,” Rohr explained.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Battery analytics software startup Twaice raises €11M Series A led by Creandum&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/battery-analytics-software-startup-twaice-raises-e11m-series-a-led-by-creandum/embed/#?secret=ZyfnCJcmKH" data-secret="ZyfnCJcmKH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One major use case for Twaice&#8217;s software is for warranty tracking and safety risks. Using battery analytics OEMs can understand where exactly the battery failed, whether in the cell or the module, for example, and also gain valuable data on future warranty claims based on previous data. Warranties are huge risks for OEMs, Lennart Hinrichs, Twaice&#8217;s commercial director, explained to TechCrunch, in part because batteries are so complex and difficult to understand once they’re in a vehicle.</p>
<p>But having a grasp on the battery’s life could come in handy for consumers as well. Twaice has partnered with TÜV Rheinland, a testing and certification institute in Germany that’s working on EV resale in the private market. It could eventually lead the way to a standard assessment process for batteries on the resale market.</p>
<p>Once the battery is no longer suited for its first-life application, companies can use Twaice&#8217;s software to assess the remaining life and health of the battery system and determine whether it’s fit for a second-life purpose or if it should go straight to recycling.</p>
