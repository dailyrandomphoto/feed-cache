</div><p id="speakable-summary">The world of hybrid work is here, and the usual 10-minute intro call, swag bag and first-day team lunch are just not enough to make your new employee feel welcome.</p>
<p>While many companies have found a way to interview and select candidates in a fully remote environment, fewer have spent time and resources on aligning the “pre-boarding” and onboarding process for the new hybrid world of work. Many employers still rely on old ways of welcoming new hires, despite our totally changed work environment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It’s important to capitalize on candidates’ enthusiasm and eagerness from the moment the offer is signed, instead of when they log in on Day One.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In our experience at Greenhouse, where we help companies as diverse as BuzzFeed, HubSpot and Intercom hire talent across their organization, first impressions can make or break a candidate’s chances of staying at a company.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/dont-underestimate-the-importance-of-effective-onboarding.aspx">69%</a> of employees will stay for more than three years if their onboarding experience is good, while <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/reducing-new-employee-turnover-among-emerging-adults.aspx">20%</a> will leave within 45 days if it&#8217;s bad. That difference is costly, as it takes, on average, around <a href="https://www.shrm.org/about-shrm/press-room/press-releases/pages/human-capital-benchmarking-report.aspx">$4,129 and 42 days to fill a position</a>.</p>
<p>Replacing someone can cost up to 50%-60% of their annual salary. At the same time,<a href="https://www.saplinghr.com/10-employee-onboarding-statistics-you-must-know-in-2021"> 58% of organizations</a> said they were guilty of centering their onboarding processes on administrative and paperwork requirements alone.</p>
<p>Here is how we advise our clients to set up every new hire for success right from the start.</p>
<h2>The company’s Day One comes long before the candidate’s Day One</h2>
<p>Most of us can remember the excitement (and anxiety) of receiving and signing an offer for a new job. It’s important to capitalize on candidates’ enthusiasm and eagerness from the moment the offer is signed, instead of when they log in on Day One.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/">RevenueCat</a>, a startup offering a series of tools for developers of subscription-based apps, has raised $40 million in Series B funding, valuing its business at $300 million, post-money. Founded by developers who understood the difficulties in scaling a subscription app first-hand, RevenueCat&#8217;s software development kit (SDK) solution gives companies the tools they need to build a subscription business, including not just adding subscriptions themselves, but maintaining them over time even as the app stores implement changes. It also aids by sharing subscription data with other tools the business uses, like those for advertising, analytics or attribution.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Y Combinator&#8217;s Continuity Fund and included participation from Index Ventures, SaaStr, Oakhouse, Adjacent, and FundersClub, as well as Blinklist CTO Tobias Balling and Algolia CEO Nicolas Dessaign. With the round, YC Continuity Partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anuhariharan/">Anu Hariharan</a> is joining RevenueCat&#8217;s board, which today includes Index&#8217;s Mark Fiorentino in addition to the founders.</p>
<p>Explains RevenueCat CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeiting/">Jacob Eiting</a>, the idea for the company came about after he and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelcarranza/">Miguel Carranza Guisado</a> (CTO) struggled to figure out subscription infrastructure while working together at Elevate. After years of untangling a &#8220;subscription mess&#8221; in order to figure out answers to basic questions like subscriber retention and lifetime value, they realized there was potential in helping solve this problem for other developers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple and Google, Eiting explains, aren&#8217;t always up to date with what companies actually need to build subscription businesses. &#8220;They&#8217;re kind of learning as they go. They just weren&#8217;t able to provide us the data we needed, and then also the infrastructure to do that is non-trivial.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157214" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157214" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2157214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="357" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=2048,1075 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevenueCat_series_b-2-1.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157214" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RevenueCat</p></div></p>
<p>When Eiting and Guisado sat down to work on on RevenueCat in 2017, no one else was even building anything like this. But the demand for the startup&#8217;s tools and integrations soon resonated with developers who had faced similar challenges it the growing subsection app market.</p>
<p>Using the service, developers can access a real-time dashboard that display key metrics, like subscription revenue, churn, <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/lifetime-value/">LTV</a> (lifetime value), subscriber numbers, conversions and more. The data can then be shared through integrations with other tools and services, like Adjust, Amplitude, Apple Search Ads, AppsFlyer, Branch, Facebook Ads, Google Cloud Intercom, Mixpanel, Segment, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/integrations">and several others. </a></p>
<p>After launching out of Y Combinator&#8217;s accelerator the following year, RevenueCat was soon live with 100 apps and had crossed $1 million in tracked revenue by the time it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/"> raised its $1.5 million seed round. </a></p>
<p>Today, RevenueCat has over 6,000 apps live on its platform, with over $1 billion in tracked subscription revenue being managed by its tools. That&#8217;s double the number of apps that were using its service <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/revenuecat-secures-15m-series-a-for-app-subscription-platform/">as of its $15 million Series A last August</a>.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, the company will lower its pricing to put its tools in reach of more developers. Previously, it charged $120 per month for its charts and some of its integrations, or $499 per month for access to all integrations. This was affordable for larger companies, but could still be a difficult sell to the long tail of app developers where revenues ranged from $10K to $50K per month.</p>
<p>Now, RevenueCat will charge a small percentage of an app&#8217;s sales instead of a flat fee. Developers with up to $10,000 in monthly tracked revenue (MTR) can get started with the service for free and as their demands grow &#8212; like needing access to charts, support for web hooks, integrations and others &#8212; they can <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/pricing">move up to either the Starter or Pro plans</a> as $8/mo or $12/mo per $1,000 in MTR, respectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to give those tools to developers, especially on the small end, because it might be what they need to get out of that &#8216;less than $10K range,'&#8221; Eiting says. &#8220;Also, the beauty of freemium, or having a really generous free tier, is that it makes your tool the de facto &#8212; you remove as much friction as possible for providing software services and then, if you get your pricing right &#8212; which I think we have &#8212; it all kind of pays for itself,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The company also plans to use the new funds to further invest in its business, expanding from App Store and Google Play support to include Amazon&#8217;s Appstore. It will also grow its team.</p>
<p>As part of its expected growth, RevenueCat recently hired a Head of Product, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jefago/?originalSubdomain=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jefago/?originalSubdomain%3Dde&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621973532621000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7Vb2goPqCDEnTBUMXq5s97FbUAg">Jens-Fabian Goetzmann</a>, previously a PM at Microsoft and then product head at fitness app 8fit. Currently 30 people, in the year ahead, RevenueCat will grow to 60 people, <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/revenuecat">hiring</a> across design, product, engineering, sales and other roles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world is moving toward subscriptions — and for companies, building out this model translates to weeks of developers’ time,&#8221; says YC Continuity&#8217;s Hariharan. &#8220;RevenueCat helps developers rollout subscriptions in minutes and creates a source of truth for customer data. With developers creating solutions to problems in the world, it’s important that they can find ways to monetize, grow, and support their most committed customers. RevenueCat is doing so by building subscriptions 2.0.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston-based <a href="https://www.filtered.ai/">Filtered.ai</a> has raised a $7 million round to accelerate its hiring cadence, and built out the go-to-market model for its <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">its engineering and developer-focused hiring service, it recently announced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TechCrunch caught up with the company to discuss not only why it decided to leave bootstrapping behind, but also to dig into how its service could widen the market for some technical roles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup was born back in 2016 out of a need when its founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/deliber8prakts?lang=en">Paul Bilodeau</a> started to work on it as an internal project while employed at a consultancy. Filtered later split from the consulting group in 2019, signing a term sheet to raise capital in March of 2020. Then COVID-19 arrived, and things got a bit turbulent.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But before we get lost in the money side of things, let&#8217;s talk about what the company does.</p>
<p>Filtered&#8217;s product is interesting as it could help shake up a hiring system for technical roles for startups that is rife with bias and wasted time. If you are friends with any developers, for example, or data scientists, you are aware of how not-good their hiring process can be.</p>
<p>To pick two issues: Resumes are often a pretty poor indicator of talent, and on-site whiteboard sessions are super unpopular. Filtered is taking on both by providing <em>skills-based</em> take-home tests with AI aboard to help detect fraud. The hiring company can play back those sessions to see how candidates approached problems. Filtered also allows companies to ask candidates open-ended interview questions via video, removing the need for formulaic phone screens that are only good for providing full-employment to junior HR staff.</p>
<p>Filtered claims that its system can get companies to the point of making offers more quickly.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all well and good, but what TechCrunch was most curious about was what the startup&#8217;s service might manage when it comes to making hiring more equitable. If it&#8217;s more skills-focused than resume-centric, does that shake up who gets hired? It does, the company thinks. Once resumes lose some of their luster, and candidates are vetted on skills over keyword optimization in their applications, &#8220;diversity just happens,&#8221; Bilodeau explained.</p>
<h2>The round</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s get back to the money. The timing of Filtered&#8217;s anticipated venture capital round and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were unfortunately timed rather close to each other.</p>
<p>So, Bilodeau told TechCrunch in an interview that his startup effectively raised capital on a drip basis throughout 2020, until it finally closed its round in the fourth quarter of the year. That timing was somewhat fortuitous for its investors &#8212; <a href="https://svdcapital.com/">Silicon Valley Data Capital</a> and <a href="https://aifund.ai/">the AI Fund</a> &#8212; as Filtered&#8217;s CEO said that that was the company&#8217;s best quarter in its history.</p>
<p>From bootstrapping to taking on capital, what changed at Filtered that led it to decide to raise external funding? Per Bilodeau, he didn&#8217;t want to raise money. And he said that crowing about fundraising news is somewhat nonsensical, likening it to sharing on LinkedIn that he took out a mortgage on a house.</p>
<p>But as Filtered wanted to hire proactively instead of when it closed a new deal, picking up new funds made sense. The startup also wanted to work more on its marketing efforts, shake up its pricing and move toward a land-and-expand model from an enterprise sales focus. More money would make all of that a bit easier, so it took on capital.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we&#8217;re hoping that Filtered can somehow quantify the impact it has on hiring diverse folks for technical roles. If it&#8217;s material, that could be even more exciting than rapid revenue growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian said that deliveries of the R1T Launch Edition, the limited edition release of its first series of “electric adventure vehicles,” will be delayed by a month, according to an update on its website.</p>
<p>Customers who preordered can now expect to start receiving their pickup trucks in July instead of June, with Launch Edition deliveries to be completed by Spring 2022. The change was first spotted by the Rivian Forum. The one-month delay was due to a combination of small issues, including delays on shipping containers, the ongoing chip shortage as well as ensuring the servicing piece is properly set up, a Rivian spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The Amazon-backed EV startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/rivian-to-begin-deliveries-of-electric-pickup-truck-in-june-2021/">told preorder holders in July 2020</a> to expect deliveries of the truck in June 2021, with R1S electric SUV deliveries starting two months later in August. The delivery timeline has already been extended once, after Rivian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/rivian-shuts-down-all-facilities-over-covid-19-pandemic-concerns/">suspended construction work</a> on its factory due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rivian is working to maintain the August delivery time of the R1S, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Despite the delay, it looks like Rivian will still be first to bring an electric truck to market among both new EV entrants and legacy automakers. Lordstown Motors CEO Steve Burns said in an investor call last week that deliveries for the company’s “Endurance” truck are still on track for September (despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">slashing production numbers in half</a>). Ford’s F-150 Lighting, the electric version of its nameplate pickup, is expected in 2022. And Tesla recently confirmed that its Cybertruck will start production late this year.</p>
<p>Rivian also said it will be starting its drive program in August, which will let customers schedule at-home drives or attend a tour event. The company will be releasing details on launch dates and reservations for the tour events in the coming weeks. Rivian selected Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Detroit and Seattle as the first batch of cities on the tour.</p>
<p>In addition, it released a few product updates. Customers now have the option to add an Off-Road Upgrade to their vehicle configuration for an additional $2,000. Every Rivian will now also come with an onboard air compressor, previously available only with the Off-Road Upgrade.</p>
<p>Customers can also add Rivian Adventure Gear to their configuration. These include a rooftop tent, cargo bars, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/rivians-camp-kitchen-in-action/">camp kitchen</a> (that now comes with a 30-piece kitchen set).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mmhmm/">mmhmm</a>, the communications platform developed by Phil Libin and the All Turtles team, is getting a variety of new features. According to Libin, there are parts of video communication today that can not only match what we get in the real world, but exceed it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how this next iteration of mmhmm is meant to deliver.</p>
<p>The new headline feature is mmhmm Chunky, which allows the presenter to break up their script and presentation into &#8220;chunks.&#8221; Think of the presenter the same way you think of slides in a deck. Each one gets the full edit treatment and final polish. With Chunky, mmhmm users can break up their presentation into chunks to perfect each individual bit of information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A presenter can switch between live and pre-recorded chunks in a presentation. So you can imagine a salesman making a pitch and switching over to his explanation of the pricing as a pre-recorded piece of his pitch, or a teacher who has a pre-recorded chunk on a particular topic can throw to that mid-class.</p>
<p>But mmhmm didn&#8217;t just think about the creation side, but also the consumption side. Folks in the audience can jump around between chunks and slides to catch up, or even view in a sped-up mode to consume more quickly. Presenters can see where folks in the audience are as they present or later on.</p>
<p>Libin sees this feature as a way to supercharge time.</p>
<p>&#8220;At mmhmm, we stopped doing synchronous updates with our fully distributed team,&#8221; said Libin. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have meetings anymore where people take turns updating each other because it&#8217;s not very efficient. Now the team just sends around their quick presentations, and I can watch it in double speed because people can listen faster than people can talk. But we don&#8217;t have to do it at the same time. Then, when we actually talk synchronously, it&#8217;s reserved for that live back-and-forth about the important stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>mmhmm is also announcing that it has developed its own video player, allowing folks to stream their mmhmm presentations to whichever website they&#8217;d like. As per usual, mmhmm will still work with Zoom, Google Meet, etc.</p>
<p>The new features list also includes an updated version of Copilot. For folks who remember, Copilot allowed one person to present and another person to &#8220;drive,&#8221; or art direct, the presentation from the background. Copilot 2.0 lets two people essentially video chat side by side, in whatever environment they&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>Libin showed me a presentation/conversation he did with a friend where they were both framed up in Libin&#8217;s house. He clarified that this feature works best with one-on-one conversations, or, one-on-one conversations in front of a large audience, such as a fireside chat.</p>
<p>Alongside mmhmm Chunky, streaming and Copilot 2.0, the platform is also doing a bit of spring cleaning with regards to organization. Users will have a Presentation Library where they can save and organize their best takes, and organizations can also use &#8220;Loaf&#8221; to store all the best videos and presentations company-wide for consumption later. The team also revamped Presets to make it easier to apply a preset to a bunch of slides at once or switch between presets more easily.</p>
<p>A couple other notes: mmhmm is working to bring the app to both iOS and Android very soon, and launch out of beta on Windows.</p>
<p>Libin explained that not every single feature described here will launch today, but rather you&#8217;ll see features trickle out each week as we head into summer. He&#8217;ll be giving a keynote on the new features <a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/events/#welcome-to-mmhmm-summer">here</a> at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most marketers today know how to send targeted communications to customers, and there are many tools to help, but when it comes to sending personalized in-house messages, there aren&#8217;t nearly as many options. <a href="https://www.pynhq.com/">Pyn</a>, an early stage startup based in Australia wants to change that, and today it announced an $8 million seed round.</p>
<p>Andreesen Horowitz led the investment with help from Accel and Ryan Sanders, the co-founder of BambooHR and Scott Farquar, co-founder and co-CEO at Atlassian.</p>
<p>That last one isn&#8217;t a coincidence as Pyn co-founder and CEO Joris Luijke used to run HR at the company and later at Squarespace and other companies, and he saw a common problem trying to provide more targeted messages when communicating internally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to do this my entire professional life, trying to personalize the communication that we&#8217;re sending to our people. So that&#8217;s what Pyn does. In a nutshell, we radically personalize employee communications,&#8221; Luijke explained. His co-founder Jon Williams was previously a co-founder at Culture Amp, an employee experience management platform he helped launch in 2011 (and which raised over $150 million), so the two of them have been immersed in this idea.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="F6rjlFuXcX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/create-a-handbook-and-integrate-ai-to-onboard-remote-employees/">Create a handbook and integrate AI to onboard remote employees</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Create a handbook and integrate AI to onboard remote employees&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/create-a-handbook-and-integrate-ai-to-onboard-remote-employees/embed/#?secret=F6rjlFuXcX" data-secret="F6rjlFuXcX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>They bring personalization to Pyn by tracking information in existing systems that companies already use such as Workday, BambooHR, Salesforce or Zendesk, and they can use this data much in the same way a marketer uses various types of information to send more personalized messages to customers.</p>
<p>That means you can cut down on the company-wide emails that might not be relevant to everyone and send messages that should matter more to the people receiving them. And as with a marketing communications tool, you can track how many people have opened the emails and how successful you were in hitting the mark.</p>
<p>David Ulevitch, general partner at a16z, and lead investor in this deal points out that Pyn also provides a library of customizable communications materials to help build culture and set policy across an organization.&#8221;It also treats employee communication channels as the rails upon which to orchestrate management practices across an organization [by delivering] a library of management playbooks,&#8221; Ulevitch wrote in a blog post announcing the investment.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched in 2019, currently has 10 employees with teams working in Australia and the Bay Area in California. Williams says that already half the team is female and the plan is to continue putting diversity front and center as they build the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joris has mentioned &#8216;radical personalization&#8217; as this specific mantra that we have, and I think if you translate that into an organization, that is all about inclusion in reality, and if we want to be able to cater for all the specific needs of people, we need to understand them. So [diversity is essential] to us,&#8221; Williams said.</p>
<p>While the company isn&#8217;t ready to discuss specifics in terms of customer numbers, it cites Shopify, Rubrik and Carta as early customers, and the founders say that there was a lot of interest when the pandemic hit last year and the need for more frequent and meaningful types of communication became even more paramount.</p>

Now that Acorns has decided to list via a SPAC &#8212; more on that in a moment &#8212; we do.</p>
<p>So this morning, we&#8217;re unpacking <a href="https://sqy7rm.media.zestyio.com/Project-Oak-Press-Release_5_27_Final.pdf">the Acorns deal</a> and <a href="https://sqy7rm.media.zestyio.com/Acorns-Investors-Webcast.pdf">its investor deck</a>, but we&#8217;re also trying to better understand why venture capitalists have poured so very much money into the space and the resulting economic picture that arises from the companies that they have funded. Acorns is our test subject, then.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start with a quick overview of its SPAC-led deal before getting into its results. Into the breach!</p>
<h2>The Acorns SPAC deal</h2>
<p>If your eyes are blurring as we review yet another SPAC transaction&#8217;s details, I get you. Let&#8217;s be brief. Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acorns is merging with Pioneer Merger Corp., a public blank-check company.</li>
<li>Acorns CEO Noah Kerner and &#8220;Pioneer&#8217;s sponsor&#8221; are each giving 10% of their equity to select customers.</li>
<li>When combined, the entity will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol OAKS.</li>
</ul>
<p>You know, the thing you plant <em>acorns</em> to grow. Har har.</p>
<p>Here are the financial details of the transaction, via the company&#8217;s investor deck:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe&#8217;s lead data protection regulator has opened two investigations into EU institutions&#8217; use of cloud services from U.S. cloud giants, Amazon and Microsoft, under so called Cloud II contracts inked earlier between European bodies, institutions and agencies and AWS and Microsoft.</p>
<p>A separate investigation has also been opened into the European Commission&#8217;s use of Microsoft Office 365 to assess compliance with earlier <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/investigations/outcome-own-initiative-investigation-eu_en">recommendations</a>, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) said today.</p>
<p>Wojciech Wiewiórowski is probing the EU&#8217;s use of U.S. cloud services as part of a wider compliance strategy <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2020/strategy-eu-institutions-comply-schrems-ii-ruling_en">announced</a> last October following a landmark ruling by the Court of Justice (CJEU) &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">aka, Schrems II</a> &#8212; which struck down the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/more-legal-uncertainty-for-privacy-shield-ahead-of-crux-ruling-by-europes-top-court/">EU-US Privacy Shield data transfer agreement</a> and cast doubt upon the viability of alternative data transfer mechanisms in cases where EU users&#8217; personal data is flowing to third countries where it may be at risk from mass surveillance regimes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iFcRkAmRH5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/embed/#?secret=iFcRkAmRH5" data-secret="iFcRkAmRH5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In October, the EU&#8217;s chief privacy regulator asked the bloc&#8217;s institutions to report on their transfers of personal data to non-EU countries. This analysis confirmed that data is flowing to third countries, the EDPS said today. And that it&#8217;s flowing to the U.S. in particular &#8212; on account of EU bodies&#8217; reliance on large cloud service providers (many of which are U.S.-based).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s hardly a surprise. But the next step could be very interesting as the EDPS wants to determine whether those historical contracts (which were signed before the Schrems II ruling) align with the CJEU judgement or not.</p>
<p>Indeed, the EDPS warned today that they may not &#8212; which could thus require EU bodies to find alternative cloud service providers in the future (most likely ones located within the EU, to avoid any legal uncertainty). So this investigation could be the start of a regulator-induced migration in the EU away from U.S. cloud giants.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Wiewiórowski said: &#8220;Following the outcome of the reporting exercise by the EU institutions and bodies, we identified certain types of contracts that require particular attention and this is why we have decided to launch these two investigations. I am aware that the &#8216;Cloud II contracts&#8217; were signed in early 2020 before the &#8216;Schrems II&#8217; judgement and that both Amazon and Microsoft have announced new measures with the aim to align themselves with the judgement. Nevertheless, these announced measures may not be sufficient to ensure full compliance with EU data protection law and hence the need to investigate this properly.”</p>
<p>Amazon and Microsoft have been contacted with questions regarding any special measures they have applied to these Cloud II contracts with EU bodies.</p>
<p>The EDPS said it wants EU institutions to lead by example. And that looks important given how, despite a public warning from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/no-grace-period-after-schrems-ii-privacy-shield-ruling-warn-eu-data-watchdogs/">last year</a> &#8212; saying there would be no regulatory grace period for implementing the implications of the Schrems II judgement &#8212; there hasn&#8217;t been any major data transfer fireworks yet.</p>
<p>The most likely reason for that is a fair amount of head-in-the-sand reaction and/or superficial tweaks made to contracts in the hopes of meeting the legal bar (but which haven&#8217;t yet been tested by regulatory scrutiny).</p>
<p>Final guidance from the EDPB is also still pending, although the Board put out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">detailed advice last fall</a>.</p>
<p>The CJEU ruling made it plain that EU law in this area cannot simply be ignored. So as the bloc&#8217;s data regulators start scrutinizing contracts that are taking data out of the EU some of these arrangement are, inevitably, going to be found wanting &#8212; and their associated data flows ordered to stop.</p>
<p>To wit: A long-running complaint against Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers &#8212; filed by the eponymous Max Schrems, a long-time EU privacy campaigners and lawyer, all the way back in 2013 &#8212; is slowing winding toward just such a possibility.</p>
<p>Last fall, following the Schrems II ruling, the Irish regulator gave Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">a preliminary order to stop moving Europeans&#8217; data</a> over the pond. Facebook sought to challenge that in the Irish courts but<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows/"> lost its attempt to block the proceeding</a> earlier this month. So it could now face a suspension order within months.</p>
<p>How Facebook might respond is anyone&#8217;s guess but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">Schrems suggested</a> to TechCrunch last summer that the company will ultimately need to federate its service, storing EU users&#8217; data inside the EU.</p>
<p>The Schrems II ruling does generally look like it will be good news for EU-based cloud service providers which can position themselves to solve the legal uncertainty issue (even if they aren&#8217;t as competitively priced and/or scalable as the dominant US-based cloud giants).</p>
<p>Fixing U.S. surveillance law, meanwhile &#8212; so that it gets independent oversight and accessible redress mechanisms for non-citizens in order to no longer be considered a threat to EU people&#8217;s data, as the CJEU judges have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">repeatedly found</a> &#8212; is certainly likely to take a lot longer than &#8216;months&#8217;. If indeed the US authorities can ever be convinced of the need to reform their approach.</p>
<p>Still, if EU regulators finally start taking action on Schrems II &#8212; by ordering high profile EU-US data transfers to stop &#8212; that might help concentrate US policymakers&#8217; minds toward surveillance reform. Otherwise local storage may be the new future normal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic rendered us homebound, the houseplant industry was </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/11/indoor-plant-sales-boom-reflecting-urbanisation-and-design-trends"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already in bloom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One year sequestered in our homes later, and our living spaces have flourished into our personal indoor gardens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An app that uses machine learning to help people care for their plants, Greg announced today that it has received $5.4 million in seed funding. This round is led by Index with participation from First Round Capital. Greg is also backed by a team of expert angels and advisors, including Elie Seidman (previous CEO of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/vaccinated-badges-free-boosts-tinder-bumble-okcupid-blk-chispa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tinder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Eliza Blank (founder of </span><a href="https://www.thesill.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a plant delivery service), and Darryl Cheng (a “</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/houseplantjournal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plant-stagrammer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” with 600k followers). Currently, Greg&#8217;s remote team has 11 members and <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/gregarious">plans to hire</a> a Head of Brand and at least five more engineers, including a Senior Android Engineer (so far, the app is only available on iOS). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primarily, Greg works by telling people when to water their plants – that’s not something you can just set a weekly reminder for, since every plant is a bit different. Greg’s recommendations are tailored to each plant’s species, geographic location, sun exposure, and proximity to a window. This makes it easy for anyone to keep their greenery thriving in any circumstance. There’s also a discover feed built into the app, where users can share photos of their plants, which have names like “Keanu Leaves” and “Michelle Branch.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2158250" style="width: 404px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158250" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2158250 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg_screenshot2.jpg?w=394" alt="" width="394" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg_screenshot2.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg_screenshot2.jpg?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg_screenshot2.jpg?resize=174,300 174w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg_screenshot2.jpg?resize=394,680 394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg_screenshot2.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158250" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://greg.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For CEO, co-founder, and engineer Alex Ross, plant care is more than just a pandemic hobby. Gregarious, Inc. – the company behind Greg – was founded as a public benefit corporation. In a legally-binding </span><a href="https://greg.app/charter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the team promises to produce a positive effect (“or a reduction of negative effects” – that’s where we’re at with climate change) within Earth’s ecosystems. The company&#8217;s charter outlines three goals: developing original technology and research to deepen our understanding of plant life; acting as stewards of the planet&#8217;s health; and creating opportunities for all forms of life to thrive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plants are a really great vehicle for understanding how the planet works,” said Ross. “That’s one of our core reasons for starting Greg. We believe that more people need to understand how ecosystems work, how plants work, and how our food system works in order for us to make better decisions as a society in the next 10 or 20 years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t Ross’s first experience with mission-driven entrepreneurship. As a Director of Engineering at Tinder, he created the Trust &amp; Safety team, which is responsible for keeping the dating app’s users safe from abuse. There, he saw the potential for consumer mobile apps to build an audience. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tinder was actually on the leading edge of trust and safety products,&#8221; said Ross. &#8220;I wanted to work on the part of Tinder that had a clear public benefit. Now [with Greg], the public benefit is the point.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Since its public launch on the app store in October 2020, Greg has sprouted 50,000 monthly active users. These green thumbs have added 350,000 plants across 4,000 different species, which they’ve interacted with over 2 million times. The app’s methodology is based on the UN Food &amp; Agriculture Organization’s algorithm for estimating crop water use. Every interaction helps Greg’s AI get smarter – whether that’s taking photos, watering a plant, or even snoozing watering recommendations. The more data that Greg’s AI interprets, the more it learns about the most effective and efficient ways to grow plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We hope within a number of years to be contributing back to that UN Food &amp; Agriculture Organization algorithm to make it easier for farmers in developing countries to be able to take that algorithm and grow higher yield produce for their food systems,” said Ross. “That’s why we started as a public benefit corporation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross says that the biggest challenge facing Greg is that people don’t know about it yet. So, the app partnered with plant retailers like House Plant Shop and American Plant Exchange to share promotion codes for its subscription tier, Super Greg. Subscribers pay $6.50 per month, $2.50 per month annually, or $49.99 for lifetime access, which allows them to add unlimited plants to Greg – the free version only lets you add five plants, which may not be sufficient for the budding botanists among us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s been a great source of user acquisition,” Ross says. Once on the app, they can better understand the fickle ecosystems of their plants. “We think Greg can play a role in onboarding people. Coinbase onboards people into crypto, Greg onboards people into plants.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ross also compared Greg’s model to an app like Waze – as more users report traffic patterns, the app can increasingly benefit other drivers in their area. In the same vein, as Greg learns more about plant maintenance, the company can use that data to fulfill its eco-friendly mission. The company hopes to eventually build an “extremely scaled out platform” that understands more about how plants work than any existing technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Greg is benefitting its users on a smaller scale, especially as many parts of the world remain in lockdown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do believe plants are almost objectively good for mental wellness,” Ross said. “I’ve never seen somebody go from having plants to not having plants.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://airspacelink.com">Airspace Link</a> is today announcing it raised a $10 million Series A from Altos Ventures, Thales, and others. The Detroit, Michigan-based startup anticipates using the additional funds to expand its domestic offering and expand overseas.</p>
<p>CEO Michael Healander explains to TechCrunch that the company sees airspaces as digital infrastructure lacking critical regulations. &#8220;Today you have rules and regulations on the road,&#8221; he says, explaining that the company is building digital roads and management for drones. Airspace Link&#8217;s novel platform addresses drone operators&#8217; and communities&#8217; concerns, enabling pilots to safely fly while complying with local airspace restrictions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158234" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158234" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2158234" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/city-editor-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/city-editor-1.png 1260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/city-editor-1.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/city-editor-1.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/city-editor-1.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/city-editor-1.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/city-editor-1.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158234" class="wp-caption-text">Airspace Link’s AirHub<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is the first cloud-based drone platform focused exclusively on merging the needs of state &amp; local government with the operational planning tools pilots already use.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Airspace Links offers drone operation planning tools, including API access that allows developers to incorporate Airspace Link&#8217;s data into third-party platforms. The company&#8217;s system complies with the FAA&#8217;s Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC), enabling drone pilots to submit operations while flying in controlled airspace. The company is one of seven FAA-approved companies to provide this service.</p>
<p>With the Series A funding, Healander says the goal is to integrate with as many transportation groups as possible.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Michael Healander, Daniel Bradshaw, and Ana Healander, the Detroit-based startup employs 20 full-time staff. The company says in a press release that it has partnerships with over 40 government agencies and municipalities in the United States. Going forward, the company is looking to expand to Australia and Canada.</p>
<p>According to Healander, what distinguishes Airspace Link from the other competitors in the market is its integration with mapping tools used by municipal governments to provide information on ground-based risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our core purpose is to safely integrate drones into the national airspace and our communities at scale,&#8221; said Healander. &#8220;We thank Altos Ventures and Thales for joining our vision of paving the way for the drone economy with shared, neutral, and affordable UAS infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Healander, Airspace Link is only the latest entrepreneurial venture. He previously founded GeoMetri, an indoor GPS tracking company, which was acquired by Acuity Brands.</p>
<p>Altos Ventures led Airspace Link&#8217;s Series A round, with participation from Thales, a global leader of air traffic management systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) usage continues to grow, for safe, low altitude operations around communities, airspace management must combine both air and ground insights,&#8221; said Todd Donovan, Thales Vice President, Airspace Mobility Solutions Americas. &#8220;Our deep knowledge of airspace management and Airspace Link&#8217;s expertise in geospatial intelligence are the perfect combination to address this complex challenge.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bird is rolling out a next-generation scooter with a bigger, longer-range battery and a diagnostic monitoring system to New York and Berlin this summer, as the micromobility startup seeks out ways to improve its margins and ultimately become profitable.</p>
<p>The Bird Three, which is already available in Tel Aviv, is designed to last longer and require less maintenance as well as improve comfort and safety for customers, according to the company. The launch comes just a week after Bird announced a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Switchback II. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">regulatory filings</a> that accompanied the announcement demonstrated just how difficult it is to turn a profit given the unit economics of shared scooters.</p>
<p>The cost of building and servicing vehicles is one of the biggest barriers to profitability, which explains why Bird has invested in developing a scooter with a longer-lasting vehicle and battery as well as the software needed to monitor the device&#8217;s health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bird writes its own proprietary operating system, called Bird OS, as well as its motor controller IoT system, according to Scott Rushforth, Bird&#8217;s chief vehicle officer. The self-diagnostics system allows the battery to communicate with the backend and internally within the connected vehicle network. That means if, for example, the machine gets too warm, it&#8217;ll send the server an alert and will also automatically correct itself by riding at a slower speed to keep cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s tons of health monitoring and data that comes off the battery,&#8221; Rushforth told TechCrunch. &#8220;Every individual cell is monitored. There&#8217;s probably about 75 different diagnostics that we track within the battery system itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Superpedestrian, which recently lost a bid for New York City&#8217;s first e-scooter pilot to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot/">Bird, Lime and Veo</a>, has touted its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/superpedestrian-positions-itself-as-the-go-to-partner-for-cities-with-new-e-scooter-safety-upgrades/">self-diagnostics software and in-house written OS</a> as one of its USPs for years. The company boasts that its LINK scooters, which are powered by its Vehicle Intelligent Safety (VIS) system, run 1,000 vehicle health checks every second a ride is taking place, checking for things like battery cell temperature imbalances, water penetration and brake issues.</p>
<p>Bird&#8217;s batteries are encased in &#8220;hermetically sealed, tamper-proof, industry-leading IP68-rated protection to keep [them] safe from dust, water and theft,&#8221; according to the company, which also claims the battery on the Bird Three is the largest in the industry at 1kWh capacity. Superpedestrian, a company that shares Bird&#8217;s aversion to swappable batteries, has just about the same battery capacity at .986kWh, according to a spokesperson for the company. Lime, Bird&#8217;s biggest competitor, has gone the small, swappable battery route, and thus its battery capacity is .460kWh, according to a Lime spokesperson.</p>
<p>Lime and other companies that use swappable batteries argue this strategy generates less emissions because the scooters can be serviced by gig economy workers on ebikes. Scooters have traditionally been rounded up, charged and then redistributed to public streets by gig economy workers driving around in gas-powered vans.</p>
<p>With its latest scooter, Bird is doubling down on the big, static battery strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The battery is so big that we don&#8217;t really need to charge it very often, and it can go 15,000 to 20,000 miles before it has any type of serviceability event,&#8221; said Rushforth, who noted in major markets, Bird&#8217;s scooters are being charged roughly once a week. &#8220;We spend less time charging, less time rebalancing, less time going out and having to do maintenance and chase these vehicles around, which means we&#8217;re actually using less cars than you would generally when you have swappable batteries and have to go out all the time to swap them.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far it&#8217;s not clear which strategy is the most eco-friendly, but a sustainable scooter isn&#8217;t all about the battery. Rushforth says the Bird Three is designed to last 24 to 36 months on the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to make the most green vehicle in the world, and to accomplish that, the system needs to be extremely durable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As long as the vehicles last longer, we need less vehicles overall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because Bird Three is built on the same platform as Bird Two, many of the parts are the same which makes it easier to reduce, reuse and recycle at the end of the vehicle&#8217;s life. Once a battery reaches the end of its life, Bird turns to partners like ITAP to be responsibly recycled.</p>
<p>Other updates on the Bird Three revolve around comfortability and safety, including a new braking system with front and rear brakes and an automatic emergency braking that detects a fault in the mechanical braking system and digitally stops the vehicle using the motor.</p>
<p>Rushforth also noted that the vehicle ergonomics feel sturdier, with a longer wheelbase, wider handlebars and antimicrobial grips. The Bird Three has a new headlight and taillight that are globally certified so they can be used in places like Germany where scooters have more stringent requirements. Just in time for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bird-to-spend-150-million-on-european-expansion-plan/">Bird to expand outward into Europe</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to buy a house in a competitive market is perhaps one of the most stressful things an adult can go through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competing with a bunch of people all putting offers on a house that fly off the market in a matter of days is not fun. One startup that is trying to give home buyers a competitive edge by giving them a way to offer all cash on a home has just raised a boatload of money to help it keep growing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin-based <a href="http://www.homeward.com">Homeward</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which aims to help people buy homes faster, announced t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oday it has raised $136 million in a Series B funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners at a valuation “just north of $800 million.” The company has also secured $235 million in debt.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackstone, Breyer Capital and existing backers Adams Street, Javelin and LiveOak Venture Partners also participated in the equity financing, which brings Homeward’s total equity raised since inception to $160 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeward’s model seems to be appealing to both home buyers (including first time ones) and agents alike, with lots of growth occurring since May 2020 when it raised $105 million in debt and equity. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures but noted that its GMV (gross merchandise value) run rate is up over 600%+ year over year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as of March, Homeward says it had experienced a 5x increase in the volume of homes transacted and 9x year over growth in the number of new customers. Plus, It’s hired 161 employees since January alone, and currently has a headcount of 203, up from about 33 at this time last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Tim Heyl founded the real estate startup in late 2018 on the premise that in most cases, sellers prefer to receive all cash offers because they are more likely to close. Loans can fall through, but cash is cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heyl started the company after having worked in the industry for the previous decade, first as a broker then as the owner of a title company. During that time, he saw firsthand many of the problems in the industry. And one conundrum he frequently ran into was people not wanting to make an offer on a home without knowing for sure their current house would sell in a certain amount of time. This is a dilemma many are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic as demand outweighs supply in many major U.S. cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic has greatly increased demand for our product,” Heyl told TechCrunch. “It’s a historic seller’s market with unprecedented demand from buyers and the lowest inventory levels in decades.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to “double down” on its offering, scale up to meet &#8220;outsized demand” and open additional markets. Currently, Homeward operates in Texas, Colorado and Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, we have a waiting list in every market across the country, so this growth capital will enable us to meet that demand,” Heyl said. Its ultimate goal is to open its offering to agents nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeward also plans to double the size of its title and mortgage teams in the latter half of the year so it can offer its clients and partner agents “a single streamlined experience.” It’s also planning to integrate its consumer and internal software systems for approvals, offers and closing “so everyone can be on a single platform and we can eliminate confusion and waste,” Heyl added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how does it work exactly? Homeward will make an all-cash offer on behalf of a customer wanting to buy a house. Meanwhile, that customer can hire an agent (from brokerages such as Redfin or Keller Williams) to list their home with less pressure to sell it in a certain amount of time or at a discounted price. Once Homeward buys a home, it will lease the property back to its customer until they sell their house, get a mortgage, and can buy the property back from Homeward. During the process, Homeward offers a predetermined guaranteed price for its customer’s home with the promise that if it’s unable to sell the house for at least that amount, it’ll buy the house from them.</span></p>
<p>The company charges the buyer a &#8220;standard convenience fee,&#8221; which varies by state and service. The buyer can get a closing credit when they use the company&#8217;s mortgage services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heyl believes Homeward’s “alternative iBuyer” model is a better deal for customers since it doesn’t purchase a customer’s old home for below market value. The company also works with agents, and not against them, he said. For example, its offerings are available to any agent, but the company “strategically” partners with top brokerages and teams, providing them with what it describes as “dedicated support, white-label branding, and digital marketing tools to help them stand out from the crowd and attract more clients.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most alternatives to traditional real estate minimize or replace the agent,” Heyl said. “But we are agents ourselves, and we’ve built this for agents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeward is profitable on a per unit basis if you count transaction revenue minus costs to acquire and complete each transaction, according to Heyl. However, it is not yet profitable on a net income basis.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvp.com/team/jeff-crowe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Crowe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners, will join Homeward’s board as part of the funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Homeward is innovating at the intersection of real estate and fintech — that’s the next frontier,” he said. “H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">omeward’s cash offer addresses real problems for homebuyers in all market conditions, and the team has identified a winning strategy by partnering with agents and their clients.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital describes Homeward as one of Austin&#8217;s most innovative companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are inspired by the company&#8217;s mission to build home finance solutions to overcome the limitations of the traditional mortgage and we are proud to support them as they continue to scale rapidly and efficiently,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The digital health space continues cooking on gas: Berlin-based <a href="https://ada.com">Ada Health</a> has closed a $90M Series B round of funding led by Leaps by Bayer, the impact investment arm of the German multinational pharma giant, Bayer AG. Other investors in the round include Samsung Catalyst Fund, Vitruvian Partners, Inteligo Bank, F4 and Mutschler Ventures.</p>
<p>The startup last raised around four years&#8217; ago, reporting a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/berlins-ada-health-raises-47m-to-become-the-alexa-of-healthcare/">$47M Series A round in 2017</a>. But don&#8217;t be fooled by the low lettering of these rounds: Ada Health has been working on its symptom assessment tech for around a decade at this point &#8212; relying, in the first several years of its mission, on private funding from high net worth individuals in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tiFJws9lRy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/move-slow-and-dont-break-things-how-to-build-an-ai-driven-startup/">Ada Health built an AI-driven startup by moving slowly and not breaking things</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ada Health built an AI-driven startup by moving slowly and not breaking things&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/move-slow-and-dont-break-things-how-to-build-an-ai-driven-startup/embed/#?secret=tiFJws9lRy" data-secret="tiFJws9lRy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Initially it was also focused on building a decision support tool for doctors before pivoting to directly addressing patients via an AI-driven symptom assessment app.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not alone in offering this type of tool. Others in the space include Babylon, Buoy, K Health, Mediktor, Symptomate, WebMD and Your.MD &#8212; but Ada claims its app is the most used and highest rated by users. It can also point to a <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/12/e040269">peer reviewed study</a> it led, which was published in the BMJ, and compared the condition coverage, accuracy and safety of eight competitors. The study found its app led the pack on all fronts.</p>
<p>One reason for that edge is that Ada Health&#8217;s medical knowledge base covers around 30,000 ICD-10 codes (aka the alphanumeric codes used by doctors to represent different diagnoses) at this point &#8212; which co-founder and CEO, Daniel Nathrath, tells us is &#8220;by far the largest coverage of any of the systems in this space&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Ada Health app, which launched in late 2016 &#8212; and remains free to use &#8212; has been downloaded by more than 11 million people across 150 countries so far. Users have completed some 23M assessments using the tool which he likens to having &#8220;24/7 access to your trusted family doctor&#8221;.</p>
<p>Currently, the app has support for 10 languages. But the goal with the funding is to push for truly massive scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to help as many people as possible get better access to healthcare around the world,&#8221; Nathrath tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Our ambition is, in a few years, that a billion people instead of 11M people will be using out technology. In order to get there we think that working with the right investors can help us accelerate that growth path and give more people the benefit of our technology faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With 11M app downloads I believe we are the most used AI symptom assessment technology that I know of in the world,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;We are also the most rated and reviewed app in the medical category of the App Store and Google Play Store ever &#8212; after, what, just four years. With about 300,000 ratings and reviews, most of them five-star. So&#8230; we have gained some users but we think it&#8217;s just the beginning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital health &#8212; with all the things you see going on &#8212; is at an inflection point where it&#8217;s being realized not only by the users who have already been using our technology but also by health systems, governments, and payers, insurers, and life sciences companies &#8212; I think everyone has realized digital health is here to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as putting its symptom assessment app directly in the hands of patients, Ada Health offers a suite of enterprise solutions where partners pay it to be able to embed and deeply integrate its triage technology into their websites and digital services. That means they can use it to offer an entry point for their users &#8212; to help direct them to the correct service and provide administrative support by arming clinicians with health information provided by patient via the Ada interface (and the AI&#8217;s own assessment) ahead of the appointment.</p>
<p>One publicly disclosed customer for Ada&#8217;s enterprise offering is Sutter Health, in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have integrated Ada into their own homepage and into their app so people can use it as a digital front door to the entire service of Sutter,&#8221; says Nathrath, explaining that the difference vs the version of the app that patients can download is &#8220;people don&#8217;t just get generic advice&#8221;. &#8220;It&#8217;s fully integrated. So if it says &#8212; for instance &#8212; you need to go to the emergency room&#8230; then you can go straight into appointment booking.</p>
<p>&#8220;And not only that; when you book the appointment the outcome of the Ada pre-assessment can then be shared with the health professional who will then look at you so the doctor doesn&#8217;t start from a blank sheet of paper but is already pre-briefed and gets decision support in terms of &#8216;this is constellation of symptoms the patient is reporting&#8217; and &#8216;based on that these could be the most likely diagnosis and these should be the tests, examinations or investigations I should consider next to get to the confirmed diagnosis&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The added advantage for Ada&#8217;s enterprise partners is that patient data arrives with the doctor that sees them already structured so &#8212; after a few confirmations &#8212; they can easily import it into their documentation, saying precious minutes per patient, per Nathrath. &#8220;[If] you save a few minutes with each patient that means you have more time for the patients who really need you and not the patients who maybe has a cold and shows up in the emergency room, which unfortunately is a reality,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>With this enterprise strand of its business Ada is continuing to provide support for doctors. Nathrath suggests its patient-facing app is also being used for some informal decision support for doctors too.</p>
<p>More and more doctors are using the app &#8220;together with their patients&#8221;, he tells us, or else recommending it to their patients &#8212;  asking them &#8220;so what did Ada say?&#8221;.</p>
<p>The role of AI in healthcare will be a core one, Nathrath predicts &#8212; given that demand for healthcare professionals is always going to outstrip supply.</p>
<p>He argues that&#8217;s true even with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kry-closes-312m-series-d-after-use-of-its-telehealth-tools-surged-100-yoy/">rising use of telehealth platforms</a> which can certainly make more efficient use of doctors&#8217; time.</p>
<p>Ada did, at one point, offer a telehealth service itself &#8212; before deciding to fully focus its efforts on AI &#8212; so its approach now is to partner and integrate with other healthcare and health data providers throughout the care ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there&#8217;s a place for telehealth, obviously. It adds convenience. During the pandemic I guess it had a special role where for many it was almost the only way to interact with a doctor,&#8221; he says. &#8220;So we do see a place for telehealth but we also see an issue with telehealth in that it doesn&#8217;t address the structural issue in healthcare &#8212; that simply there aren&#8217;t enough doctors to serve the entire population of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building Ada as a multi-sided platform,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be computing different sources of input data &#8212; which is sensor data, wearables data, lab data, genetic testing data &#8212; that&#8217;s on the input side &#8212; and then on the more downstream, on the next step after Ada, we can partner with any telehealth company in the world. And we&#8217;re seeing enormous interest from literally all corners of the world where telehealth companies approach us. And insurance companies and governments &#8212; where they say yes there is a use-case for telehealth but we basically need something before that, that filters people to the right next step.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever that right next step is in a patient&#8217;s care journey, &#8220;Ada is like the gatekeeper at the beginning of the journey that then sends you on your way,&#8221; is how Nathrath puts it.</p>
<p>The overarching vision is that Ada becomes not just an app in your pocket but an omnipresent &#8220;personal health companion&#8221; &#8212; or what it describes as &#8220;a personal operating system for health&#8221; &#8212; which is powerful enough to deliver preventative healthcare by being able to aggregate all sorts of data and spot health issues sooner so as to enable earlier and less costly interventions.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re building is really much more than a symptom assessment technology,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Where you would also take into account lab results which can now be done much more direct to consumer than was previously possible, sensors and wearables data &#8212; and you probably say that Samsung is one of our investors but we&#8217;re obviously talking to all the large players in the space about this; how we can integrate that data best &#8212; and all the way to genetic testing and even the full genome sequence.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you take all these different sources of health information and compute them against each other on a continuous basis you&#8217;ll have something like an early warning system for your health &#8212; which, again, from a population health and system level perspective should be desirable for anyone who&#8217;s in charge of providing healthcare or paying for healthcare because you can catch the problem when it&#8217;s still a £100 problem and not yet a £100,000 a year problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that ambition it&#8217;s interesting that big pharma is investing in Ada. (And its PR notes that it&#8217;s also in talks with Bayer on a potential strategic partnership.) But Nathrath suggests that the industry is well aware of the shifts being driven by digital health &#8212; and keen to avoid its own &#8216;Kodak moment&#8217;, i.e. by not adapting to the coming changes in a timely enough manner.</p>
<p>If AI-powered health interventions end up being so successful that they can shrink drug bills through earlier intervention and more preventative care then it makes good business sense for big pharma to be plugged into the cutting edge of digital health.</p>
<p>At the same time this type of tech might end up driving demand for medicines &#8212; exactly because of its scalability and because it can present a higher dimension view of more people&#8217;s health &#8212; meaning there&#8217;s more opportunity for increased prescription. So there&#8217;s not really a downside for pharma to get involved here.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really excited about the possibilities we can find by working together [with pharmaceutical companies] to really deliver a better healthcare experience to patients,&#8221; says Nathrath. &#8220;If you look at Bayer they have a consumer health business, they also have a pharmaceutical business and if you look at the cases within Ada if you look at the top ten most common ones it&#8217;s very comparable to what a GP would see all the time and a lot of those basically can end up in the recommendation towards healthcare where oftentimes an over the counter drug will be enough to address the issue. One area where Bayer has a lot of offerings, of course. But then their spectrum goes all the way towards rare diseases &#8212; where we&#8217;re also particularly strong. Where they have some drugs that help patients with very rare conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are also potentially major research riches to be derived from the health data generated via Ada&#8217;s app which could also be interesting to pharma companies doing drug discovery.</p>
<p>Although Nathrath emphasizes that app users&#8217; data is never used for research purpose without explicit consent from the individual (as is required under Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Act).</p>
<p>But he also notes that Ada is able to do some interesting studies based on aggregated user data, too &#8212; giving an example of how it looked at kids mental health during COVID-19 lockdowns, comparing areas where schools had been shut vs those where they had remained open. &#8220;You could really compare what happened in different countries,&#8221; he says, noting that rates of depression in kids in Germany where schools and pre-schools were closed went up by over 100%, whereas in Switzerland where schools remained opened throughout there was no rise and even a slight improvement in children&#8217;s mental health.</p>
<p>In another example, involving aggregated data from usage of the app in US, he says it was able to show that it could have spotted a measles epidemic via the cases in the app slightly sooner than the CDC&#8217;s official announcement of an epidemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about the potential of that, in terms of spotting outbreaks earlier, that can be quite significant,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there&#8217;s really a long list of ways we can work together [with researchers, policymakers and pharma companies] for the benefit of patients,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;The mission of all the people I spoke to at Bayer was really similar to ours &#8212; which is to help people, basically&#8230; That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re really happy to work with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Dr. Jürgen Eckhardt, head of Leaps by Bayer, added: “Investing in breakthrough technologies that drive digital change in healthcare is one of the strategic imperatives for Leaps by Bayer and for the entire field of healthcare. Ada’s truly transformative technology, combining powerful artificial intelligence with an emphasis on medical rigor and high levels of clinical accuracy will lead the way in helping more patients and consumers in achieving better health outcomes sooner by intervening earlier in their healthcare journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.wayflyer.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayflyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a revenue-based financing platform for e-commerce merchants, has raised $76 million in a Series A funding round led by Left Lane Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Partners” of DST Global, QED Investors, Speedinvest</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and Zinal Growth &#8212; the family office of Guillaume Pousaz (founder of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Checkout.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; also put money in the round. The raise comes just after Wayflyer raised $100 million in debt funding to support its cash advance product, and 14 months after the Dublin, Ireland-based startup launched its first product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an e-commerce boom fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wayflyer is the latest in a group of startups focused on the space that has attracted investor interest as of late. The company aims to help e-commerce merchants “unlock growth” by giving them access to working capital (from $10,000 up to $20 million) so they can improve cash flow and drive sales. For example, more cash can help these merchants do things like buy more inventory in bulk so they can meet customer demand and save money. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a nutshell, Wayflyer uses analytics and sends merchants cash to make inventory purchases or investments in their business. Those merchants then repay Wayflyer using a percentage of their revenue until the money is paid back (plus a fee charged for the cash advance). So essentially, the merchants are using their revenue to get financing, hence the term revenue-based financing. The advantage, Wayflyer says, is that companies make repayments as a percentage of their sales. So if they have a slow month, they will pay back less. So, there&#8217;s more flexibility involved than with other mechanisms such as traditional bank loans.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=LJjuSbMyrh" data-secret="LJjuSbMyrh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder Aidan Corbett believes that in a crowded space, Wayflyer’s use of big data gives it an edge over competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corbett and former VC Jack Pierse spun Wayflyer out of a marketing analytics company that Corbett had also started, called Conjura, in September 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jack came to me and said, ‘You should stop using our marketing analytics engine to do these big enterprise SaaS solutions, and instead use them to underwrite e-commerce businesses for short-term finance,’ ” Corbett recalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so he did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We just had our heads down and started repurposing the platform for it to be an underwriting platform,” Corbett said. It launched in April 2020, doing about $600,000 in advances at the time. In March of 2021, Wayflyer did about $36 million in advances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, it&#8217;s been a pretty aggressive kind of growth,” Corbett said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past six months alone, the company has seen its business grow 290% as it has deployed over $150 million of funding across 10 markets with a focus on the U.S., the United Kingdom and Australia. About 75% of its customers are U.S. based.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayflyer plans to use its new capital toward product development and global expansion with the goal of entering “multiple” new markets in the coming months. The company recently opened a sales office in Atlanta, and also has locations in the U.K., the Netherlands and Spain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Corbett, the company’s offering is more compelling than buy now, pay later solutions for consumers for example, in that it is funding the merchant directly and able to add services on top of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a lot more opportunity for companies like ourselves to differentiate because essentially, we focus on the merchants. And when we underwrite the merchant by getting data from the merchant, there&#8217;s a lot of additional services that you can put in on top,” Corbett explained. “Whereas with buy now, pay later, you get information on the consumer, and there&#8217;s not as much room to add additional services on top.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a business requests an advance and either is not approved for one, or doesn’t choose to take it, Wayflyer’s analytics platform is free to anybody who signs up to help them optimize their marketing spend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a critical driver of value for e-commerce businesses. If you can&#8217;t acquire customers at a reasonable price, you&#8217;re not going to be around very long. And a lot of early-stage e-commerce businesses struggle with that,” Corbett said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also can pair up a merchant with a marketing analytics &#8220;specialist” to analyze its marketing performance or an inventory &#8220;specialist&#8221; to look at the current terms and price a business is getting from a supplier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus from the very beginning is really supporting the merchants, not just providing them with working capital,” Corbett said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way the company claims to be different is in how it deploys funds. As mentioned above, merchants can pay the money back at varied terms, depending on how sales are going. The company makes money by charging a principal on advances, and then a “remittance rate” on revenues until the total amount is paid back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We tend to be more flexible than competition in this way,” Corbett said. “Also, some competitors will pay invoices on merchants’ behalf or give them a pre-charged card to use on advertising spend,” Corbett said. “We always give cash into a merchant’s account.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wayflyer recently inked an agreement with <a href="https://www.wayflyer.com/blog">Adobe Commerce</a>, a partnership it said would provide a new channel to further amplify its growth with the goal of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding 8,000 e-commerce businesses in the first year of the partnership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Left Lane Capital Partner </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Ahrens said that his firm was impressed by Wayflyer’s “nuanced understanding of what will drive value for their clients.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team’s focus, specialization, and deep analytical expertise within the e-commerce market also drives superior underwriting,” he told TechCrunch. “Their explosive growth has not come about by taking on undue risk. We are big believers that their underwriting will only improve with scale, and that Wayflyer will be able to compound its competitive advantages over time.”</span></p>
<p>As mentioned, this is an increasingly crowded space. Earlier this month, Settle announced it had raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Kleiner Perkins to give e-commerce and consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies access to non-dilutive capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter called the recent visit by police to its Indian offices a form of intimidation and said it was concerned by some of the requirements in New Delhi’s new IT rules.</p>
<p>Speaking for the first time since a special squad of Delhi police <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">made a surprise visit to two of its offices</a> on Monday, Twitter said it is “concerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve.”</p>
<p>The company also said that it joins many organizations in India and around the world that have “concerns with regards to the use of intimidation tactics by the police in response to enforcement of our global Terms of Service, as well as with core elements of the new IT Rules.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson added: “We plan to advocate for changes to elements of these regulations that inhibit free, open public conversation. We will continue our constructive dialogue with the Indian Government and believe it is critical to adopt a collaborative approach. It is the collective responsibility of elected officials, industry, and civil society to safeguard the interests of the public.”</p>
<p>Tension between American tech giants Twitter and Facebook and the Indian government has been brewing for months. Twitter faced heat from politicians after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">refused to block accounts</a> that criticised New Delhi’s reforms and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>India is one of the largest markets for American tech firms that poured billions of dollars in the South Asian nation in the past decade to get more people connected to the web. According to Indian government estimates, Twitter has 175 million users in India, while WhatsApp has amassed over 530 million users.</p>
<p>Their tension escalated Wednesday after WhatsApp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">sued the Indian government</a> in a court in Delhi over the new IT rules that it said would compromise users’ privacy and give New Delhi the power to conduct mass surveillance.</p>
<p>India announced the new IT rules in February and gave firms three months to comply. The deadline expired this week, and on Wednesday the Ministry of Electronics and IT <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/india-asks-social-media-firms-if-they-have-complied-with-the-new-regulations/">asked social media firms for an update on their compliant status</a>, TechCrunch first reported.</p>
<p>Twitter said Thursday that the new IT rules’ requirements to make a compliance officer criminally liable for content on the platform, proactive monitoring, and blanket authority to seek information about users represented a dangerous overreach that was inconsistent with open and democratic principles.</p>
<p>The microblogging platform also requested New Delhi to consider granting a minimum of 3 months extension to comply with the new IT rules and publish Standard Operating Protocols on aspects of compliance of public consultation.</p>
<p>Twitter said it was recently served with another non-compliance notice in India and withheld a portion of the content identified in the notice under. The content identified in the notice, Twitter said, was originally reported in the blocking orders since February 2021.</p>
<p>It said in recent months it has been compelled to withhold content in response to a non-compliance notice. Not doing so, it said, poses penal consequences with many risks for Twitter employees.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the company is committed to complying with the new IT rules. &#8220;It&#8217;s obviously early days and our local teams are very engaged. You know we comply with local laws and we will approach it with the same framework,&#8221; he said in a briefing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We engage and explain to everyone the importance of information, promoting free flow of information, but we do want to respect legislative processes in democratic countries. We are committed to complying,&#8221; he said, adding that the company will highlight any requests it complies with in its transparency reports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vidya Madhavan always wanted to be in business. Growing up in India, she thought she might be in the business of running a factory, given the power and influence of outfits like Tata Group, the Indian multinational conglomerate.</p>
<p>She certainly had an affinity for school, graduating at the top of her high school class, nabbing a mechanical engineering degree in India and more recently landing at Stanford&#8217;s business school. Except that instead of create the more traditional business she once had in mind, Madhavan found herself tinkering with an entirely different idea: a matchmaking app called <a href="https://www.schmoozedating.com/">Schmooze</a> that combines machine learning and memes to connect people based on what Madhavan calls a humor algorithm.</p>
<p>The idea dates back several years when, as an analyst with McKinsey in India who was debating whether or not to attend grad school in California, Madhavan cold-emailed 10 people on LinkedIn who had attended U.S. business schools for advice. Only one of them replied, but over the next couple of days, she says, &#8220;we exchanged, like, 200 emails, all of them fundamentally jokes.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reader, she is now married to that person. Indeed, she says it&#8217;s because she believes their shared sense of humor brought them together that she began tinkering with the idea of Schmooze, initially as a way to foster new friendships. It was when she saw the way things were trending &#8212; people were really looking for a love match &#8212; that she refocused the idea as a dating app for Gen Z users who already communicate largely with memes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FvrIfdjerY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/">Snack, a &#8216;Tinder meets TikTok&#8217; dating app, opens to Gen Z investors</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snack, a &#8216;Tinder meets TikTok&#8217; dating app, opens to Gen Z investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/embed/#?secret=FvrIfdjerY" data-secret="FvrIfdjerY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It has been taking off since, says Madhavan. Though it hasn&#8217;t yet spread Facebook-like across college campuses, a beta test in late summer with 200 Stanford students has since led to more than 10,000 downloads around the country, where people are swiping right &#8212; or left &#8212; to more than 5,000 memes that are culled entirely by still-in-beta Schmooze (until it&#8217;s big enough to deal with content moderation).</p>
<p>Currently about 200 memes are added each day, while others are deleted. &#8220;No one cares about the U.S. elections anymore,&#8221; Madhavan notes.</p>
<p>Using tagging and machine learning, combined with the bios that users create for themselves, Schmooze gets to work. Some users might show a predilection for particular topics, for example, like physics or finance. Some who say they&#8217;re interested in entrepreneurship might reveal an even stronger passion for music through their choices. There are similar divides when it comes to dark humor, and people who really love puns &#8212; and those who hate them.</p>
<p>Whether the algorithm truly works will take time, and lasting unions, to know. Madhavan says that 90,000 matches have been made to date, but naturally, a far smaller number have moved from matched to in-app messaging.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ERZ4l4H38j"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes/">Jigsaw scores $3.7M to slow down your dating swipes</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jigsaw scores $3.7M to slow down your dating swipes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes/embed/#?secret=ERZ4l4H38j" data-secret="ERZ4l4H38j" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Schmooze has plenty of competition in the meantime, both from traditional dating platforms and from newer apps and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/style/marriage-pact-college-stanford.html">questionnaires</a> that try pairing people based on share interests rather than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes/">looks</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also easy to imagine more meme-based dating apps suddenly springing into existence, particularly given today&#8217;s go-go market. (Crazier things have happened.)</p>
<p>Still, Schmooze appears to hold promise. It recently closed on $270,000 in seed funding from Ulu Ventures and others to tinker with its product. The company is finding success reaching its audience on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/foryou?is_from_webapp=v1&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;item_id=6960701703775669509#/@exactlyliketheothergirls/video/6960701703775669509">TikTok</a>. There is also a lot of money to be made in the world of online dating and its tiered-services business model, as industry watchers see <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/bumbles-14-bln-date-blackstone-backed-dating-app-soars-market-debut-2021-02-11/">over</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/match-group-seeks-expansion-beyond-dating-with-1point7-billion-acquisition-cfo.html">over</a> again.</p>
<p>As for Madhaven, she is in love, to her own surprise, with her five-person startup. Partly because of her formative years and partly because she never dated online before serendipitously meeting her husband through LinkedIn, she says with a laugh of Schmooze: &#8220;It&#8217;s unexpected, in many many ways.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Can an app improve your romantic relationships? The founders behind <a href="https://www.getpaired.com">Paired</a>, a &#8220;relationship care&#8221; app for couples, believe it can. And since launching in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/paired/">October</a>, with $1M to kick things off, they&#8217;ve convinced 5,000+ coupled-up others to try their custom blend of partner quizzes, &#8220;relationship satisfaction&#8221; tracking, and audio tips from experts &#8212; to try to feel closer to their S.O.</p>
<p>Paired is now gunning for serious growth: It&#8217;s announcing $3.6M in seed funding today, led by Eka Ventures with participation from existing investors including Taavet Hinrikus (Wise, formerly TransferWise), Harold Primat (investor and former professional racing driver), and the co-founders of Runtastic.</p>
<p>As part of the seed funding, Camilla Dolan of Eka Ventures will join the board alongside the app’s co-founders Kevin Shanahan and Diego López (who previously worked together at language learning app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/11/memrise-raises-15-5m-as-its-ai-based-language-learning-app-passes-35m-users/">Memrise</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paired says its goal for the new funding is to grow its user-base from 5,000+ to 100k over the next 18 months.</p>

<p>Paired fits within that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/self-care-apps-are-booming/">broader trend</a>, albeit with a more explicit nudge to extend the self-care phenomenon to a unit of two romantically connected people.</p>
<p>As it looks for growth, the UK-based startup says it will continue to target the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, which are its main markets at this point. &#8220;We expect the growth to continue to come from here over the next 12 months,&#8221; says Shanahan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building out our product team &#8212; hiring engineers, a product manager, a data scientist &#8212; to begin offering more varied and personalised relationship conversations for our users,&#8221; he goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personalisation is a particular focus as every relationship is different and the app will begin to understand what your interests are, what stage you&#8217;re in, what would be most useful for you to discuss, etc. We&#8217;re also growing our content, working with new experts to cover more relationship topics and marketing the app via influencers, partnerships, and other channels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who are Paired&#8217;s early adopters? Currently, the average user is a straight, early 30s Millennial who&#8217;s been in their current relationship for two-three years, according to Shanahan. (He says around 5% of users are LGBTQ+.)</p>
<p>But he also claims Paired has a wide mix of users, adding: &#8220;We have couples who have been together for 6 months and those who have been together for 10+ years, so it&#8217;s a wide spectrum.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says the split of women and men using the app is &#8220;fairly even&#8221; but avoids specifying exactly how usage splits on gender lines.</p>
<p>The app can be used by only one half of a couple &#8212; for solo relationship support/self-care, if preferred &#8212; but users have the option to pair with their partner to swap answers to relationship questions in order to encourage discussion. And that&#8217;s where Paired can offer the most personalized experience to users, by opening up a dedicated &#8216;relationship&#8217; discussion channel between the couple. (Paired does not obviously cater to open/polyamorous couples &#8212; but presumably could be used as a discussion tool for the primary partners.)</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2156320,2156321,2156322,2156324,2156325,2156327,2156329"]</p>
<p>The idea isn&#8217;t to replace couples therapy, per Shanahan. Rather Paired wants to create a whole new intermediating layer &#8212; based on the notion that communication problems in a relationship can be tackled earlier (and more easily) if you stick a piece of software between you which nudges both halves of the relationship to notice and address potential disconnect.</p>
<p>&#8220;If couples therapy is a dentist for your relationship, then we would be a toothbrush,&#8221; is how Shanahan puts it when asked if the idea is to replace couples therapy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a toothbrush is not a substitute for the dentist, we aren’t trying to replace couples therapy. Our goal is to promote healthy relationship behaviours between couples and believe our audience will eventually grow to become the majority of couples,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>He points to a study Paired commissioned from the Open University and University of Brighton &#8212; which he says showed that couples who used the app over the course of three months saw on average a 36% increase in their &#8220;relationship satisfaction&#8221;. (Albeit quantifying such a subjective measure as a percentile increase may not appeal to every romantic person&#8217;s tastes.)</p>
<p>Shanahan says Paired wants to offer ongoing support, too &#8212; rather than (the opposite scenario) of its users arriving at such a point of mutual understanding they could feel they don&#8217;t never need to take another partner quiz to understand what their life partner is thinking/feeling.</p>
<p>Its philosophy is, no matter how thoughtful you get vis-a-vis your S.O., there&#8217;s always more to learn and thus you always need to keep working on &#8216;relationship care&#8217;. It is of course a very convenient philosophy for a subscription app.</p>
<p>&#8220;You probably wouldn&#8217;t say success when you&#8217;re fit is to stop going to the gym,&#8221; says Shanahan. &#8220;Or when your teeth are healthy to stop brushing your teeth. Similarly we want Paired to be a tool to help keep your relationship in a good place, so success for us is keeping your relationship satisfaction high over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what have the founders learned about their own relationships from using Paired?</p>
<p>Shanahan confirms that he and his partner have been using the app &#8220;a ton (and not just for testing)&#8221;, adding: &#8220;I&#8217;ve personally learnt that there is always more to discover about your partner and it’s a fun journey. Also that discussing issues when they are small is useful so they don&#8217;t become big later down the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diego López, Paired&#8217;s other co-founder and CTO, tells us that the daily questions posed by the app have &#8220;helped my partner and I fight lockdown monotony&#8221;. &#8220;There’s been many occasions where we give the same answer to a question. It’s a great feeling to know that we understand each other and a reminder of the things we have in common,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on Paired&#8217;s seed round in a statement, Camilla Dolan from Eka Ventures, said: “Despite relationship health being such an important and truly global part of our lives there is not currently an accessible and affordable way of supporting it &#8212; <span class="il">Paired</span> has set out to change that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We love Kevin &amp; Diego&#8217;s vision to bring happiness and health to relationships and be the global category leader for relationship management. What really got us excited though was the <span class="il">Paired</span> user stories and the level of change that <span class="il">Paired</span> is already having on their early users.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In another supporting statement, existing investor Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of Wise, added: “Kevin and the <span class="il">Paired</span> team have a vision for improving the relationships of hundreds of millions of couples. Building and strengthening relationships is something we all need help with from time to time, but lots of people feel unsure of where to turn for help. The rapid uptake from paid subscribers since their October launch makes me confident that it can become the global, digital platform for relationships.”</p>
<p>Paired&#8217;s app (available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/id1469609343?ls=1">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getpaired.app">Google Play</a>) is free to download &#8212; but a monthly or yearly subscription is required to access the full range of content and support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://agicap.com/en/">Agicap</a> has raised a new $100 million funding round led by Greenoaks. With today’s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of more than $500 million (€415 million). Agicap is building a service that lets you track your cash flow in real time, build reports and get forecasts.</p>
<p>In addition to Greenoaks, existing investors BlackFin Capital Partners and Partech are also participating in the round. It represents a big jump from last year’s $18 million Series A round.</p>
<p>The basic premise of Agicap is quite simple. Many small companies rely on Microsoft Excel to figure out their cash position every week or every month. Instead of exporting .csv files from your bank accounts, you can connect your bank accounts to Agicap for real-time monitoring. Similarly, Agicap has developed integrations with accounting software and invoicing tools.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When you want to see how you’re doing when it comes to cash, you can connect to your Agicap account just like you’d connect to a web analytics service. Agicap tries to break down how much you’re spending by category and branch. After that, you can run projections and make decisions based on forecasts.</p>
<p>Designed specifically for small and medium companies, Agicap has managed to convince 3,500 companies to use its service. They pay a monthly subscription fee. Clients include Cityscoot, Meero, Merci Handy, Ornikar and Blend Burger.</p>
<p>Agicap is currently live in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. France still generates 50% of the company’s revenue but other markets are growing rapidly.</p>
<p>“This Series B comes at a key moment in our development,” co-founder and CEO Sébastien Beyet said in a statement. “It demonstrates our will to make Agicap the European leader in our market and will allow us to further accelerate our international presence, launching in 10 new countries in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Following today’s funding round, the company has some ambitious expansion plans. The company’s team has already grown from 30 employees to 200 employees over the last 12 months. Now, it plans to build a team of 1,000 employees within the next couple of years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford is increasing its investment in its electric vehicle future to $30 billion by 2025, up from a previous spend of $22 billion by 2023. The company announced the fresh cashflow into its EV and battery development strategy, dubbed Ford+, during an investor day on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it expects 40% of its global vehicle volume to be fully electric by 2030. </span><a href="https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2021/04/01/Q1-Ford-sales-2021.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford sold 6,614 Mustang Mach-Es in the U.S. in Q1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and since it unveiled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">F-150 Lightning last week</a>, the company says it has already amassed 70,000 customer reservations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ford+ plan reveals the new path automakers will have to take if they want to keep up with an EV future. Historically, China, Japan and Korea have owned much of the world’s battery manufacturing, but as major OEMs begin building electric cars, the demand is far outstripping supply, forcing car manufacturers to invest their own resources into development. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/gms-second-2-3b-battery-plant-with-lg-chem-to-open-in-late-2023/">General Motors is building a battery factory with LG in Ohio</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/ford-bmw-lead-solid-powers-130m-series-b-round/">BMW joined Ford to invest in solid state battery startup Solid Power</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This investment “underscores our belief that production-feasible solid state batteries are within reach in this decade,” said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s chief product platform and operations officer, during the investor day. “Solid Power’s sulphide-based solid electrolyte and silicon-based anode chemistry delivers impressive battery improvements in performance, including increased range, lower cost, more vehicle interior space and better value and greater safety for our customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solid state battery manufacturing process doesn’t differ too much from the existing lithium ion battery process, so Ford will be able to reuse about 70% of its manufacturing lines and capital investment, according to Thai-Tang. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our ultimate goal is to deliver a holistic ecosystem including services that should allow us to achieve higher profitability over time with BEVs than we do today with ICE vehicles,” said Thai-Tang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ion Boost +’s unique cell pouch format is not only ideal for powering Ford’s larger vehicles, but it could also help the company reduce battery costs 40% by mid-decade, the company says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cell chemistry, coupled with Ford&#8217;s proprietary battery control algorithm featuring high accuracy sensing technology, delivers higher efficiency and range for customers,” said Thai-Tang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For commercial vehicles, Ford is working on a battery cell made with lithium ion phosphate chemistry, which it’s calling the Ion Boost Pro, which it says is cheaper and better for duty cycles that require less range.</span></p>
