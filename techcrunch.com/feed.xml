										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3"><a href="https://pry.co/">Pry Financials</a> wants to make startup finances approachable for its entire team, not just the people in charge of its accounting spreadsheets. The Y Combinator alum announced today it has raised $4.2 million from Global Founders Capital, Pioneer Fund, NOMO VC, Liquid2 and Hyphen Capital.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Launched in March, Pry now has more than 200 customers and claims it has grown 35% month-over-month since YC’s Demo Day. It was founded by Alex Sailer, Tiffany Wong, Hayden Jensen and Andy Su.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Before starting Pry, Su was co-founder of InDinero, another YC alum that started as a “Mint for small businesses” before<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/01/jessica-mahindinero"> pivoting to a full-service accounting company</a>. InDinero launched while he was still a student at U.C. Berkeley and Su eventually became responsible for its financial planning.</p>

<p class="p3">He told TechCrunch that most startups can’t afford accounting software like Workday Adaptive Planning. Instead, they sometimes work with outsourced CFO services, but mostly rely on spreadsheets for everything: three-way forecasts, predicting runway, hiring and contractor budgets and investor updates.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“I was the chief technical officer and over the years, I also took on the finance function, so it was kind of a dual CTO/CFO role. This was 2010 through 2020 and as technology grew, the engineering and product teams got all sorts of new tools every six months or so, whereas the finance team was just stuck in Excel,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Started as a side project was Su was still at InDinero, Pry starts at just $50 a month and replaces those spreadsheets with easy-to-understand dashboards for accounting, financial planning and scenario modeling. The dashboards connect to Quickbook, Xero or bank accounts, so numbers are continuously updated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">Pry&#8217;s clients typically start using it after they raise seed funding, because “for most first-time founders, that’s the most amount of money you have ever received, so you need to spend more time managing it and reviewing it every month. And you’re spending a lot of time on payroll each month,” Su said. Second-time founders, meanwhile, sign up for Pry because they are sick of Excel spreadsheets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FreshBooks reaches $1B+ valuation with $130.75M for its SMB-focused accounting platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/freshbooks-secures-130-75m/embed/#?secret=xEDQoq01lN" data-secret="xEDQoq01lN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p3">“Reviewing a spreadsheet is mind-numbingly hard,” said Su. “If you see a number that’s off, you get this weird formula if you didn’t do it yourself. Then you basically have to write a long email to the financial analyst who wrote it and hope that they get back to you before closing time.” For founders who need to update lenders or investors every month, this means a lot of work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Pry makes the process more efficient by turning three-way reports—combinations of balance sheets, profit and loss statements and cashflow—into Financial Report dashboards, and then adding features like hiring plans, financial modeling and scenario planning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">The scenario planning feature serves as a sandbox, giving startup teams and their investors a way to predict how different situations will impact finances: for example, how much runway they have if they raise a certain amount of funding or adjust product pricing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192032" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192032" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2192032" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pry_financials-fundraising-dashboard-1.jpg" alt="Fundraising dashboards created with Pry Financials" width="1024" height="589" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pry_financials-fundraising-dashboard-1.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pry_financials-fundraising-dashboard-1.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pry_financials-fundraising-dashboard-1.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pry_financials-fundraising-dashboard-1.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pry_financials-fundraising-dashboard-1.jpg?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pry_financials-fundraising-dashboard-1.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192032" class="wp-caption-text">Fundraising dashboards created with Pry Financials</p></div></p>
<p class="p3">“We’re improving upon and trying to make decisions about the company in a collaborative way. The analogy we have is git branching, where you have your main plan, and want to try something like a new revenue model or acquiring a business, but don’t want to mess with your current strategy,” said Su. “What you can do is create a completely new branch with, say, a new pricing strategy. You can make all the changes you want and then switch back to your old branch without worrying about overriding or conflicting with it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Those speculative branches are also continuously updated with the company’s most recent bank account and payroll information, so founders don’t need to recreate them from scratch if they want to revisit a potential scenario later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Pry plans to build more complex predictive tools and also integrate industry standards, like statistic and benchmarks, into templates to help founders understand what targets they should set.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Since Pry is easier to manage than a set of Excel spreadsheets, Su said it&#8217;s helped startups spot important things. For example, one founder was able to find a way to save $15,000 by catching a tax issue. Pry also helps everyone at a startup understand its finances’ even if they haven’t worked with accounting spreadsheets before. The platform will add roles and permissions soon, so founders can give or restrict access to different people, like leaders of specific departments.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Su said Pry does not compete with the accounting services many startups rely on until they can hire a head of finance, but makes it easier for startups to collaborate with them since they can share their dashboards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Usually early on, you can outsource to a CFO firm. That’s the norm in the business and it works pretty well for most companies. You get a part-time CFO to work really hard for a month and get your fundraising structure done,” said Su, adding “we fit into that ecosystem well.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Clarisse Beurrier was getting her education in Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, she already knew she wanted to make a difference; hence her participation in Effective Altruism Cambridge, an organization dedicated to helping smart and capable people target their philanthropic urges at the problems that will have the biggest actual impact on the world. She&#8217;s now a co-founder at Animal Alternative Technologies, a startup aiming to expedite the commercialization of cultured — aka &#8216;lab-grown&#8217; — meat.</p>
<p>Clarisse joined us for this week&#8217;s episode of <a href="https://pod.link/found">Found</a>, our interview podcast where we speak to a different founder every week. We talk about what Clarisse learned about the cultured meat and animal protein alternative industry from her work experience at a couple of startups, including HigherSteaks, and how that dovetailed with the work she was doing at school to help her identify a crucial gap between science and industry. We get into everything from convincing big, entrenched industry heavyweights to embrace change, and the challenges of being a firs-time founder right out of school.</p>
<p>We loved our time chatting with Clarisse, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we’d love if you can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian regulators have given Taiwan Innovative Space, a five-year-old launch company that goes by <a href="http://www.tispace.com/">Tispace</a>, the green light to conduct a commercial launch at a newly licensed facility in southern Australia later this year.</p>
<p>Tispace will conduct a test flight of its two-stage, suborbital rocket Hapith I from the Whalers Way Orbital Launch Complex in Southern Australia. The flight will be used to validate the vehicle’s propulsion, guidance, telemetry, and structure systems, Tispace said in a news release.The launch facility, operated by space infrastructure company Southern Launch, received its license from the country’s industry ministry in March.</p>
<p>The news is potentially significant for both Australia and Taiwan’s burgeoning space industries, which have lagged behind other nations&#8217;. Australia only established a domestic space agency in 2018, and interest in how the country can get in on the new space economy has only grown since. The newly licensed launch facility will initially support a test launch campaign for up to three suborbital rockets, in order to collect data on the possible environmental impacts of the site.</p>
<p>“This [launch permit approval] is an important outcome in establishing Australia’s commercial launch capability and demonstrating what our country can offer to the international space sector,” Australia’s Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Christian Porter, said in a statement. “Space is a significant global growth market that will support Australia’s economic future through big investment, new technologies and job growth across multiple industries.”</p>
<p>Taiwan has also been slow to develop a home-grown space industry, though the country took a major step forward when Taiwanese legislators passed the Space Development Law in May to spur the development of a domestic space program. But while the country has a handful of satellites in orbit – most recently the YUSAT and IDEASSat CubeSats, which were transported into orbit on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in January – it has yet to launch a rocket or spacecraft from its soil.</p>
<p>Hapith I is Taiwan’s first domestically manufactured rocket, and Tispace its first commercial space launch company. The company had planned to test the Hapith vehicle from a launch site in Taiwan, but the site was scrapped over legal issues concerning the location. In addition to launch, Tispace may start conducting even more of its operations abroad: according to an Australian press release, it’s also considering “bringing manufacturing of complete rocket systems” to the land down under.</p>

<p>Live-action adaptations of anime haven&#8217;t typically been well-received (here&#8217;s looking at you, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-08-ghost-in-the-shell-cyberpunk.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Ghost in the Shell</ins></em></a>). There&#8217;s pressure on Netflix to get this take on <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> right, but things are looking promising. The core cast looks great in the first batch of images, while some key creatives from the 1998 anime are involved.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Getting children to school safely and reliably is a challenge as old as public education itself. But rarely have any entrepreneurs tackled the problem of updating and optimizing one of the nation&#8217;s largest legacy transit systems, now nearly a century old. It&#8217;s still common to find people at U.S. student transportation hubs speaking into walkie-talkies and wrangling clipboards as they sort passengers into gas-guzzling yellow buses.</p>
<p>Ritu Narayan was working as a product executive at eBay when her two children began attending school. Finding safe and reliable options for getting them to campus was sometimes so difficult that anytime those options would fall out, she would be on the verge of leaving her job.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;We had the minimum viable product, which we expanded upon, built the entire platform, and we kept on going to better places with our solutions.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that her mother in India had set aside a career to raise Narayan and her three siblings, she founded Zūm in 2016 with brothers Abhishek and Vivek Garg to optimize routes, create transparency and make school commutes greener; since then, Zūm has operated in several California districts (including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/zum-wins-150m-from-san-francisco-schools-to-modernize-and-electrify-student-transport/">San Francisco</a>), as well as in Seattle, Chicago and Dallas. In Oakland, Zūm has optimized routes to reduce the previous bus requirement by 29 percent, with the balance being serviced by midsized vehicles.</p>
<p>Zūm also plans to have a fleet of 10,000 electric school buses by 2025 and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/child-transpo-startup-zum-aims-to-create-1-gigawatt-of-energy-with-electric-school-buses/">partnering with AutoGrid</a> to transform that fleet into a virtual power plant with the potential capacity to route 1 GW of energy back to the grid.</p>
<p>To get a deeper look into the startup&#8217;s plans and hear what Narayan has learned from its journey so far, we discussed the pandemic&#8217;s impacts on Zūm&#8217;s development, where she thinks the company will be a year from now, and how she convinced investors to back a business model that embraces accessibility and equity.</p>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited for clarity and length.)</em></p>
<p><b>How did COVID-19 affect your business? What percentage of your business is back now?</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny, because we used to say that student transportation is a recession-proof business, and no matter what, kids are still going to go to school, but the pandemic was the first time in probably the last 100 years when kids across the globe did not go to school. It was an interesting time for us, because overnight, all the rides were closed and we had to focus on what was needed immediately to support our districts and students.</p>
<p>We realized that the school is such an important physical infrastructure that&#8217;s not just for education, but students get meals there as well as physical and emotional help. So we helped the school districts with reverse logistics, taking the meals or laptops from the school districts and delivering them to homes, because our software could handle that kind of thing. That was just an interim to make sure the communities settled. Starting last year, rides started coming back around 30%, and this year starting in April, it has been 100% back in the business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Silicon Valley was once one of the most productive regions in the country for the defense industry, churning out chips and technologies that helped the United States overtake the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Since then, the region has been known far less for silicon and defense than for the consumer internet products of Google, Facebook and Netflix.</p>
<p>A small number of startups though are attempting to revitalize that important government-industry nexus as the rise of China pushes more defense planners in Washington to double down on America’s technical edge. <a href="https://www.vannevarlabs.com">Vannevar Labs</a> is one of this new crop, and it has hit some new milestones in its quest to displace traditional defense contractors with Silicon Valley entrepreneurial acumen.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/vannevar-labs-comes-out-of-stealth-to-bring-best-in-class-ai-tech-to-national-security-agencies/">I last chatted with the company just as it was debuting in late 2019</a>, having raised a $4.5 million seed. The company has been quiet and heads down the past two years as it developed a product and traction within the defense establishment. Now it’s ready to reveal a bit more of what all that work has culminated in.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Vannevar Labs comes out of stealth to bring best-in-class AI tech to national security agencies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/vannevar-labs-comes-out-of-stealth-to-bring-best-in-class-ai-tech-to-national-security-agencies/embed/#?secret=jcXDFkYEsh" data-secret="jcXDFkYEsh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>First, the company officially launched its Vannevar Decrypt product in January of this year. It’s focused on foreign language natural language processing, organizing overseas data and resources that are collected by the intelligence community and then immediately translating and interpreting those documents for foreign policy decision-makers. CEO and co-founder Brett Granberg said that the product “went from one deployment to a dozen adoptions.”</p>
<p>Second, the company raised a $12 million Series A investment in May from Costanoa Ventures and Point72 with General Catalyst participating. Costanoa and GC co-led the startup’s seed round.</p>
<p>Finally, the company has been on a hiring spree. The team has grown into a crew of 20 employees, and the firm last week brought on Scott Sanders to lead business development. Sanders was one of the earliest employees at Anduril, and had spent several years at the company. Vannevar also added John Doyle, a long-time Palantir employee who was head of its national security business, onto its board according to Granberg. Today, the team is equally split between national security folks and technologists, and he says that the team is set to double this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>With a few years of hindsight, Granberg says that he has refined what he considers the best model for defense tech startups to break into the hardscrabble market at the Pentagon and across Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>First, there needs to be incredible focus on getting access to actual end users and learning their work. The functions that defense and intelligence personnel perform are completely different from operations in the commercial economy, and trying to translate what works at a large corporation into defense is a fool’s errand. “You need to have both the DNA of understanding new technology and the DNA of deeply understanding a lot of different use cases within DoD,” Granberg said, referencing the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>That’s directly informed how Decrypt has developed over time. “We started focusing on the counter-terrorism space, and as the government moved away from counter-terrorism, we started moving to the foreign actors that were important,” he said. “Once we have our first couple of deployments, we are able to iterate very, very quickly.”</p>
<p>He also strongly eschews a popular view in defense procurement circles that there are “dual-use” technologies that can be used equally well in commercial and defense applications. “Some of the most important mission problems where the government spends the most money and has the most interest,” he explained, are also contexts where commercial off-the-shelf products (dubbed COTS in the industry parlance) are least useful. He says startups targeting defense simply cannot split their bandwidth by also trying to learn commercial use cases.</p>
<p>In fact, he went so far to predict that “you are going to see a lot of companies that have raised a lot of money that will fizzle out in the coming years” because they just can’t nail the dual-use model well.</p>
<p>Second, he argues that defense tech startups need to move beyond the model that each company should work on one platform, and instead move to an organizational model where a company offers multiple products to reach scale. Each product has the potential to reach “a couple of hundred million in revenue” according to Granberg, but it is hard to expand a company’s size if it doesn’t parallelize product development.</p>
<p>To that end, Granberg said that he pushes Vannevar Labs to always be exploring new product lines for growth. “Decrypt is our first product [but]10% of our energy is in new product efforts,” he said. “I can imagine when we are three to four years down the line… it might be 9-10 products.” He said that the one platform approach might have worked for Palantir, which ironically, is the major winner in the defense tech space the last few years. But newer companies like Anduril and Shield AI have been designed around product line expansion.</p>
<p>Finally, noting those other companies, Granberg believes there is something of a collective benefit as each startup makes headway in the defense sector. “There is this theory in our space that we don’t view ourselves as competitors — if one of us does well, we all do well,” he said. Given the varied mission requirements of different agencies and the absolute massive scale of budgets in this field, startups actually have a lot of independent terrain to explore, even if they come up against the big legacy defense contractors on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As for Vannevar Labs, its next goal is to turn its Decrypt product into a program of record, which would guarantee it a certain level of sales and revenue for potentially years into the future. That’s a huge bar to leap, but would be a turning point in the company’s long-term trajectory.</p>

<p>In the meantime, check out these agenda highlights:</p>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Survival of the Fittest: Investing in Today’s SaaS Market<br />
</strong></span>with Casey Aylward (Costanoa Ventures), Kobie Fuller (Upfront) and Sarah Guo (Greylock)</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The venture capital world is faster and more competitive than ever. For investors hoping to get into the hottest SaaS deal, things are even crazier. With more nontraditional money pouring into the sector, remote dealmaking now the norm and an increasingly global market for software startups, venture capitalists are being forced to shake up their own operations &#8212; and expectations. TechCrunch sits down with three leading investors to discuss how they are fighting for allocation in hot deals, what they’ve changed in their own processes, and what today’s best founders are demanding.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Data, Data Everywhere<br />
</strong></span>with Ali Ghodsi (Databricks)</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As companies struggle to manage and share increasingly large amounts of data, it&#8217;s no wonder that Databricks, whose primary product is a data lake, was valued at a whopping $28 billion for its most recent funding round. We&#8217;re going to talk to CEO Ali Ghodsi about why his startup is so hot, and what comes next.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient">SaaS Security, Today and Tomorrow</span><br />
with Edna Conway (Microsoft), Olivia Rose (Amplitude)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enterprises face a constant stream of threats, from nation states to cybercriminals and corporate insiders. After a year where billions worked from home and the cloud reigned supreme, startups and corporations alike can&#8217;t afford to stay off the security pulse. Find out what SaaS startups need to know about security now, and in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now</strong></span><br />
with Daniel Dines (UiPath), Laela Sturdy (CapitalG) and Dave Wright (ServiceNow)</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing we learned during the pandemic is the importance of automation, and that&#8217;s only likely to be more pronounced as we move forward. We&#8217;ll be talking to UiPath CEO Daniel Dines, Laela Sturdy, an investor at CapitalG and Dave Wright from ServiceNow about why this is automation&#8217;s moment.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>Was the Pandemic Cloud Productivity&#8217;s Spark</strong></span><br />
with Javier Soltero (Google)</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">One big aspect of SaaS is productivity apps like Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Drive. We&#8217;ll talk with executive Javier Soltero about the role Google Workspace plays in the Google cloud strategy.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>The Future Is Wide Open</strong><br />
</span>with Abby Kearns (Puppet), Aghi Marietti (Kong) and Jason Warner (Redpoint)</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many startups today have an open-source component, and it&#8217;s no wonder. It builds an audience and helps drive sales. We&#8217;ll talk with Abby Kearns from Puppet, Augusto “Aghi” Marietti from Kong and Jason Warner, an investor at Redpoint, about why open source is such a popular way to build a business.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>How Microsoft Shifted from On-Prem to the Cloud</strong></span><br />
with Jared Spataro (Microsoft)</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jared Spataro has been with Microsoft for over 15 years and he was a part of the shift from strictly on-prem software to that which is dominated by the cloud. Today he runs one of the most successful SaaS products out there, and we&#8217;ll talk to him about how Microsoft made that shift and what it&#8217;s meant to the company.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>How Startups are Turning Data into Software Gold</strong></span><br />
with Jenn Knight (Agentsync), Barr Moses (Monte Carlo) and Dan Wright (DataRobot)</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The era of big data is behind us. Today’s leading SaaS startups are working </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data, instead of merely fighting to help customers collect information. We’ve collected three leaders from three data-focused startups that are forging new markets to get their insight on how today’s SaaS companies are leveraging data to build new companies, attack new problems and, of course, scale like mad.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>What Happens After Your Startup Is Acquired</strong></span><br />
with Jyoti Bansal (Harness), Nick Mehta (GainSight) a<strong>nd Jewel Burkes Solomon (Partpic)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ll speak to three founders about the emotional upheaval of being acquired and what happens after the check clears and the sale closes. Our panel includes Jyoti Bansal who founded AppDynamics, Jewel Burkes Solomon, who founded Partpic and Nick Mehta from GainSight.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="gradient-text gradient-text--green-gradient"><strong>How Confluent Rode the Open Source Wave to IPO</strong></span><br />
with Jay Kreps (Confluent)</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confluent, the streaming platform built on top of Apache Kafka, was born out of a project at LinkedIn, and rode that from startup to IPO. We&#8217;ll speak to co-founder and CEO Jay Kreps to learn about what that journey was like.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll have more sessions and names shortly, so stay tuned. But get excited in the meantime, we certainly are.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://givz.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Givz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has developed an API-powered platform that gives brands a way to convert discounts into donations, has raised $3 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eniac and Accomplice co-led the financing for the New York-based startup. Additional investors include Supernode Ventures, Claude Wasserstein of Fine Day, Phoenix Club and Dylan Whitman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Givz was founded in 2017 to make charitable giving more accessible and convenient for the masses. In March 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the company pivoted from B2C to B2B and used the technology rails it had built to create the e-commerce marketing platform that Givz is today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company aims to drive “full-price purchasing behavior” by giving consumers the ability to convert the money they would be saving if getting a discount, and donating it to their favorite charities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the funding, Givz had been working with more than 80 enterprise, mid-market and SMB retail and e-commerce clients such as H&amp;M, Tom Brady’s TB12, Seedlip and Terez, and accumulated more than 40,000 individual users. Since the shift last year, the company has helped drive more than $1 million to 1,100 charities, according to CEO and founder Andrew Forman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It just launched on Shopify, which Forman says will give the startup access to the 1.7 million retailers that use Shopify as their e-commerce platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Givz operates under the premise that “donation-driven marketing” consistently outperforms discounts and costs less, “making it an attractive addition&#8221; to corporate marketing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are creating a new marketing category and generating the largest sustainable charitable giving platform in the process,” he told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of a company using Givz can be found in Tervis, which offered customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For every $50 you spend, you’ll receive $15 to give to the charity of your choice.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They used Givz technology to allow consumers to choose the charity of their choice and make a turnkey disbursement to hundreds of charities,” Forman explained. “They saw a 20% lift in website conversion and a 17% increase in average order value as a result of this offer.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192368" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192368" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192368 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?w=570" alt="" width="570" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg 1144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?resize=126,150 126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?resize=252,300 252w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?resize=768,916 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?resize=570,680 570w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Givz.jpg?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192368" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Givz</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Givz has eight employees with plans to more than double that number over the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use the new capital toward that hiring, and to do some marketing of its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also want to explore the full potential around the consumer behavior data we collect,” Forman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short term, Givz is focused on “Shopify growth” with direct to consumer brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we have successful use cases and huge potential with enterprise retailers and financial institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Forman told TechCrunch. “In the future, we have our sights set on restaurants, the gaming industry and global expansion. I believe that using personalized donations to incentivize consumer behavior has endless application across industries, verticals and continents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eniac partner Vic Singh said that there’s been a trend of brands experimenting with different ways to target the socially conscious consumer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe Givz&#8217;s donation-driven marketing platform offers brands the best way to attract the socially conscious consumer while elevating their brand, moving more inventory and driving increased order value rather than simplistic traditional discounting,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accomplice’s TJ Mahony said that both he and Singh believed SMS would emerge as a new marketing category, which led to early investments in Attentive and Postscript, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We both saw a similar opportunity with Givz,” he wrote via e-mail. “Discounting is a well worn marketing muscle, but it&#8217;s detrimental to the brand, margins and customer expectations. We believe continuous impact marketing becomes the alternative to discounting and marketers will begin to build teams and budget around thoughtful and persistent giving strategies.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deena Shakir is a partner at Lux Capital, where she looks to invest in technologies that are streamlining analog industries while also improving lives and livelihoods. Among the companies she has backed, for example, are <a href="https://www.shiru.com/">Shiru</a>, which is leveraging computational design to create enhanced proteins to help feed the world; and <a href="https://www.allstripes.com/">AllStripes</a>, which aggregates and analyzes medical records, then sells the de-identified data to pharma companies to help them develop medicines.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a surprise that Shakir is focused on empowering people. Shakir&#8217;s father is a psychiatrist and as she <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/lux-capitals-deena-shakir-sees-space-and-frontier-tech-going-mainstream-right-now/">once told us</a>, &#8220;for a hot minute, I thought I was going to be a doctor myself.&#8221; Instead, after attending Harvard, then Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service, she wound up working for the State Department during the Obama administration, then headed to Google. She would stay for the next seven years, spending the last of them with GV, Google’s venture unit. There, her work revolved in part around some of the alternative protein companies in GV&#8217;s portfolio. Then, in 2019, she was poached by Lux.</p>
<p>Indeed, while Shakir might have once imagined working with people on an individual basis, she has become an increasingly sought-after investor in startup teams, which is why we couldn&#8217;t be more excited that she&#8217;s able to join us this year for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>. Specifically, we&#8217;re thrilled that Shakir will be judging our Startup Battlefield competition, the centerpiece of Disrupt every year and oftentimes a life-changing event for the winning team &#8212; and often runners-up, too. Consider that past winners include Vurb, Dropbox, Mint and Yammer, while runner-up Cloudflare currently boasts a market cap of $38 billion.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s because we take the competition &#8212; and our record to date &#8212; so seriously that we&#8217;re exceedingly thankful to savvy investors like Shakir, who ask the right questions, and make the tough decisions when it comes time to decide which teams to move along.</p>
<p>Want to watch and judge from home? With our entirely virtual event this year, you&#8217;re more than welcome to join us from the comfort of your home or office (and let us know what you think of the startups within the many networking forums you&#8217;ll find).</p>
<p>To watch this year&#8217;s 20+ startups compete for $100,000 &#8212; and to interact with more than 100 hours of content and thousands of enthusiastic startup fans &#8212; make sure to book your pass to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TC Disrupt, happening September 21-23</a> &#8212; all for less than $100.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine">granted full approval</a> to Pfizer-BioNTech&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine, making it the first vaccine to achieve that status. The mRNA-based vaccine has been available since late last year through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), and will continue to be offered under that designation for those aged 12 to 15 until that separate approval process goes through, but the U.S. drug regulator now recognizes the Pfizer vaccine as fully approved and certified for adults 16 and up.</p>
<p>Part of receiving the approval means that Pfizer and BioNTech can now officially market their vaccine in the U.S., and the FDA revealed it&#8217;ll be offered under the trade dress &#8220;Comirnarty,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t strike me as particularly catchy but at least it&#8217;s less of a mouthful than &#8220;the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.&#8221; FDA approval also means that the vaccine has met all of the administration&#8217;s standards for safety and efficacy, including preclinical and clinical trial data, as well as information about its manufacture, and data gathered from its use during the EUA period.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s hope that this new full authorization will encourage fence-sitters who have offered up &#8220;I&#8217;ll wait until it&#8217;s fully approved&#8221; as an excuse for not yet having gotten the vaccine despite its availability. At the very least, it&#8217;s going to be a lot harder for those hesitating to justify their unreasonable and irresponsible stance in the face of the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>Comirnarty got flagged for &#8220;Priority Review&#8221; by the FDA, which essentially means that the administration devoted its full attention to the process in order to expedite it. No word yet on a timeline for Moderna&#8217;s approval, but it&#8217;s also in the priority review queue.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be talking to BioNTech CEO and co-founder Uğur Şahin at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ursheetpost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=ugursahinpost&amp;display=TRUE">TC Disrupt 2021</a> this year, so be sure to check out that virtual event coming up September 21-23.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The companies we're examining cover auto insurance (Root, MetroMile), home and rental insurance (Hippo, Lemonade), and health insurance (Oscar Health). All are taking a whacking by the market. Why?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve spent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/24/should-we-be-worried-about-insurtech-valuations/">quite a lot of time</a> of late wondering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/a-lot-of-cash-and-little-love-an-insurtech-story/?tpcc=ECTW2020">just what the heck</a> is up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/what-happens-when-wall-street-falls-out-of-love-with-your-sector/">the valuations of insurtech startups that went public</a> in the last year. Keep in mind that we&#8217;re discussing neoinsurance providers like MetroMile and Hippo, not insurtech marketplaces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/insurify-raises-23m-series-a-to-add-new-coverage-varietals-boost-its-marketing-efforts/">like Insurify</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/the-zebra-reaches-100m-run-rate-turns-profitable-as-insurtech-booms/">or Zebra</a>.</p>
<p>There was a stream of insurtech exits in 2020 and early 2021. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/high-flying-ipos-for-lemonade-and-accolade-may-encourage-other-unicorns-to-go-public/">Lemonade&#8217;s firecracker IPO</a>, MetroMile and Hippo and Root also went public. Since those debuts, we&#8217;ve seen their valuations erode significantly.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But Oscar Health got somewhat lost in our larger analysis of the space. An investor pointed out to The Exchange this weekend that we were a bit early in wondering just what investors were thinking when Oscar was going public &#8212; its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/oscar-healths-initial-ipo-price-is-so-high-it-makes-me-want-to-swear/">IPO price range felt incredibly high, and we said so</a>. Then, Oscar Health priced above that $32 to $34 per share interval, kicking off its life <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/oscar-health-prices-ipo-at-39-and-secures-a-9-5b-valuation/">worth $39 per share</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s it&#8217;s worth $13.58 per share.</p>
<p>We could call it another data point in our larger analysis, but it&#8217;s a bit more than that as Oscar Health expands the list of insurance <em>types</em> that startups tackled, scaled, took public and then saw fall out of investor favor. The companies that we are examining cover a number of industries, from auto insurance (Root, MetroMile), to home and rental insurance (Hippo, Lemonade), and, thanks to Oscar Health, health insurance as well. All are taking a whacking by the market.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em> Happily, I think I&#8217;ve figured it out. More precisely, a CEO of a neoinsurance company in a different niche talked The Exchange through one particular hypothesis that makes rather good sense.</p>
<h2>Show me the <del>money</del> metrics</h2>
<p>Last week, I chatted with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnswigart/">Pie Insurance co-founder CEO John Swigart</a>. Pie sells SMB-focused insurance, with a focus on workers&#8217; comp coverage. In Swigart&#8217;s view, small businesses have historically been overcharged and underserved for insurance. With a bit of tech, his company can offer coverage to smaller companies than many traditional insurance providers found attractive, and at better price points to boot.</p>
<p>Pie raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/pie-insurance-raises-118m/">a $118 million Series C</a> in March, with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pie-insurance/company_financials">Crunchbase tallying $306 million</a> in external capital for the company thus far. We&#8217;ll talk more about Pie at a later date.</p>
<p>What matters for our needs this morning is what Swigart said when I asked him what in the flying fuck was going on with public insurtech share prices. Given that he is building a related company, I was hoping that he would be both up to speed and have a take. He did.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s show was good fun to put together. Here&#8217;s what we got to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global stocks are up to kick off the week. It&#8217;s a great way to start Monday, frankly.</li>
<li>Thinking broadly, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/china-roundup-bytedance-amazon/">latest regulatory news</a> from China regarding ByteDance is not super bullish for the nation&#8217;s tech industry. And what the <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/big-tech-thought-it-had-a-billion-users-in-the-bag-now-its">Indian government is doing to its own technology industry is not encouraging</a>. But all of that <em>and</em> tension between the two countries is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/tencent-in-talks-to-lead-funding-in-indias-pocket-fm/">not stopping deals</a>. You can&#8217;t stop deals!</li>
<li>Facebook <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/21/facebook-coronavirus-vaccine/">bowed to pressure</a>, and released a content report that it had previously shelved.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/indias-zetwerk-valued-at-1-33-billion-in-new-funding/">Zetwerk raised a $150 million Series E.</a> The Indian startup scene is trucking right along, perhaps acting a bit as if its government wasn&#8217;t increasingly authoritarian.</li>
<li>Shelf.io raised a $52.5 million Series B in what we&#8217;re somewhat considering a classic Tiger-led deal.</li>
<li>And the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virgin-orbit-to-go-public-via-3-2b-spac-deal/">SPAC boom is not over yet</a>, with yet another Virgin space company headed for the public markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Woo! And that&#8217;s the start to the week. Hugs from here, and we&#8217;ll chat you on Wednesday!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the sort of deal that we expect to see Tiger in -- an outsized investment compared to prior rounds into a high-growth company that has lots of market room. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Covering public companies can be a bit of a drag. They grow some modest amount each year, and their constituent analysts pester them with questions about gross margin expansion and sales rep efficiency. It can be a little dull. Then there are startups, which grow much more quickly &#8212; and are more fun to talk about.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the case with <a href="https://shelf.io/">Shelf.io</a>. The company announced an impressive set of metrics this morning, including that from July 2020 to July 2021, it grew its annual recurring revenue (ARR) 4x. Shelf also disclosed that it secured a $52.5 million Series B led by Tiger Global and Insight Partners.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s quick growth for a post-Series A startup. Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shelf-io">reckons</a> that the company raised $8.2 million before its Series B, while <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> pegs the number at $6.5 million. Regardless, the company was efficiently expanding from a limited capital base before its latest fundraising event.</p>
<p>What does the company&#8217;s software do? Shelf plugs into a company&#8217;s information systems, learns from the data and then helps employees respond to queries without forcing them to execute searches or otherwise hunt for information.</p>
<p>The company is starting with customer service as its target vertical. According to Shelf CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sedarius-tekara-perrotta-14658235">Sedarius Perrotta</a>, Shelf can absorb information from, say, Salesforce, SharePoint, legacy knowledge management platforms and Zendesk. Then, after training models and staff, the company&#8217;s software can begin to provide support staff with answers to customer questions as they talk to customers in real time.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s tech can also power responses to customer queries not aimed at a human agent and provide a searchable database of company knowledge to help workers more quickly solve customer issues.</p>
<p>Per Perrotta, Shelf is targeting the sales market next, with others to follow. How might Shelf fit into sales? According to the company, its software may be able to offer staff already written proposals for similar-seeming deals and other related content. The gist is that at companies that have lots of workers doing similar tasks &#8212; clicking around in Salesforce, or answering support queries, say &#8212; Shelf can learn from the activity and get smarter in helping employees with their tasks. I presume that the software&#8217;s learning ability will improve over time, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shelf, around 100 people today, hopes to double in size by the end of the year, and then double again next year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Y6rxoVm7kq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/the-tortoise-and-the-hare-story-is-playing-out-right-now-in-vc/">&#8216;The tortoise and the hare&#8217; story is playing out right now in VC</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;The tortoise and the hare&#8217; story is playing out right now in VC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/the-tortoise-and-the-hare-story-is-playing-out-right-now-in-vc/embed/#?secret=Y6rxoVm7kq" data-secret="Y6rxoVm7kq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That&#8217;s where the new capital comes in. Hiring folks in the worlds of machine learning and data science is very expensive. And because the company wants to scale those hires quickly, it will need a large bank balance to lean on.</p>
<p>Quick ARR growth was not the only reason Shelf was able to secure such an outsized Series B, at least when compared to how much capital it had raised before. Per Perrotta, Shelf has 130% net dollar retention and no churn to report, meaning its customers are both sticky and expand organically.</p>
<p>While Shelf is interesting today and has certainly found niches it can sell into in its current form, I am more curious about how far the company can take its machine learning system, called MerlinAI. If its tech can get sufficiently smart, its ability to prompt and help employees could reduce onboarding time and the overall cost of employee training. That would be a huge market.</p>
<p>This is the sort of deal that we expect to see Tiger in &#8212; an outsized investment (compared to prior rounds) into a high-growth company that has lots of market room. Whatever price Tiger just paid for the company&#8217;s stock, a few years of continued growth should de-risk the investment. By our read, Tiger is really just the market-leading bull on software market growth in the long term. Shelf fits into that thesis neatly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal will now allow users outside the U.S. to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency for the first time. The company announced today the launch of <a href="http://www.paypal.com/uk/crypto">a new service</a> that will allow customers in the U.K. to select between four types of cryptocurrencies &#8212; including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash &#8212; which can be purchased using a connected bank account or debit card.</p>
<p>The company first rolled out support for cryptocurrency in the U.S. last fall, in partnership with <a href="https://www.paxos.com/">Paxos Trust Company</a>. That service reached all U.S. customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">as of mid-November.</a> PayPal-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">Venmo also added support</a> for cryptocurrency last spring.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Venmo adds support for buying, holding and selling cryptocurrencies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/embed/#?secret=owZUK8FsRG" data-secret="owZUK8FsRG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>U.K. customers who want to purchase cryptocurrency can now do so via the PayPal website or mobile app, where they can choose from pre-determined purchase amounts or enter another amount of their own choosing. PayPal says users will be able to start buying as little as £1 of cryptocurrency, if they choose. There are, however, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees?locale.x=en_GB">transaction fees</a> and currency conversion fees when buying and selling <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees?locale.x=en_GB">cryptocurrency</a>, the company notes. These vary based on the amount of cryptocurrency being bought or sold.</p>
<p>The new service itself is very much like PayPal&#8217;s U.S. offering, with one notable exception. PayPal told us it&#8217;s tailoring the transaction limits for its U.K. customers. At launch, the maximum amount for any single crypto purchase is £15,000. The maximum amount for purchases over a 12-month period is £35,000. In the U.S., the company had initially launched the service with a $20,000 weekly purchase limit. But it <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/paypal-increases-crypto-purchase-limits-to-100k">upped that to $100,000 in July</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/15/paypal-ups-weekly-crypto-purchase-limit-fivefold-to-100000-.html">dropped its annual purchase limit</a>.</p>
<p>The company also told TechCrunch the U.K. made sense as the first international expansion for its cryptocurrency service because it&#8217;s a fintech hub, as well as PayPal&#8217;s second-largest market globally, where it has a sizable base of consumer customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that we&#8217;re going to be helping the cryptocurrency ecosystem develop further in the U.K. In the U.S., we knew there was high demand for this service. Yet we were surprised to see the level of customer engagement for PayPal’s in-app crypto service from day one,&#8221; a PayPal spokesperson said. &#8220;Since we’ve launched, we’ve seen incredible and sustained engagement from our users. Consumers who buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency on our platform in the U.S. log on at 2x their previous rate,&#8221; they added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cryptocurrency will also be a key feature in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/paypals-new-super-app-is-ready-to-launch-will-also-include-messaging/">PayPal&#8217;s forthcoming &#8220;super app</a>,&#8221; which is due to roll out over the next several months.</p>
<p>The company would not comment on if or when it would expand its other cryptocurrency services to the U.K., including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/paypals-new-feature-allows-u-s-consumers-to-check-out-using-cryptocurrency/">its more recently launched &#8220;Checkout with Crypto,</a>&#8221; which allows customers to checkout using their cryptocurrency at millions of online businesses by first converting into fiat currency the crypto needed for the transaction. Instead, PayPal said it wanted to first learn and observe how its U.K. customers adopt the new offering to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency before rolling out more features and functionality.</p>
<p>Beyond its support for cryptocurrency in its own apps, PayPal&#8217;s venture capital arm has also made a number investments in crypto and the blockchain over the past months, including by participating in <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-06-17-TRM-Labs-Raises-14-Million-Series-A-Funding-Round">the $14 million Series A</a> for cryptocurrency risk management software TRM Labs; in <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-05-27-PayPal-Ventures-Invests-In-Talos-Series-A-Funding-Round">the $40 million Series A</a> for digital asset trading infrastructure company Talos; and in <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-03-02-PayPal-Ventures-Invests-In-TaxBits-Series-A-Funding-Round">the $100 million Series A</a> for crypto tax software company TaxBit.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pandemic has accelerated digital change and innovation across all aspects of our lives — including the digitization of money and greater consumer adoption of digital financial services,&#8221; Jose Fernandez da Ponte, vice president and general manager, Blockchain, Crypto and Digital Currencies at PayPal, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our global reach, digital payments expertise, and knowledge of consumer and businesses, combined with rigorous security and compliance controls provides us the unique opportunity, and the responsibility, to help people in the U.K. to explore cryptocurrency. We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the U.K., and around the world, to offer our support — and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Currently, PayPal offers support for cryptocurrency in the U.S., excluding Hawaii, and U.S. territories, in addition to the U.K., but says it&#8217;s exploring the potential for digital currencies through partnerships with licensed and regulated cryptocurrency platforms and with central banks elsewhere in the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more companies provide more API-first services, <a href="https://www.moesif.com/">Moesif</a> has developed a way for those companies to learn how their customers are utilizing them.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup is adding to its capital raise Monday with the announcement of a $12 million Series A round led by David Sacks and Arra Malekzadeh of Craft Ventures. Existing investor Merus Capital, which led Moesif’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/04/moesif-raises-3-5m-seed-round-to-provide-insight-into-api-usage/">$3.5 million seed round</a> in 2019, also participated in the round, bringing the company’s total raise to $15.5 million, Moesif co-founder and CEO Derric Gilling told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Gilling and Xing Wang founded Moesif in 2017 and went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/our-favorite-startups-from-alchemist-accelerator-batch-15/slide/2/">through the Alchemist Accelerator</a> in 2018.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Moesif raises $3.5M seed round to provide insight into API usage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/04/moesif-raises-3-5m-seed-round-to-provide-insight-into-api-usage/embed/#?secret=SWbz51xtVS" data-secret="SWbz51xtVS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Companies seeking data around API usage and workflow traditionally had to build that capability in-house on top of a tech like Snowflake, Gilling said. One of the problems with that was if someone wanted a report, the process was ad hoc, meaning they would file a ticket and wait until a team had time to run the report. In addition, companies find it difficult to accurately bill customers on usage or manage when someone exceeds the rate limits.</p>
<p>“We started to see people build on top of our platform and pull data on APIs, and they started asking us how to directly serve customers, like making them aware if they are hitting a rate limit,” Gilling added. “We started to build new functionality and a way to customize the look and feel of the platform.”</p>
<p>Moesif provides self-service analytics that can be accessed daily and features to scale analytics in a more cost-effective manner. Customers use it to monitor features to better understand when there are issues with the API, and there are additional capabilities to understand who is using the API, how often and who may be likely to stop using a product based on how they are using it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also now seeing its revenue grow over 20% month over month this year and adoption by more diverse use cases and larger companies. At the time of the seed round, the company was just getting started with analytics and user trials, Gilling said. Today, it boasts a customer list that includes UPS, Tomorrow.io, Symbl.ai and Deloitte.</p>
<p>The company has also gone from a team of two to nine employees, and Gilling expects to use the new funding to bolster that roster across engineering, sales, developer relations and customer success.</p>
<p>He is also focusing on being a thought leader in the space and is pushing go-to-market and building out a new set of features to monetize APIs and improve its dashboard to better differentiate Moesif from competitors, which he said focus more on server health versus customer usage.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Craft Ventures’ Malekzadeh is joining Moesif’s board. She was introduced to Gilling by another portfolio company and felt Moesif fit into Crafts’ thesis on SaaS companies.</p>
<p>Malekzadeh’s particular interest is in developer tools, and while in her previous position working at a startup developing APIs, she felt firsthand the pain point of not being able to know how those APIs were being used, how much customers should be billed and “was always bugging the product and engineering teams for reports.”</p>
<p>Moesif didn’t exist at the time she worked at the startup, and instead, her company had to build it own tools that turned out to be clunky, while at the same time recruiting top engineers that didn’t want to take up their time with building something that wasn’t the company’s core product.</p>
<p>“The two founders are highly technical, but they provided great content on their website that helped me learn about them,” Malekzadeh added. “One of the interesting things about them is that even though they are technical, they speak the same language as a business user, which makes them special as a developer-first company. Just the growth in their revenue was super impressive, and their customer references were glowing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese-backed and Africa-focused fintech company OPay raised $400 million in new financing led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/softbank-bets-on-fintech-startup-opay-at-2-billion-valuation?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a> Monday, valuing the company at $2 billion.</p>
<p>The round, which marks the fund&#8217;s first investment in an African startup, drew participation from existing investors like Sequoia Capital China, Redpoint China, Source Code Capital and Softbank Ventures Asia. Other investors, including DragonBall Capital and 3W Capital, also took part in the new financing round.</p>
<p>This news comes three months after The Information <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">reported</a> that the company was in talks to raise &#8220;up to $400 million at a $1.5 billion valuation&#8221; from a group of Chinese investors. The new financing also comes two years after OPay announced two funding rounds in 2019 — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/opera-founded-starup-opay-raises-50m-for-mobile-finance-in-nigeria/">$50 million</a> in June and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/17/operas-africa-fintech-startup-opay-gains-120m-from-chinese-investors/">$120 million Series B</a> in November.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, OPay CEO Yahui Zhou said OPay &#8220;wants to be the power that helps emerging markets reach a faster economic development.&#8221; The company, founded in 2018, had an exclusive presence in Nigeria before last year.</p>
<p>While the company started with providing customers with digital services in their everyday life, from mobility and logistics to e-commerce and fintech at cheap rates, those super app plans have been largely underwhelming.</p>
<p>Right now, it&#8217;s the company&#8217;s mobile money and payment arm that thrives the most. By simply allowing unbanked and underbanked users in Nigeria to send and receive money and pay bills through a network of thousands of agents, OPay has grown at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>The company plays in an extremely competitive fintech market. Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation, and with a <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/archives/sub-saharan-africa">large share of its people underbanked and unbanked</a>, fintech is the most promising digital sector in the country. The same can be said for the continent as a whole. Mobile money services have long catered to the needs of the underbanked. Per GSMA, Africa had more than 160 million active mobile money users generating over $495 billion in transaction value last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Parent company Opera reported that OPay’s monthly transactions grew 4.5x to over $2 billion in December last year. OPay also claims to process about 80% of bank transfers among mobile money operators in Nigeria and 20% of the country’s nonmerchant point of sales transactions. Last year, the company also said it acquired an international money transfer license with a WorldRemit partnership also in the works.</p>
<p>Per Bloomberg, the company’s monthly transaction volumes exceed $3 billion at the moment.</p>

<p>Last year, OPay expanded to Egypt, and according to the company, that&#8217;s an entry point to the Middle East market.</p>
<p class="paywall">In a statement, Kentaro Matsui, a managing director at SoftBank Group Corp, said, “We believe our investment will help the company extend its offering to adjacent markets and replicate its successful business model in Egypt and other countries in the region.”</p>
<p>SoftBank joins a growing list of high-flying investors (Dragoneer, Sequoia and SVB Capital, among others) that have cut their first checks in African ventures this year. As the continent continues to show promise, fintech remains its poster child. This year up to half of the total investments raised have emerged from the sector; it contributed to more than 25% last year.</p>
<p>In addition, fintech has produced the most mega-rounds so far. TymeBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/south-african-digital-bank-tymebank-lands-109m-from-uk-and-phillippines-investors/">raised $109 million</a> in February, Flutterwave <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">bagged a $170 million</a> round in March and Chipper Cash <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/">secured $100 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>OPay&#8217;s fundraise is the largest of the lot in terms of size and value, making it the second African fintech unicorn after Flutterwave and the third African unicorn after e-commerce giant Jumia. The three make up the five billion-dollar tech companies on the continent, which include Interswitch and Fawry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Figuring out size and cut of clothes through a website can suck the fun out of shopping online, but <a href="https://revery.ai/">Revery.ai</a> is developing a tool that leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence to create a better online dressing room experience.</p>
<p>Under the tutelage of University of Illinois Center for Computer Science advisrr David Forsyth, a team consisting of Ph.D. students Kedan Li, Jeffrey Zhang and Min Jin Chong, is creating what they consider to be the first tool using existing catalog images to process at a scale of over a million garments weekly, something previous versions of virtual dressing rooms had difficulty doing, Li told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>California-based Revery is part of Y Combinator’s summer 2021 cohort gearing up to complete the program later this month. YC has backed the company with $125,000. Li said the company already has a two-year runway, but wants to raise a $1.5 million seed round to help it grow faster and appear more mature to large retailers.</p>
<p>Before Revery, Li was working on another startup in the personalized email space, but was challenged in making it work due to free versions of already large legacy players. While looking around for areas where there would be less monopoly and more ability to monetize technology, he became interested in fashion. He worked with a different adviser to get a wardrobe collection going, but that idea fizzled out.</p>
<p>The team found its stride working with Forsyth and making several iterations on the technology in order to target business-to-business customers, who already had the images on their websites and the users, but wanted the computer vision aspect.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike its competitors that use 3D modeling or take an image and manually clean it up to superimpose on a model, Revery is using deep learning and computer vision so that the clothing drapes better and users can also <a href="https://demo.revery.ai/">customize their clothing model</a> to look more like them using skin tone, hair styles and poses. It is also fully automated, can work with millions of SKUs and be up and running with a customer in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Its virtual dressing room product is now live on many fashion e-commerce platforms, including Zalora-Global Fashion Group, one of the largest fashion companies in Southeast Asia, Li said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192327" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192327" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192327 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Landing-page-hero-gif.gif?w=654" alt="" width="654" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192327" class="wp-caption-text">Revery.ai landing page. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Revery.ai</p></div></p>
<p>“It’s amazing how good of results we are getting,” he added. “Customers are reporting strong conversion rates, something like three to five times, which they had never seen before. We released an A/B test for Zalora and saw a 380% increase. We are super excited to move forward and deploy our technology on all of their platforms.”</p>
<p>This technology comes at a time when online shopping jumped last year as a result of the pandemic. Just in the U.S., the e-commerce fashion industry made up <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3481/fashion-e-commerce-in-the-united-states/">29.5% of fashion retail sales</a> in 2020, and the market’s value is <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/ecommerce-fashion-industry">expected to reach $100 billion this year</a>.</p>
<p>Revery is already in talks with over 40 retailers that are “putting this on their roadmap to win in the online race,” Li said.</p>
<p>Over the next year, the company is focusing on getting more adoption and going live with more clients. To differentiate itself from competitors continuing to come online, Li wants to invest body type capabilities, something retailers are asking for. This type of technology is challenging, he said, due to there not being much in the way of diversified body shape models available.</p>
<p>He expects the company will have to collect proprietary data itself so that Revery can offer the ability for users to create their own avatar so that they can see how the clothes look.</p>
<p>“We might actually be seeing the beginning of the tide and have the right product to serve the need,” he added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Adra is bringing AI into the dentist's day-to-day workflow so they can spend less time finding cavities and more time with patients.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like other areas of healthcare, the dental industry is steadily embracing technology. But while much of it is in the orthodontic realm, other startups, like <a href="https://www.adra.ai/">Adra</a>, are bringing artificial intelligence into a dentist&#8217;s day-to-day workflow, particularly in finding cavities, of what will be a $435.08 billion <a href="https://emag.medicalexpo.com/the-global-dental-services-market-expected-to-grow-to-435-billion-in-2021-report/">global dental services market</a> this year.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based company was founded in 2021, but was an idea that started last year. Co-founder Hamed Fesharaki has been a dentist for over a decade and owns two clinics in Singapore.</p>
<p>He said dentists learn to read X-rays in dental school, but it can take a few years to get good at it. Dentists also often have just minutes to read them as they hop between patients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a result, dentists end up misdiagnosing cavities up to 40% of the time, co-founder Yasaman Nematbakhsh said. Her background is in imaging, where she developed an artificial intelligence machine identifying hard-to-see cancers, something Fesharaki thought could also be applied to dental medicine.</p>
<p>Providing the perspective of a more experienced dentist, Adra’s intent is to make every dentist “a super dentist,” Fesharaki told TechCrunch. Its software detects cavities and other dental problems on dental X-rays faster and 25% more accurately, so that clinics can use that time to better serve patients and increase revenue.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192318" style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192318" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192318 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg" alt="" width="912" height="668" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg 912w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg?resize=768,563 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg?resize=680,498 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cartoon_split_edited.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192318" class="wp-caption-text">Example of Adra&#8217;s software. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adra</p></div></p>
<p>“We are coming from the eye of an experienced dentist to help illustrate the problems by turning the X-rays into images to better understand what to look for,” he added. “Ultimately, the dentist has the final say, but we bring the experience element to help them compare and give them suggestions.”</p>
<p>By quickly pointing out the problem and the extent of it, dentists can decide in what way they want to treat it — for example, do a filling, a fluoride treatment or wait.</p>
<p>Along with third co-founder Shifeng Chen, the company is finishing up its time in Y Combinator’s summer cohort and has raised $250,000 so far. Fesharaki intends to do more formalized seed fundraising and wants to bring on more engineers to tackle user experience and add more features.</p>
<p>The company has a few clinics doing pilots and wants to attract more as it moves toward a U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance. Fesharaki expects it to take six to nine months to receive the clearance, and then Adra will be able to hit the market in late 2022 or early 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virgin Orbit is set to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisitions company (SPAC), the company has confirmed. The deal values the combined enterprise at $3.2 billion, and will provide Virgin Orbit with $483 million in cash at close, including a $100 million PIPE. The combined company will trade under the ticker VORB on the Nasdaq if and when the transaction concludes.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/12/virgin-orbit-in-talks-with-spac-for-3-billion-deal-to-go-public.html">CNBC reported</a> that such a deal was in the works, and it&#8217;s been a popular exit option for private space startups in recent months. Rocket Lab&#8217;s SPAC merger was just approved, for instance, and it&#8217;ll begin trading on Wednesday, and Richard Branson&#8217;s other space company, Virgin Galactic, was the first big SPAC deal that ushered in the craze.</p>
<p>Virgin Galactic, which focuses on flying people to suborbital space, and Virgin Orbit, which transports small satellite payloads to low Earth orbit using similar technology, used to be a single company before the two split to provide more focus on their respective markets. Both Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit made significant progress this year, achieving milestone flights, including a first full crew space launch for Galactic, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/virgin-orbit-successfully-launches-its-first-commercial-payloads-to-space/">first commercial satellite payload delivery mission for Orbit</a>.</p>

<p>Virgin Orbit launches its LauncherOne rocket from the wing of a customized 747 aircraft, which acts as a fully reusable first stage for the overall launch system. The company also has a subsidiary called VOX Space that acts as a dedicated launch service provider to the national security launch market.</p>
<p>NextGen, the blank check company that Virgin Orbit is merging with to complete this transaction, is led by a former Goldman Sachs partner, and will provide up to $383 million in cash from its funds held in trust when the merger goes through.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City finally launched </span><a href="https://abc7ny.com/lime-bird-veo-scooters/10957197/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its long-awaited scooter pilot </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the Bronx this past week. Over 90 parking corrals specifically for e-scooters have been installed across the borough, but residents can also park in unobstructive locations on the sidewalk. </span><b>Bird</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Lime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Veo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were the operators chosen for the pilot, each bringing their own sets of strengths. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird says it intends to focus on the mobility gap in the Bronx and will use its AI drop engine to ensure equitable deployment across all neighborhoods in the pilot zone. Veo is focused on safety and accessibility, bringing its Astro VS4, the first e-scooter with turn signals, to the mix, as well as its Cosmo, a seated e-scooter. Lime is also focusing on accessibility, with its Lime Able program, which offers an on-demand suite of adaptive vehicles. Lime also highlighted a safety quiz it will require new riders to take before hopping on a vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three companies have promised to partner with community organizations to hire locally as well as to offer discounted pricing for vulnerable groups.</span></p>
<h3>Big week for Bird</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only has Bird officially launched in NYC, but it was also awarded a 12-month permit to operate 1,500 scooters in San Francisco. Well, technically it’s </span><b>Scoot</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that got the permit, but Scoot is owned by Bird, and was kind of Bird’s backdoor way into the city. Last month, the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/the-station-bird-has-dramas-in-san-francisco-drone-delivery-startup-zipline-raises-250m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SFMTA asked Scoot to halt its operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just as the fresh round of scooter permits were kicking off because the company was implementing its fleet manager program with unauthorized subcontractors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, after careful evaluation of Scoot’s application, SFMTA determined Scoot has qualified for a permit to operate. Scoot intends to have its vehicles back on the roads in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird also officially </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/shared-micromobility-company-bird-launches-a-consumer-electric-bike-for-2299/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched its consumer e-bike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dubbed the Bird Bike (which I think is also the name of their shared e-bike). Bird hasn’t had the easiest time with profitability, and really, not many scooter companies have, so this is a chance for Bird to diversify, get a piece of the $68 billion e-bike sales pie and create more brand awareness across marketplaces. The bike costs $2,229 and consumer sales will likely make up about 10% of Bird’s revenue going forward, per the company’s S-4 filing.</span></p>

<p>Finally, Alex Wilhelm dug into new financial data released by Bird. The tl;dr: the quarterly data shows an improving economic model and a multiyear path to profitability.

<p>Imagine a future in which drivers don&#8217;t charge their electric vehicles but instead swap out the batteries at small, roadside pods. That&#8217;s the future <strong>Ample </strong>is imagining, and this week it announced a fresh $160 million funding round to scale its operations.</p>
<p>The internationally funded Series C was led by Moore Strategic Ventures with participation from PTT, a Thai state-owned oil and gas company, and Disruptive Innovation Fund. Existing investors Eneos, a Japanese petroleum and energy company, and Singapore’s public transit operator SMRT also participated. Ample’s total funding is now $230 million.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting idea but one that will require considerable buy-in from automakers to make it a reality &#8212; for example, by selling vehicles with either a standard battery or Ample&#8217;s battery system pre-built in. But according to Ample co-founders John de Souza and Khaled Hassounah, it wouldn&#8217;t be all that complicated for OEMs to separate the battery from the car.</p>
<p>“The marketing departments at the OEMs want to tell you that … ‘This is a super-duper battery that is very well integrated with the car; there’s no way you can separate it,’ ” Hassounah said. “The truth of the matter is they’re built completely separately and so true for almost — not almost, for every battery in the car, including a Tesla.</p>
<p>“Since we’ve built our system to be easy to interface with different vehicles, we’ve abstracted the battery component … from the vehicle,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got our attention this week …</strong></p>

<h3>Advanced Driver Assistance Systems</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">Regarding <strong>Tesla</strong> investigations, when it rains it pours. First, the <strong>National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">opened a preliminary investigation</a> into Tesla’s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system, citing 11 incidents in which vehicles crashed into parked first responder vehicles while the system was engaged.</p>
<p>The Tesla vehicles involved in the collisions were confirmed to have either have had engaged Autopilot or a feature called Traffic Aware Cruise Control, according to <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF">investigation documents</a> posted on the agency&#8217;s website. Most of the incidents took place after dark and occurred despite “scene control measures,” such as emergency vehicle lights, road cones and an illuminated arrow board signaling drivers to change lanes.</p>

<p>A few days later, <strong>Senators</strong> Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asked the new chair of the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> to investigate Tesla’s statements about the autonomous capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/two-senators-urge-the-ftc-to-investigate-tesla-over-full-self-driving-statements/">The senators expressed particular concern over Tesla misleading customers</a> into thinking their vehicles are capable of fully autonomous driving.</p>
<p>“Tesla’s marketing has repeatedly overstated the capabilities of its vehicles, and these statements increasingly pose a threat to motorists and other users of the road,” they said. “Accordingly, we urge you to open an investigation into potentially deceptive and unfair practices in Tesla’s advertising and marketing of its driving automation systems and take appropriate enforcement action to ensure the safety of all drivers on the road.”</p>
<h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Waymo</strong>, Alphabet’s self-driving arm, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">seriously scaling up</a> its autonomous trucking operations across Texas, Arizona and California. The company said it was building a dedicated trucking hub in Dallas and partnering with Ryder for fleet management services.</p>
<p>The Dallas hub will be a central launch point for testing not only the Waymo Driver, but also its transfer hub model, which is a mix of automated and manual trucking that optimizes transfer hubs near highways to ensure the Waymo Driver is sticking to main thoroughfares and human drivers are handling first and last mile deliveries.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Canoo </strong>is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ev-startup-canoo-is-gearing-up-for-production-in-oklahoma-factory/">expecting</a> 25,000 units out of its manufacturing partner VDL Nedcar&#8217;s facility by 2023, CEO Tony Aquila said during the company&#8217;s quarterly earnings call.</p>
<p>Year over year, Canoo upped its workforce from 230 to 656 total employees, 70% of which are hardware and software engineers. The startup’s operating expenses have increased from $19.8 million to $104.3 million YOY, with the majority of that increase coming from R&amp;D.</p>
<p><strong>Ford, Stellantis, Toyota and Volkswagen </strong>are among the carmakers this week that have announced production cuts in response to the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/covid-fuelled-semiconductor-crunch-chips-away-carmakers-2021-08-19/">ongoing global shortage</a> of semiconductors. It&#8217;s been a grim week.</p>
<p>A brief run-down: Toyota said it anticipated a production drop of anywhere from 60,000-90,000 vehicles across North America in August. Then Ford joined the chorus, saying it would temporarily close its F-150 factory in Kansas City. Volkswagen <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vw-says-might-have-cut-production-further-due-chip-shortage-2021-08-19/">told Reuters</a> it couldn&#8217;t &#8220;rule out further changes to production&#8221; in light of the chip shortage. And finally, Stellantis is halting production at one of its factories in France.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla </strong>unveiled what it&#8217;s calling the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/">&#8220;D1&#8221; computer chip</a> to power its advanced AI training supercomputer, Dojo, at its AI Day on Thursday. According to Tesla director Ganesh Venkataramanan, the D1 has GPU-level compute with CPU connectivity and twice the I/O bandwidth of “the state of the art networking switch chips that are out there today and are supposed to be the gold standards.”</p>
<p>Venkataramanan also revealed a “training tile” that integrates multiple chips to get higher bandwidth and an incredible computing power of 9 petaflops per tile and 36 terabytes per second of bandwidth. Together, the training tiles compose the Dojo supercomputer.</p>
<p>But there was more, of course. CEO Elon Musk also unveiled that the company is developing a humanoid robot, with a prototype expected in 2022. The bot is being proposed as a non-automotive robotic use case for the company’s work on neural networks and its Dojo advanced supercomputer.</p>
<p>Reality check: Tesla is not the first automaker, or company, to dip its toe into humanoid robot development.  <a href="https://asimo.honda.com/">Honda’s Asimo robot</a> has been around for decades, <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/30609642.html">Toyota</a> and <a href="https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/">GM</a> have their own robots and Hyundai recently acquired robotics company Boston Dynamic.</p>

<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>General Motors</strong> and <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/general-motors-and-att-will-offer-5g-connectivity-in-certain-vehicles-from-model-year-2024/">will be rolling out 5G connectivity</a> in select Chevy, Cadillac and GMC vehicles from model year 2024, in a boost that the two companies say will bring more reliable software updates, faster navigation and downloads and better coverage on roadways.</p>
<p>5G technology has generated a lot of hype for its promises to boost speed and reduce latency across a range of industries, a next-gen tech that everyone thought would change the world far sooner than now. That hasn’t happened (yet), in part because network rollout was much slower than people anticipated. So this announcement can be taken as a clear signal that, at the very least, AT&amp;T thinks its 5G network will be mature enough to handle “millions” of connected vehicles by 2024.</p>

<h3>Ride-hailing</h3>
<p><strong>RubiRides</strong>, a new ride-hailing company focuses on transporting kids, launched in the Washington D.C. metro area. The ride-hailing service is designed for children ages 7 and older. But the service also offers ride services for seniors and people with special needs. The company was founded by Noreen Butler, who was inspired to start the company after searching for transportation to support the busy schedules of her children.</p>
