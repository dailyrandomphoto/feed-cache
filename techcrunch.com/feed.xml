										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year we covered the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/heights-raises-2m-for-its-subscription-supplements-aimed-new-braincare-category/">Heights</a>, a new supplements startup in an increasingly hot category. <a href="https://wearefeel.com">Feel</a>, is a year-old UK startup with another twist on this world: pure nutritional supplements. It’s now closed a $6.2 million investment, led by Fuel Ventures, with participation from TMT Investments, Sova VC, Richard Longhurst (founder of LoveHoney.com) and Igor Ryabenkiy (founder and GP of Altair Capital).</p>
<p>Feel founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/borhod/?originalSubdomain=uk">Boris Hodakel</a> says he spun his startup up after looking at the UK’s big health and retail brands including Graze, Tesco, Bulk Powders and Simba Sleep.</p>
<p>In many ways Feel is very akin to Graze. The supplements arrive in a post-box-friendly box and is available in a range of subscription packages. This is basically ‘Graze nuts, but for supplements.’</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Feel has a direct-to-consumer subscription model, and is claiming a 60x growth in its first year and 21,000 active subscriptions.</p>
<p>Hodakel’s contention is that while Feel provides higher grade supplements to consumers which cost more to produce, it manages to keep costs down for consumers via direct-to-consumer model.</p>
<p>Hodakel, founder and CEO of Feel said: “Not all vitamins are created equal and the majority you find on retail shelves have a dirty formula that is difficult to absorb by the body, missing natural elements. We’re the cleanest alternative in the market &#8211; backed up by science &#8211;  and continually invest in making our formulas as effective as possible while still affordable.”</p>
<p>He says he started Feel because, having a skin problem, supplements were part of his health routine, but &#8220;the aha moment&#8221; happened he realized how many fillers were in normal supplements. &#8220;All our formulas are researched and formulated in-house, and we keep updating them, like our flagship multivitamin in just two years is already in its 3rd version,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mark Pearson, managing partner at Fuel Ventures added: “The growth and the expansion of Feel’s product line present a really exciting time for Feel and we are supporting them in becoming a significant disruptor to the health supplement market.” </p>
<p>Alexander Chikunov, Partner at Sova VC added, “Feel is in the process of disrupting consumer habits around vitamin intake, and changing a marketplace worth $144bn by providing its customers with top-quality products, combined with flawless and friendly service.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the past ten years, an investment team led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/winterchristian/">Christian Winter</a>, Jan Sessenhausen, Helmut Klawitter and Wilken Engelbracht worked principally with German family offices, investing in startups such as Klarna, Zalando and Delivery Hero that went on to be worth around €80 billion in total. Today they are launching a VC firm of their own, Cusp Capital, with €300 million ($361m) under their belt. </p>
<p>Cusp Capital will back early-stage young tech companies across Europe. Its LPs include institutional investors such as the European Investment Fund, KfW Capital, RAG Stiftung, and NRW.BANK, alongside family offices and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>In a statement Christian Winter, general partner, said: “Cusp Capital is built on and incorporates our experience as investors over the past decade. We have worked in various operational roles and accompanied more than 50 early-stage companies to successful exits and IPOs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to forming Cusp, the team of partners had worked largely with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erivan_Haub">Haub</a> Family office  and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengelmann_Group">Tengelmann Group</a>.</p>
<p>Over a call, he told me the firm is planning lead deals in Seed and Series A rounds, and co-lead in growth rounds. They plan to do 25-30 investments with this fund or a 6-7 a year period.</p>
<p>Cusp’s Initial investments will range from mid-to-high single-digit million Euros and it says it has already signed the first term sheets for investments.</p>
<p>Jan Sessenhausen, General Partner of Cusp Capital says: “We dedicate a lot of time to developing investment hypotheses with global relevance. We use these hypotheses to identify promising companies, and actively approach entrepreneurs with our expertise. Having our own perspective early on allows us to see eye-to-eye with founders and have the deep discussions needed to help them realize their full potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of those hypotheses is around focused sustainability. The firm says this will be a core theme for its investing, going forward. In addition, widening access to financing for lower-income consumers will also be a feature of its investing thesis.</p>
<p>Cusp Capital is headquartered in Essen, with a second office in Berlin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One after another, Chinese tech giants have announced their plans for the auto space over the last few months. Some internet companies, like search engine provider Baidu, decided to recruit help from a traditional carmaker to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/baidu-electric-car-making/">produce cars</a>. Xiaomi, which makes its own smartphones but has stressed for years it&#8217;s a light-asset firm making money from software services, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/xiaomi-ev-subsidiary/">jumped on the automaking bandwagon</a>. Industry observers are now speculating who will be the next. Huawei naturally comes to their minds.</p>
<p>Huawei seems well-suited for building cars &#8212; at least more qualified than some of the pure internet firms &#8212; thanks to its history in manufacturing and supply chain management, brand recognition, and vast retail network. But the telecom equipment and smartphone maker repeatedly denied reports claiming it was launching a car brand. Instead, it says its role is to be a Tier 1 supplier for automakers or OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).</p>
<p>Huawei is not a carmaker, the company&#8217;s rotating chairman Eric Xu reiterated recently at the firm&#8217;s annual analyst conference in Shenzhen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Since 2012, I have personally engaged with the chairmen and CEOs of all major car OEMs in China as well as executives of German and Japanese automakers. During this process, I found that the automotive industry needs Huawei. It doesn&#8217;t need the Huawei brand, but instead, it needs our ICT [information and communication technology] expertise to help build future-oriented vehicles,&#8221; said Xu, who said the strategy has not changed since it was incepted in 2018.</p>
<p>There are three major roles in auto production: branded vehicle manufacturers like Audi, Honda, Tesla, and soon Apple; Tier 1 companies that supply car parts and systems directly to carmakers, including established ones like Bosch and Continental, and now Huawei; and lastly, chip suppliers including Nvidia, Intel and NXP, whose role is increasingly crucial as industry players make strides toward highly automated vehicles. Huawei also makes in-house car chips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huawei wants to be the next-generation Bosch,&#8221; an executive from a Chinese robotaxi startup told TechCrunch, asking not to be named.</p>
<p>Huawei makes its position as a Tier 1 supplier unequivocal. So far it has secured three major customers: BAIC, Chang&#8217;an Automobile, and Guangzhou Automobile Group.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t have too many of these types of in-depth collaboration,&#8221; Xu assured.</p>
<h2>L4 autonomy?</h2>

<p>Arcfox, a new electric passenger car brand under state-owned carmaker BAIC, debuted its Alpha S model quipped with Huawei&#8217;s &#8220;HI&#8221; systems, short for Huawei Inside (not unlike &#8220;Powered by Intel&#8221;), during China&#8217;s annual auto show on Saturday. The electric sedan, priced between 388,900 yuan and 429,900 yuan (about $60,000 and $66,000), comes with Huawei functions including an operating system driven by Huawei&#8217;s Kirin chip, a range of apps that run on HarmonyOS, automated driving, fast charging, and cloud computing.</p>
<p>Perhaps most eye-catching is that Alpha S has achieved Level 4 capabilities, which Huawei confirmed with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a bold statement, for it means that the car will not require human intervention in most scenarios, that is, drivers can take their hands off the wheels and nap.</p>
<p>There are some nuances to this claim, though. In a recent <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2021-04-17/doc-ikmyaawc0275912.shtml">interview</a>, Su Qing, general manager for autonomous driving at Huawei, said Alpha S is L4 in terms of &#8220;experience&#8221; but L2 according to &#8220;legal&#8221; responsibilities. China has only permitted a small number of companies to test autonomous vehicles without safety drivers in restricted areas and is far from letting consumer-grade driverless cars roam urban roads.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Huawei&#8217;s<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;L4&#8221; functions were shown during a demo, during which the Arcfox car traveled for 1,000 kilometers in a busy Chinese city without human intervention, though a safety driver was present in the driving seat. Automating the car is a stack of sensors, including three lidars, six millimeter-wave radars, 13 ultrasonic radars and 12 cameras, as well as Huawei&#8217;s own chipset for automated driving.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This would be much better than Tesla,&#8221; Xu said of the car&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>But some argue the Huawei-powered vehicle isn&#8217;t L4 by strict definition. The debate seems to be a matter of semantics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our cars you see today are already L4, but I can assure you, I dare not let the driver leave the car,&#8221; Su said. &#8220;Before you achieve really big MPI [miles per intervention] numbers, don&#8217;t even mention L4. It&#8217;s all just demos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not L4 if you can&#8217;t remove the safety driver,&#8221; the executive from the robotaxi company argued. &#8220;A demo can be done easily, but removing the driver is very difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This technology that Huawei claims is different from L4 autonomous driving,&#8221; said a director working for another Chinese autonomous vehicle startup. &#8220;The current challenge for L4 is not whether it <em>can</em> be driverless but how to be driverless <em>at all times.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>L4 or not, Huawei is certainly willing to splurge on the future of driving. This year, the firm is on track to spend over $1 billion on smart vehicle components and tech, Xu said at the analyst event.</p>
<h2>A 5G future</h2>
<p>Many believe 5G will play a key role in accelerating the development of driverless vehicles. Huawei, the world&#8217;s biggest telecom equipment maker, would have a lot to reap from 5G rollouts across the globe, but Xu argued the next-gen wireless technology isn&#8217;t a necessity for self-driving vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make autonomous driving a reality, the vehicles themselves have to be autonomous. That means a vehicle can drive autonomously without external support,&#8221; said the executive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Completely relying on 5G or 5.5G for autonomous driving will inevitably cause problems. What if a 5G site goes wrong? That would raise a very high bar for mobile network operators. They would have to ensure their networks cover every corner, don&#8217;t go wrong in any circumstances and have high levels of resilience. I think that&#8217;s simply an unrealistic expectation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huawei may be happy enough as a Tier 1 supplier if it ends up taking over Bosch&#8217;s market. Many Chinese companies are shifting away from Western tech suppliers towards homegrown options in anticipation of future sanctions or simply to seek cheaper alternatives that are just as robust. Arcfox is just the beginning of Huawei&#8217;s car ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ridedott.com">Dott</a> has raised a new $85 million Series B funding round — this round is a mix of equity and asset-backed debt financing. Belgium-based investment company <a href="https://www.sofinagroup.com">Sofina</a> is leading the investment. Dott is a micromobility startup that is better known for its colorful electric scooters that you can find across several European cities.</p>
<p>The company operates a fleet of 30,000 electric scooters in five countries. Users can download a mobile app and unlock a scooter through the app. The company charges an unlocking fee as well as a per-minute price.</p>
<p>During its early days, Dott positioned itself as a capital-efficient, sustainable e-scooter company. It has raised a lot less money than Bird or Lime and it has taken a different approach when it comes to operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, Dott has always had its own warehouses to charge and repair vehicles. The startup doesn’t work with third-party logistics providers. Dott has hired its own in-house team of logistics employees.</p>
<p>Similarly, Dott tries to repair, reuse and recycle scooters as much as possible. Thanks to swappable batteries and electric trucks, the company tries to keep its CO2 emissions as low as possible in the cities where it operates.</p>
<p>As a result, the company has won permits to operate in Paris and Lyon following tender processes. Overall, the company operates in a dozen cities in France, Italy, Belgium, Germany and Poland. Tier, a European competitor, has been expanding more aggressively and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/e-scooter-startup-tier-raises-250-million-round-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/">has raised $250 million</a> in November 2020.</p>
<p>In addition to Sofina, new and existing investors include EQT Ventures, Prosus Ventures, Aberdeen Standard Investments, Estari, Expon Capital, Felix Capital, FJ Labs, Invest-NL, McRock Capital and Quadia.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand beyond e-scooters with a new bike-sharing service. Dott already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/dott-to-expand-beyond-e-scooters-with-bike-sharing-service/">shared images</a> of its e-bike. It should be launching this summer.</p>
<p>Dott also plans to expand to other cities and countries, starting with Spain and the U.K. As you can see, Dott doesn’t want to launch a hundred cities at once. It is slowly rolling out its service in new cities. It is currently EBIT positive across all cities and Dott probably wants to keep it this way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-based fintech <a href="https://stacs.io/">Hashstacs Pte Ltd (STACS)</a> announced today it has raised $3.6 million USD in pre-Series A funding. The company develops blockchain platforms that can work with financial institutions’ existing infrastructure, and its core technology is also used in GreenSTACS for environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments. The round was led by Wavemaker Partners, which focuses on enterprise and deep tech companies in Southeast Asia, with participation from the Tribe Accelerator, a program for blockchain startups backed by the Singaporean government. STACS participated in Tribe last year, along with Project Ubin, the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s blockchain-based multi-currency payments network initiative.</p>

<p>Founded in 2019, STACS has now raised a total of more than $6 million and is preparing to raise Series A funding later this year. The company’s goal is to fix fragmentation in the tech systems used by financial institutions that can result in capital being locked in international clearing systems, a build-up of transaction fees and fines for trades that fail to settle. Its core solution is a <a href="https://stacs.io/stacs-technology/">technology stack</a> that is built around STACS blockchain. It allows clients to integrate payment platforms (including Ubin), trading platforms and external software like user management systems, while enabling smart contracts and digital ledgers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>STACS’ products include a real-time trade processing platform that is used by clients like Eastspring Investments and BNP Paribas Securities Service. Some of its other clients are Deutsche Bank, Bursa Malaysia, EFG Bank and Bluecell Intelligence. STACS co-founder and managing director Benjamin Soh told TechCrunch that STACS is targeting a network of more than 30 institutions by the end of this year.</p>
<p>GreenSTACS <a href="https://en.prnasia.com/releases/apac/-c-o-r-r-e-c-t-i-o-n-bluecell-intelligence--313550.shtml">launched last month</a> in a collaboration with Bluecell Intelligence to help companies certify and monitor green and sustainability-related loans and bonds.</p>
<p>Soh said in an email that STACS received many requests from financial institutions that needed to perform impact monitoring on ESG projects, but were not able to do so effectively because “information sources are asymmetric, there is no common data infrastructure and serving of ESG financing is typically too inefficient.”</p>
<p>STACS’ goal is to make GreenSTACS “the common infrastructure” for ESG financing and impact monitoring, he added. The platform enables loan and bond parameters to be programmed into security tokens and connects with data sources, like IoT devices or satellite images, to create real-time impact reports on a distributed ledger. This helps prevent “greenwashing,” a term that refers to making something seem more environmentally-friendly or sustainable than it really is.</p>
<p>“Essentially, this would boost investors’ and banks’ confidence with green financing by ensuring green money is strictly used in achieving pledged green goals and policies,” said Soh.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Wavemaker general partner Gavin Lee said, “There is an immense opportunity to help financial institutions process large volumes of trade more quickly, securely and accurately while reducing costs and illiquid capital. As an enterprise distributed ledger technology provider, STACS has productized a secure layer that can be deployed instantly above existing infrastructure. Enterprise sales is never easy for young companies, but Benjamin is a convincing and seasoned serial entrepreneur who has secured numerous leading financial institutions as key clients.”</p>

<p>Indonesian startup <a href="https://colearn.id/">CoLearn</a> started as a chain of physical tutoring centers and was in the process of shifting to a hybrid offline-online model when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The team sensed that remote learning would permanently change how students want to be tutored and decided to focus completely on its app, which launched in August 2020. CoLearn has since been downloaded more than 3.5 million times and has about one million active users, mostly students in grades 7 to 12.</p>
<p>The company announced today it has raised $10 million in Series A funding co-led by Alpha Wave Incubation and edtech-focused GSV Ventures. This marks the first time both have made an investment in Indonesia. The round also included participation from returning investors Sequoia Capital India’s Surge and AC Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of the Jakarta-based company’s goals is to improve educational standards in Indonesia. The country’s PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment, a global ranking system created by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) rankings <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/12/04/not-">are in the bottom 10% for math, science and reading</a>. CoLearn’s goal is to help move up Indonesia’s PISA ratings to the top 50% over the next five years.</p>
<p>CoLearn’s app offers more than 250,000 pre-recorded videos with homework help. The videos serve as a hook to convince students (or their parents) to sign up for CoLearn’s live online classes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140770" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140770" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2140770" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png" alt="Screenshots from CoLearn, an Indonesian online learning app" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140770" class="wp-caption-text">CoLearn screenshots</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s co-founders are Abhay Saboo, Marc Irawan and BYJU product team alum Sandeep Devaram. Despite being the world’s fourth most populous country with 270 million people, Indonesia has not seen the same level of investment and innovation in its educational infrastructure as countries like China or India, Saboo told TechCrunch. “We’re trying to solve the problem of how do you change mindsets, how do you change motivation, how do you increase in confidence levels?”</p>
<p>CoLearn started its offline in business in 2018, before shifting to a hybrid model. Once the pandemic hit, the company decided to go fully online. Even after schools reopen, the team anticipates that most students will prefer the convenience of online afterschool learning because going to brick-and-mortar tutoring centers can eat up hours of their time each day, Saboo said.</p>
<p>CoLearn&#8217;s users ask about 5 million questions through the app each month. Its AI platform matches them with video tutorials, recorded by more than 400 tutors, that break down key concepts. Saboo said creating engaging videos instead of presenting solutions in a diagram is one of the ways CoLearn differentiates from competitors like SnapAsk, which raised $35 million last year to expand in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>“What we realized is that kids are really craving a step-by-step explanation and this is the TikTok generation, so if a picture says a thousand words, then a video says a million,” he said. He added that students often hit pause on the video when they think they have the answer to a question, before skipping to the end to see if they got it right, indicating that they want to understand concepts instead of simply getting a solution.</p>
<p>CoLearn’s live online classes will be its main priority going forward and the startup hopes to replicate the success of companies like China’s Yuanfadao and Zuoyebang. As part of that goal, it runs teacher training programs and expects to train more than 200 teachers over the next two years, especially in STEM subjects. The company may eventually scale into other countries that have similar issues with their education systems, but Saboo said CoLearn’s plan is to focus on Indonesia for at last the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Other investors in CoLearn include Leo Capital, TNB Aura, S7V, January Capital, Alpha JWC, Taurus Ventures, Alter Global and Mahanusa Capital.</p>
<p>In press statement, GSV Ventures managing partner Deborah Quazzo said, “The opportunity to build efficacious learning solutions for the fourth largest country in the world is vast. The greatest businesses are created when entrepreneurs tackle large, important problems and CoLearn is doing that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://payhawk.com">Payhawk</a> has raised a $20 million funding round. QED Investors is leading the round with existing investor Earlybird Digital East also participating. Payhawk is building a unified system to manage all the money that is going in and out.</p>
<p>Essentially, companies switching to Payhawk can replace several services they already use and that didn’t interact well with each other. Payhawk lets you issue corporate cards for your employees, manage invoices and track payments from a single interface.</p>
<p>After signing up, customers get their own banking details with a dedicated IBAN. You can connect with your existing bank account, load funds to your Payhawk account and start using it in multiple ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Compared to other companies working on similar products, Payhawk gives each customer their own IBAN, which means they can receive third-party payments.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Payhawk is that customers can issue virtual and physical cards for employees with different rules. You can set up a team budget, configure an approval workflow for large transactions and let Payhawk handle receipt collection from those card transactions.</p>
<p>You can upload invoices to manage them through Payhawk. The startup tries to automatically extract data from those invoices for easier reconciliation. Payhawk also lets you reimburse employees. The service acts as a single source of truth for your company’s spending. Finally, you can connect Payhawk with your existing ERP system.</p>
<p>As a software-as-a-service solution, you pay a monthly subscription fee that will vary depending on optional features and the number of active cards. Clients include LuxAir, Lotto24, Viking Life, ATU, Gtmhub, MacPaw and By Miles. Overall, the startup has 200 clients.</p>
<p>The company has been growing nicely as revenue doubled in Q1 2021. It currently accepts clients in the European Union and the U.K. but it already plans to expand beyond those markets. Up next, Payhawk plans to launch credit cards, more currencies and tighter integration with corporate bank accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Surprise! It’s another Apple Event. Gone are the days of getting a few weeks&#8217; notice before these events now that they’re entirely virtual (at least until 2022, most likely). Instead, the company just dropped the news last week.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there have been plenty of rumors leading up to tomorrow’s big event &#8212; and perhaps even a few hints in the invite itself. After skipping last year’s spring event, due to cresting COVID-19 numbers in the U.S., the company has grown much more comfortable dropping semi-regular livestreamed events. As ever, we’ll be covering the event as it unfolds, starting at 10AM PT/1PM ET. But here’s what we expect to see, along with the customary high-production-value sweeping-drone transitions.</p>
<p>The closest thing we have to a surefire bet is the arrival of new iPads, keeping in line with what looks to be a finger-drawn image on the invite. Specifically, the iPad Pro is leading the way. The high-end tablet has been rumored to be getting a refresh at some point this season, so no time like the present.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1961508" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="946" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=150,139 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=300,277 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=768,709 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=680,628 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=1536,1418 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The biggest news is likely to be the addition of a<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display"> mini-LED display</a> for the 12.9-inch model (a refresh to the 11-inch is coming sometime down the road). Benefits include increased brightness, better battery life and less potential for image burn-in. The tech would arrive in the place of the OLED currently found on iPhone models.</p>
<p>The improved screen technology is said to add <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/new-ipad-pro-thicker-mini-led-display/">a bit of thickness</a> to the design, which otherwise is largely unchanged. Supply constraints could ultimately put a damper on availability, so there’s a possibility that the product could be announced tomorrow, but delayed for a later date.</p>
<p>There’s likely to be a processor update, as well. Rumor has it that the A14X will utilize the same technology that forms the foundation of the M1 chip found on recent Macs. That could, in turn, bring a real big performance bump.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1798254" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="894" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=300,262 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=768,671 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=680,594 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=1536,1341 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=2048,1789 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum is the iPad mini. The 8.4-inch tablet would be getting its first major boost in two years. The updates are said to be less pronounced than on the Pro. The classic iPad design language will remain, though the device is said to be getting a performance boost courtesy of new chips. A new Apple Pencil is rumored to be on the way, as well, though details are scarce.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1969511" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="615" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>And could this be the event where Apple finally gives the world <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">AirTags</a>? All signs point to “definitely maybe.” After several delays, the company’s Tile competitor is said to finally be arriving. At the very least, the timing makes sense. After all, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">just opened up third-party “Find My” access</a>, along with a bunch of compatible devices. That includes direct competitor, the Chipolo ONE Spot.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1775574" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Also on the maybe pile is a new Apple TV featuring a Find My compatible remote. That seems like a slam dunk, as one of the most frequently lost products in history. With Apple on a two-year line-wide refresh, some new silicon Macs could be on the list. The most likely candidate? At the moment it seems to be a long-awaited refresh to the iMac line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.druva.com/">Druva</a>, a software company that sells cloud data backup services, announced today that it has closed a $147 million round of capital. Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), a group that <a href="https://www.cdpq.com/en/about-us/history">manages Quebec&#8217;s pension fund</a>, led the round, which also saw participation from Neuberger Berman. Prior investors including Atreides Management and Viking Global Investors put capital into the deal, as well.</p>
<p>Druva last raised a $130 million round led by Viking in mid-2019 at around a $1 billion valuation. At the time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/saas-data-protection-provider-druva-nabs-130m-now-at-a-1b-valuation-acquires-cloudlanes/">TechCrunch commented</a> that the company&#8217;s software-as-a-service (SaaS) backup service was tackling a large market. (TechCrunch also covered the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/eyeing-an-ipo-druva-raises-51m-for-its-data-backup-recovery-and-discovery-services/">$51 million round back in 2016</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/cloud-data-management-startup-druva-raises-80m/">$80 million raise from 2017</a>.)</p>
<p>Since then SaaS has continued to grow at a rapid clip, including a strong 2020 spurred on by COVID-19 boosting digital transformation efforts at companies of all sizes. In that context, it&#8217;s not surprising to see Druva put together a new capital round.</p>
<p>A recent tie-up between Dell and Druva, first <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2021/01/22/dell-emc-druva-backup-as-a-service-offering/">reported in January of this year</a>, was <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2021/04/06/dell-emc-powerprotect-backup-service/">formally announced earlier this month</a>. The selection of Druva by Dell could help provide the unicorn with a customer base to sell into for some time. TechCrunch wrote about Druva <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/why-im-hitting-pause-on-arr-focused-coverage/">earlier this year</a>, during the reporting process the company said that it had &#8220;almost tripled its annual revenue in three years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its new round did include some secondary shares, which Neuberger Berman managing director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raman-gambhir-38414540/">Raman Gambhir</a> described as difficult to snag during a call with TechCrunch. He explained that some of the secondary sales were due to some prior funds reaching their end-of-life cycle. Druva CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspreets/">Jaspreet Singh</a> stressed that his backers are working to do what&#8217;s best for the company instead of merely maximizing their returns during a joint interview.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why I&#8217;m hitting pause on ARR-focused coverage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/why-im-hitting-pause-on-arr-focused-coverage/embed/#?secret=zmvDGYrc0f" data-secret="zmvDGYrc0f" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Singh told TechCrunch that business at Druva is accelerating. Normally we&#8217;d note that that sounds like IPO fodder, especially as Druva passed the $100 million ARR threshold back in 2019. However, as the company has been making IPO noise for some time, it&#8217;s hard to predict when it might pull the trigger. Our coverage of the company&#8217;s 2016 round noted that the company could go public within a year. And our coverage of its 2019 investment included Singh telling TechCrunch that an IPO was 12 to 18 months away.</p>
<p>It probably is, now, but that&#8217;s beside the point. With refreshed accounts, a market moving in its direction, and some early investor relieved in its latest investment the company has quarters worth of time to play with. Still, Singh did stress that its new financing round did select investors that he said is building a long-term position; that&#8217;s the sort of verbiage that CEOs break out when they are building a pre-IPO cap table.</p>
<p>Gambhir told TechCrunch that his firm has already requested shares in Druva&#8217;s eventual IPO. Perhaps we&#8217;ll see Fidelity show up with a $50 million check in a few months.</p>
<p>Every startup that raises capital tells the media that they are going to use the funds to expand their staff, double down on their tech and, often, invest in their go-to-market (GTM) motion. Druva is no exception, but its CEO did tell TechCrunch that his company currently has over 200 open GTM positions. That&#8217;s quite a few. Presumably that spend will help the company keep its growth rate strong in percentage terms as it does, finally, look to list.</p>
<p>This is yet another growth round for a late-stage, enterprise-facing software company. But it&#8217;s also a round into a company that had to move its operations to the United States when it was founded, at the behest of its investors per Singh. And Druva has done some pretty neat cloud work, it told TechCrunch earlier this year, to ensure that it can defend software-like margins despite material storage loads.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an S-1 that we&#8217;re looking forward to. Start the countdown.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Data isn&#8217;t abstract — it has a direct impact on people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>In 2019, an AI-powered delivery robot<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f5bd21da-33b8-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2"> momentarily blocked</a> a wheelchair user from safely accessing the curb when crossing a busy road. Speaking about the incident, the person noted, &#8220;It&#8217;s important that the development of technologies [doesn&#8217;t put] disabled people on the line as collateral.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside other minority groups, people with disabilities have long been harmed by flawed data and data tools. Disabilities are diverse, nuanced and dynamic; they don&#8217;t fit within the formulaic structure of AI, which is programmed to find patterns and form groups. Because AI treats any outlier data as &#8220;noise&#8221; and disregards it, too often people with disabilities are excluded from its conclusions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</p>
<p>Take for example the<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/07/777438412/feds-say-self-driving-uber-suv-did-not-recognize-jaywalking-pedestrian-in-fatal-"> case of Elaine Herzberg</a>, who was struck and killed by a self-driving Uber SUV in 2018. At the time of the collision, Herzberg was pushing a bicycle, which meant Uber&#8217;s system struggled to categorize her and flitted between labeling her as a &#8220;vehicle,&#8221; &#8220;bicycle,&#8221; and &#8220;other.&#8221; The tragedy raised many questions for people with disabilities; would a person in a wheelchair or a scooter be at risk of the same fatal misclassification?</p>
<p>We need a new way of collecting and processing data. &#8220;Data&#8221; ranges from personal information, user feedback, resumes, multimedia, user metrics and much more, and it&#8217;s constantly being used to optimize our software. However, it&#8217;s not done so with the understanding of the spectrum of nefarious ways that it can and <em>is </em>used in the wrong hands, or when principles are not applied to each touchpoint of building.</p>

<p>Our products are long overdue for a new, fairer data framework to ensure that data is managed with people with disabilities in mind. If it isn’t, people with disabilities will face more friction, and dangers, in a day-to-day life that is increasingly dependent on digital tools.</p>
<h2>Misinformed data hampers the building of good tools</h2>
<p>Products that lack accessibility might not stop people with disabilities from leaving their homes, but they can stop them from accessing pivot points of life like quality healthcare, education and on-demand deliveries.</p>
<p>Our tools are a product of their environment. They reflect their creators’ worldview and subjective lens. For too long, the same groups of people have been overseeing faulty data systems. It&#8217;s a closed loop, where underlying biases are perpetuated and groups that were already invisible remain unseen. But as data progresses, that loop becomes a snowball. We’re dealing with machine-<em>learning</em> models — if they&#8217;re taught long enough that &#8220;not being X&#8221; (read: white, able-bodied, cisgendered) means not being &#8220;normal,&#8221; they will evolve by building on that foundation.</p>
<p>Data is interlinked in ways that are invisible to us. It’s not enough to say that your algorithm won’t exclude people with registered disabilities. Biases are present in other sets of data. For example, in the United States it’s illegal to refuse someone a mortgage loan because they’re Black. But by basing the process heavily on credit scores — which have<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/10/16/how-race-affects-your-credit-score/"> inherent biases</a> detrimental to people of color — banks indirectly<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-modern-day-redlining-20180215-story.html"> exclude</a> that segment of society.</p>
<p>For people with disabilities, indirectly biased data could potentially be frequency of physical activity or number of hours commuted per week. Here’s a concrete example of how indirect bias translates to software: If a hiring algorithm studies candidates&#8217; facial movements during a video interview, a person with a cognitive disability or mobility impairment will experience<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/algorithmic-bias-people-with-disabilities.html"> different barriers</a> than a fully able-bodied applicant.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4DeTl4xHSp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/4-signs-your-product-is-not-as-accessible-as-you-think/">4 signs your product is not as accessible as you think</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 signs your product is not as accessible as you think&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/4-signs-your-product-is-not-as-accessible-as-you-think/embed/#?secret=4DeTl4xHSp" data-secret="4DeTl4xHSp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The problem also stems from people with disabilities not being viewed as part of businesses&#8217; target market. When companies are in the early stage of brainstorming their ideal users, people’s disabilities often don&#8217;t figure, especially when they&#8217;re less noticeable — like mental health illness. That means the initial user data used to iterate products or services doesn&#8217;t come from these individuals. In fact, <a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/2020-state-of-digital-accessibility-report/">56%</a> of organizations still don’t routinely test their digital products among people with disabilities.</p>
<p>If tech companies proactively included individuals with disabilities on their teams, it’s far more likely that their target market would be more representative. In addition, all tech workers need to be aware of and factor in the visible and invisible exclusions in their data. It’s no simple task, and we need to collaborate on this. Ideally, we’ll have more frequent conversations, forums and knowledge-sharing on how to eliminate indirect bias from the data we use daily.</p>
<h2>We need an ethical stress test for data</h2>
<p>We test our products all the time — on usability, engagement and even logo preferences. We know which colors perform better to convert paying customers, and the words that resonate most with people, so why aren’t we setting a bar for data ethics?</p>
<p>Ultimately, the responsibility of creating ethical tech does not just lie at the top. Those laying the brickwork for a product day after day are also liable. It was the Volkswagen engineer (not the company CEO) who was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41053740">sent to jail</a> for developing a device that enabled cars to evade U.S. pollution rules.</p>
<p>Engineers, designers, product managers; we all have to acknowledge the data in front of us and think about <em>why</em> we collect it and <em>how </em>we collect it. That means dissecting the data we&#8217;re requesting and analyzing what our motivations are. Does it always make sense to ask about someone&#8217;s disabilities, sex or race? How does having this information benefit the end user?</p>
<p>At Stark, we&#8217;ve developed a five-point framework to run when designing and building any kind of software, service or tech. We have to address:</p>
<ol>
<li>What data we&#8217;re collecting.</li>
<li>Why we&#8217;re collecting it.</li>
<li>How it will be used (and how it can be misused).</li>
<li>Simulate IFTTT: &#8220;If this, then that.&#8221; Explain possible scenarios in which the data can be used nefariously, and alternate solutions. For instance, how users can be impacted by an at-scale data breach? What happens if this private information becomes public to their family and friends?</li>
<li>Ship or trash the idea.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we can only explain our data using vague terminology and unclear expectations, or by stretching the truth, we shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to have that data. The framework forces us to break down data in the most simple manner. If we can&#8217;t, it&#8217;s because we’re not yet equipped to handle it responsibly.</p>

<h2>Innovation has to include people with disabilities</h2>
<p>Complex data technology is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/14/1016122/these-five-ai-developments-will-shape-2021-and-beyond/">entering new sectors</a> all the time, from vaccine development to robotaxis. Any bias against individuals with disabilities in these sectors stops them from accessing the most cutting-edge products and services. As we become more dependent on tech in every niche of our lives, there&#8217;s greater room for exclusion in how we carry out everyday activities.</p>
<p>This is all about forward thinking and baking inclusion into your product at the start. Money and/or experience aren’t limiting factors here — changing your thought process and development journey is free; it’s just a conscious pivot in a better direction. While the upfront cost may be a heavy lift, the profits you’d lose from not tapping into these markets, or because you end up retrofitting your product down the line, far outweigh that initial expense. This is especially true for enterprise-level companies that won’t be able to access academia or governmental contracts without being compliant.</p>
<p>So early-stage companies, integrate accessibility principles into your product development and gather user data to constantly reinforce those principles. Sharing data across your onboarding, sales and design teams will give you a more complete picture of where your users are experiencing difficulties. Later-stage companies should carry out a self-assessment to determine where those principles are lacking in their product, and harness historical data and new user feedback to generate a fix.</p>
<p>An overhaul of AI and data isn’t just about adapting businesses’ framework. We still need the people at the helm to be more diverse. The fields remain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/16/artificial-intelligence-lack-diversity-new-york-university-study">overwhelmingly male and white</a>, and in tech, there are numerous <a href="https://medium.com/tech-disability-project/the-gift-of-grey-spaces-in-our-careers-bc01b925eb34">firsthand accounts</a> of exclusion and <a href="https://medium.com/tech-disability-project/my-own-worst-enemy-is-the-heckler-in-my-mind-ea5f622e3164">bias</a> toward people with disabilities. Until the teams curating data tools are themselves more diverse, nations&#8217; growth will continue to be stifled, and people with disabilities will be some of the hardest-hit casualties.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Robotic process automation unicorn UiPath is set to go public this week, concentrating our focus on its value.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation unicorn UiPath is set to go public this week, concentrating our focus on its value.</p>
<p>The well-known company was last valued on the private markets at $35 billion in February when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">closed a $750 million round</a>. Living up to that price as a public company, however, at least when it comes to its formal IPO price, is proving to be challenging.</p>
<p>In a sense, that&#8217;s not too surprising given that the red-hot IPO market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">cooled as Q1 2021 came to a close</a>. UiPath raised its last private round when the markets were most interested in public offerings and is now going public in a slightly altered climate.</p>
<p>In numerical terms, UiPath <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521120347/d98556ds1a.htm">raised its IPO range</a> from $43 to $50 per share, to $52 to $54 per share. That&#8217;s a 21% jump in the value of the lower end of its range, and an 8% gain to the value of the upper end of its per-share IPO price interval.</p>
<p>UiPath is also selling more shares than before, which should make its total valuation slightly larger at the top end than a mere 8% gain. So let&#8217;s go through the math one more time. Afterward, we&#8217;ll stack its new simple, fully diluted IPO valuations against its final private price, ask ourselves if our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">musings on the company&#8217;s recent profitability bore out</a>, and close by asking where the company might finally price, and if we expect it to do so above its new price range.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a strange few years for Fitbit. After defining the fitness tracking space, the company was a bit late to the smartwatch trend, but was still able to ride that wave to a rebound. But while watches have received most of the press the now Google-owned company has garnered in recent years, bands still comprise a substantial part of its business.</p>
<p>Today Fitbit announced the arrival of the Luxe. It’s a weird product. There’s certainly a market for it, but it’s hard to say how much of a niche were talking about here. The company called its target demo, “a unique set of buyers whose needs weren’t being met.” Specifically, the product is a “fashioned-forward” tracker for people looking for something a bit nicer than a plastic band to wear out and about.</p>
<p>Frankly, it’s hard not to see some reflections of Misfit’s take on the category. Perhaps the Fossil-owned company was ahead of its time. At $149, the device is priced between the Charge and the Versa, but decidedly closer to the former. That is to say, it’s pricey in the grand scheme of fitness trackers, but more or less in line with other Fitbit products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZjk79ZsuqQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It is, indeed, a nice-looking tracker, as far of these things go, featuring a color touchscreen surrounded by a stainless steel case. That’s coupled with a broad range of accessories, ranging from leather to gold-colored stainless steel.</p>
<p>Here’s Fitbit co-founder and GM (under Google) James Park:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past year, we’ve had to think differently about our health – from keeping an eye out for possible COVID-19 symptoms to managing the ongoing stress and anxiety of today’s world. Even though we are starting to see positive changes, it has never been more important to manage your holistic health. That’s why we’ve been resolute in introducing products to support you in staying mentally well and physically active. We’ve made major technological advancements with Luxe, creating a smaller, slimmer, beautifully designed tracker packed with advanced features – some that were previously only available with our smartwatches – making these tools accessible to even more people around the globe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly physical and mental health have been top of mind over the past year, even as step counts have dramatically plummeted. The device sports the usual array of Fitbit sensors, tracking activity, sleep and stress. It also works with a number of different mindfulness/meditation apps, including the company’s recently announced partnership with Deepak Chopra.</p>
<p>The band is up for preorder starting today and starts shipping in the spring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is deepening its relationship with music company Spotify and will allow users to listen to music hosted on Spotify while browsing through its apps as part of a new initiative called &#8220;Project Boombox,&#8221; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Monday.</p>
<p>Facebook is building an in-line audio player that will allow users to listen to songs or playlists being shared on the platforms without being externally linked to Spotify&#8217;s app or website. Zuckerberg highlighted the feature as another product designed to improve the experience of creators on its platforms, specifically the ability of musicians to share their work, &#8220;basically making audio a first-class type of media,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>We understand from sources familiar with the Spotify integration that this player will support both music and podcasts. It has already been tested in non-U.S. markets, including Mexico and Thailand, and it’s expected to arrive in about a week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The news was revealed in a wide-ranging interview with reporter Casey Newton on the company&#8217;s future pursuits in the audio world as Facebook aims to keep pace with upstart efforts like Clubhouse and increased activity in the podcasting world. </span></p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;We think that audio is going to be a first-class medium and that there are all these different products to be built across this whole spectrum,&#8221; said Zuckerberg. &#8220;Of course, it includes some areas that, that have been, you know, popular recently like podcasting and kind of live audio rooms like this, but I also think that there&#8217;s some interesting things that are under-explored in the area overall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify has already supported a fairly productive relationship with the Facebook and Instagram platforms. In recent years the music and podcasts platform has been integrated more deeply into Instagram Stories where users can share content from the service, a feature that&#8217;s also been available in Facebook Stories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today officially announced a suite of new audio products &#8212; an indication that it&#8217;s taking the threat from Clubhouse and other audio platforms more seriously. The company is doing more than just building its own take on Clubhouse, however, it&#8217;s also announcing tools that allow podcast creators to share long-form audio, a new Spotify integration for music and a brand-new short-form experience called Soundbites.</p>
<p>The Clubhouse clone was probably the most-discussed of the new products ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, given the increased interest in the audio networking market.</p>
<p>Like Clubhouse, the Facebook experience will also involve live audio rooms, where users can engage in topical discussions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think the areas where I&#8217;m most excited about it on Facebook are basically in the large number of communities and groups that exist. I think that you already have these communities that are organized around interests, and allowing people to come together and have rooms where they can talk is &#8212; I think it&#8217;d be a very useful thing,&#8221; said Zuckerberg, in a friendly interview with <a href="https://www.platformer.news/subscribe">Platformer</a>, timed alongside the official announcement. &#8220;When we launched video rooms earlier last year, groups and communities were one of the bigger areas where that took off. So, I think around audio, just given how much more accessible it is, that&#8217;ll be a pretty exciting area as well.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140522" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140522" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140522" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Live-Audio-Rooms-Rooms-Discovery-Stars-and-Fundraising-Side-by-Side.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140522" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>The Live Audio Rooms will be available across both Facebook and Messenger, Facebook says in an official <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The company will first test Live Audio Rooms in Groups, reaching Groups&#8217; 1.8 billion monthly users. They&#8217;ll also be made available to public figures and experts. Early adopters of the feature will include American football quarterback <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DangerRussWilson">Russell Wilson</a>, Grammy-nominated electronic music artist <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tokimonsta">TOKiMONSTA</a>, artist and director <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ellemoxleyofficial/">Elle Moxley</a> and five-time Olympic medalist and entrepreneur <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NastiaLiukin">Nastia Liukin</a>, Facebook says.</p>

<p>Live Audio Rooms will be available to everyone on Facebook this summer. Also this summer, Live Audio Rooms will be made available on Messenger, for an experience that allows friends to hang out, too.</p>
<p>In addition to products that rehash audio functionality available in tech products from other companies, Zuckerberg also revealed that the company was working on an audio-only version of its TikTok competitor Instagram Reels that allows users to quickly move through algorithmically sorted short audio clips, a project being called Soundbites. In its blog post, Facebook detailed that they will be testing Soundbites over the next few months with a small group of creators before making it widely available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140521" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140521" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140521" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Soundbites-Audio-Creation-Tool-and-Listening-Side-by-Side.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140521" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The idea here is it&#8217;s short-form audio clips, whether it&#8217;s people sharing things that they find funny… or kind of pithy things that people want to share that cover a bunch of different genres and topics,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>For podcast creators, Zuckerberg said the company will build out tools for those who follow podcasts and creators through Facebook Pages, but don&#8217;t currently have a way to access podcast content via the social network. He noted that there are now 170 million Facebook users who are connected to a Page for a podcast, which is why it wants to ensure they have a way to access this audio content more easily.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140520" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140520" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140520" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Podcasts-Listening.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140520" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>For these users, they&#8217;ll be able to discover the audio and start playing it, even in the background. Or they could choose to launch a second app to continue to play it, Zuckerberg said. We understand that the experience will actually allow users to directly open Spotify, if they would prefer to listen to the music or audio there, instead.</p>
<p>The feature will also help users with new podcast discovery based on your interests, and users will be able to comment on podcasts and recommend them to friends.</p>
<p>Related to these audio efforts, Zuckerberg referenced Facebook&#8217;s partnership with Spotify, which is now being expanded with something it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project/">internally referred to as &#8220;Project Boombox&#8221;</a> &#8212; an integration that would allow people to share content from their favorite artists, playlists and other types of audio in their feed. That content would then appear in a little, in-line player for others to click and play.</p>
<p>We understand from sources familiar with the Spotify integration that this player will support both music and podcasts. It has already been tested in non-U.S. markets, including Mexico and Thailand. It&#8217;s expected to arrive in about a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook’s interest in audio is further validation of the category and reinforces what we’ve known all along — the power and potential for audio is limitless,&#8221; a spokesperson for Spotify told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our ambition has always been to make Spotify ubiquitous across platforms and devices — bringing music and podcasts to more people — and our new integration with Facebook is another step in these efforts. We look forward to a continued partnership with Facebook, fueling audio discovery around the world,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg also referenced the need to serve the growing creator economy with its new products.</p>
<p>With Live Audio Rooms, fans will be able to support creators through Stars, Facebook&#8217;s existing in-app tipping feature, or donate to causes. Facebook says it will later offer other monetization tools like access to Live Audio Rooms on subscriptions. There&#8217;s also an Audio Creator Fund being made available to kick off the launch of Soundbites.</p>

<p>The exec also spoke about Facebook&#8217;s plans for a newsletter product, all under the umbrella of serving the creator community with a suite of tools &#8212; something Twitter is now doing, too, with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/"> its plans for Super Follow.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I think a product where a journalist or a creator can basically create a subscription for people who want to follow them, that spans both a newsletter and a podcast, is going to be a really powerful thing,&#8221; said Zuckerberg. &#8220;So that&#8217;s a big part of what we&#8217;re going to enable with some of the monetization tools around podcasts. That dovetails with the work that we&#8217;re planning to do&#8230;our work on our newsletters and giving tools for for independent journalists. I think enabling both of those things to come together on extremely favorable terms to journalists and creators, will be a pretty powerful thing,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>The product launches, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/4/18/22390742/facebook-podcasts-clubhouse-audio-launch-spotify-zuckerberg-apple">Vox scooped</a> on Sunday, indicate how seriously Facebook considers the disruption to its dominance that could be attributed to the growing number of places where fans connect with creators. The threat for Facebook today is not just a new app like Clubhouse or Substack&#8217;s newsletters or even Patreon, but the fact that the creator economy, in general, isn&#8217;t being centralized and owned by Facebook itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Geico, the second-largest auto insurer in the U.S., has fixed a security bug that let fraudsters steal customers&#8217; driver&#8217;s license numbers from its website.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20618953-geico-data-breach-notice">a data breach notice</a> filed with the California attorney general&#8217;s office, Geico said information gathered from other sources was used to &#8220;obtain unauthorized access to your driver’s license number through the online sales system on our website.&#8221;</p>
<p>The insurance giant did not say how many customers were affected by the breach but said the fraudsters accessed customer driver&#8217;s license numbers between January 21 and March 1. Companies are required to alert the state&#8217;s attorney general&#8217;s office when more than 500 state residents are affected by a security incident.</p>
<p>Geico said it had &#8220;reason to believe that this information could be used to fraudulently apply for unemployment benefits in your name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many financially driven criminals target government agencies using stolen identities or data. But many U.S. states require a government ID — like a driver&#8217;s license — to file for unemployment benefits. To get a driver&#8217;s license number, fraudsters take public or previously breached data and exploit weaknesses in auto insurance websites to obtain a customer&#8217;s driver&#8217;s license number. That allows the fraudsters to obtain unemployment benefits in another person&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, San Francisco-based insurance startup Metromile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/metromile-website-bug-hacker/">admitted a bug on its website</a> was used to obtain driver&#8217;s license numbers for six months before the bug was fixed in January.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve received correspondence from your state government and haven&#8217;t filed for unemployment benefits, there&#8217;s a good chance your personal data may have been used fraudulently.</p>
<p>Geico spokesperson Christine Tasher did not return multiple requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capital is a networks business — from networks of founders to the web of investors and angels and gossamer threads of potential customers, talent and service providers. The density of those networks determines success: Find just the right person to fit a role or a slot on a cap table, and a startup might just get a bit more lift.</p>
<p>It’s a topic that Casey Caruso has thought a lot about. In a research project at Stanford, she looked at a slightly different form of network density: <a href="http://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_fall_2020/reports/55791766.pdf">using convolution neural network (CNN) models to evaluate investment decisions</a>, working with a group of three other authors to analyze how to optimize VC using algorithms. It’s a crossover point she’s familiar with, building upon a technical background and an engineering role at Google while also part-time investing with Bessemer.</p>
<p>While at a dinner at San Francisco’s northern Italian restaurant SPQR in Lower Pac Heights, she talked about investing with friends Lauren Stephanian, now a principal at blockchain-focused Pantera Capital, and Terri Burns, a partner at GV. They realized that much like how all roads lead to Rome, all three were on paths heading for the same direction: using technology to improve venture decision-making. “We are all computer scientists by training,” Caruso said. “Because of that fundamental training, we all approach problems pretty pragmatically.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The three began collaborating outside of their day jobs on how to integrate AI better into the earliest stages of venture, identifying features from models while also being open to the qualitative nature of the business. Then, they decided to more formally build a compact around investing in 2019, creating <a href="https://tlccollective.space">TLC Collective</a> (their combined initials) as a base to invest from.</p>
<p>Investing using their own combined capital, TLC writes angel and pre-seed checks into companies built by technical founders. So far, the group has invested in 11 companies, including data discovery platform <a href="https://selectstar.com">Select Star</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/select-star-raises-seed-to-automatically-document-datasets-for-data-scientists/">which I profiled a couple of weeks ago</a>), audio breakout app <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a>, biology data platform <a href="https://watershed.ai">Watershed</a>, remote work manager <a href="https://friday.app">Friday</a>, cryptocurrency risk compliance platform <a href="https://trmlabs.com">TRM</a>, user infra platform <a href="https://stytch.com/">Stytch</a>, and a variety of others.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nb91l5oyTr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/select-star-raises-seed-to-automatically-document-datasets-for-data-scientists/">Select Star raises seed to automatically document datasets for data scientists</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Select Star raises seed to automatically document datasets for data scientists&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/select-star-raises-seed-to-automatically-document-datasets-for-data-scientists/embed/#?secret=nb91l5oyTr" data-secret="nb91l5oyTr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While their investments span sectors, the thread holding them all together is the technical chops of the founders. “We invest in very technical teams because we are very technical and that is our first qualifier,” Caruso said. Stephanian meanwhile emphasized that while technical talent is a key benchmark, the trio can diverge on areas of focus. “Despite having a similar background, we all have different interests and skillsets,” she said. They noted that Burns focuses on consumer, Stephanian on fintech, enterprise and crypto, and Caruso on frontier tech.</p>
<p>So far, the group remains a “side gig” for the three, and they are continuing to iterate on their underlying algorithm. “We go back and forth between using the actual algorithm versus just using it as a framework or reference,” Caruso explained. “We are finding a balance between the art and the science by applying our programming background.”</p>
<p>The collective’s pace has been roughly an investment per quarter, a bandwidth that the group said they are likely to continue for the time being. They continue to invest their own capital, and they don’t feel pressure to expand into new models like rolling funds or crowdfunding — at least, not yet. “We haven’t even considered doing a rolling fund,” Caruso said, although noted that <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/angels">the group is part of On Deck Angels</a>. Stephanian said that the competition today in that space is keen. “I have gotten so many messages from people who are raising their own syndicates,” she said.</p>
<p>The firm’s checks range from the tens of thousands to the hundreds of thousands of dollars per investment.</p>
<p>Like the networks powering their AI models and the networks they are building among their founders, TLC Collective has built a triangle of connections amidst its investors. As those connections expand out, the hope for the group is that they are able to expand the data to optimize their models while also investing in the best technical founders growing new businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The era of cloud gaming hasn&#8217;t arrived with the intensity that may have seemed imminent a couple years ago when major tech platforms announced their plays. In 2021, the market is still pretty much nonexistent despite established presences from nearly all of tech&#8217;s biggest players.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been slow to roll out its Xbox Cloud Gaming beta to its users widely across platforms, but that&#8217;s likely because they know that, unlike other upstart platforms, there&#8217;s not a huge advantage to them rushing out the gate first. This week, the company will begin rolling out the service on iOS and PC to Game Pass Ultimate users, sending out invites to a limited number of users and scaling it up over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The limited beta is our time to test and learn; we’ll send out more invites on a continuous basis to players in all 22 supported countries, evaluate feedback, continue to improve the experience, and add support for more devices,&#8221; wrote Xbox&#8217;s Catherine Gluckstein in a<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/19/xbox-cloud-gaming-windows-pc-and-apple-limited-beta/"> blog post</a>. &#8220;Our plan is to iterate quickly and open up to all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members in the coming months so more people have the opportunity to play Xbox in all-new ways.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The service has been available in beta for Android users since last year but it&#8217;s been a slow expansion to other platforms outside that world.</p>
<p>A big part of that slowdown has been the result of Apple playing hardball with cloud gaming platform providers, whose business models represent a major threat to App Store gaming revenues. Apple announced a carve-out provision for cloud-gaming platforms that would maintain dependency on the App Store and in-app purchase frameworks but none of the providers seemed very happy with Apple&#8217;s solution. As a result, Xbox Cloud Gaming will operate entirely through the web on iOS inside mobile Safari.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration is opening an investigation into a crash involving a Tesla that authorities say was operating with no one behind the wheel, which left two men dead on late Saturday evening outside of Houston.</p>
<p>The 2019 Tesla Model S went off the road after it failed to negotiate a slight curve, <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647">local CBS-affiliate KHOU-TV reported</a>. Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman told local reporters that the accident was unprecedented.</p>
<p>“Our office has never experienced a crash scene like this,” he said. “Normally, when the fire dept arrives, they have a vehicle fire under control in minutes, but this went on for close to four hours.” The long burn time was reportedly due to the electric vehicle batteries repeatedly reigniting.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 gallons of water were used to put out the fire. One of the victims was in the front passenger seat and the other was in the backseat, “and at the time of the accident there was no one in the [driver’s] seat,” Herman said.</p>
<p>Earlier on the day of the crash, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1383548841438236674">retweeted news</a> that the company released its first-quarter 2021 safety report. “Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle,” he said. Tesla describes its Autopilot as a “suite of driver assistance features” and states that it requires “active driver supervision.”</p>
<p>“NHTSA is aware of the tragic crash involving a Tesla vehicle outside of Houston, Texas,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. “NHTSA has immediately launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash. We are actively engaged with local law enforcement and Tesla to learn more about the details of the crash and will take appropriate steps when we have more information.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Tesla for comment and will update the story if the company responds.</p>
