										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://aero.com/na">Aero</a>, a startup backed by Garrett Camp&#8217;s startup studio Expa, has raised $20 million in Series A funding — right as CEO Uma Subramanian said demand for air travel is returning &#8220;with a vengeance.&#8221;</p>
<p>I last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/expa-backed-aero-is-a-premium-air-travel-startup-with-16m-in-funding/">wrote about Aero in 2019</a>, when it announced Subramanian&#8217;s appointment as CEO, along with the fact that it had raised a total of $16 million in funding. Subramanian told me that after the announcement, the startup (which had already run test flights between Mykonos and Ibiza) spent the next few months buying and retrofitting planes, with plans for a summer 2020 launch.</p>
<p>Obviously, the pandemic threw a wrench into those plans, but a smaller wrench than you might think. Subramanian said that as borders re-opened and travel resumed in a limited capacity, Aero began to offer flights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We had a great summer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We sold a lot of seats, and we were <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/04/042804.asp#gross-profit-margin">gross margin positive</a> in July and August.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vhwmUNVKI8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/expa-backed-aero-is-a-premium-air-travel-startup-with-16m-in-funding/">Backed by Expa, Aero is a premium air travel startup with $16M in funding</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Backed by Expa, Aero is a premium air travel startup with $16M in funding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/expa-backed-aero-is-a-premium-air-travel-startup-with-16m-in-funding/embed/#?secret=vhwmUNVKI8" data-secret="vhwmUNVKI8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup describes its offering as &#8220;semi-private&#8221; air travel — you fly out of private terminals, on small and spacious planes (Subramanian said the company has taken vehicles with 37 seats and retrofitted them to hold only 16), with a personalized, first-class experience delivered by its concierge team. Aero currently offers a single route between Los Angeles and Aspen, with one-way tickets costing $1,250.</p>
<p>Subramanian was previously CEO of Airbus&#8217; helicopter service Voom, and she said she approached the company &#8220;very skeptically,&#8221; since the conventional wisdom in the aviation industry is that the business is all about &#8220;putting as many people into a finite amount of square footage&#8221; as possible. But she claimed that early demand showed her that &#8220;the thesis is real.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a set of people who want this,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Air travel used to be aspirational, something people got dressed up for. We want to bring back the magical part of the travel experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, if you&#8217;re the kind of &#8220;premium traveler&#8221; who might already spend &#8220;thousands of dollars a night&#8221; on a vacation in Amangiri, Utah, it seems a little silly to be &#8220;spending hours trying to find the a low-cost flight out of Salt Lake City.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120973" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120973" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2120973" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?w=680" alt="Aero interior" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TribeX-Aero-12.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120973" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aero</p></div></p>
<p>Subramanian suggested that while demand for business travel may be slow to return (it sounds like she enjoyed the ability to fundraise without getting on a plane), the demand for leisure travel is already back, and will only grow as the pandemic ends. Plus, the steps that Aero took to create a luxury experience also meant that it&#8217;s well-suited for social distancing.</p>
<p>Speaking of fundraising, the Series A was led by Keyframe Capital, with Keyframe&#8217;s chief investment officer John Rapaport joining the Aero board. Cyrus Capital Partners and Expa also participated.</p>
<p>The new funding will allow Aero to grow its team and to add more flights, Subramanian said. Next up is a route between Los Angeles and Cabo San Lucas scheduled to launch in April, and she added that the company will be returning to Europe this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a horrendous time to be Lufthansa, but counterintuitively, it&#8217;s best time to start something from scratch,&#8221; she said — in large part because it&#8217;s been incredibly affordable to buy planes and other assets.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What investors will be willing to pay for ThredUp is going to be very interesting. A bit like Oscar Health, it's a hard company to price. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another day, another venture-backed IPO filing. Today it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thredup.com/">ThredUp</a>, a used-goods marketplace that is approaching the public markets in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/poshmark-prices-ipo-above-range-as-public-markets-continue-to-yolo-startups/">Poshmark&#8217;s own strong debut</a>.</p>
<p>Both companies have a related market focus, albeit different approaches to selling used goods. Poshmark allows users to sell clothing items through its app. ThredUp, in contrast, acquires goods from users and sells them itself.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But while Poshmark had profits to brag about in its own IPO filing, ThredUp does not and is also growing more slowly, expanding revenues just 13.6% in 2020. Reading <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1484778/000162828021003857/thredups-1.htm">its S-1 filing</a>, it&#8217;s clear ThredUp did not have the best 2020, thanks in part to COVID-19.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s get into the numbers posted by the company backed by Trinity Ventures, Redpoint, Highland Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs to decide if it&#8217;s just merely to catch Poshmark&#8217;s wave, or if its business is a fine machine in its own right.</p>
<h2>ThredUp&#8217;s model</h2>
<p>To understand ThredUp&#8217;s business, we have to get into the mechanics of how it sells things. The company has two methods: direct sales and consignment. In the former, ThredUp buys goods and sells them. It then &#8220;recognize[s] revenue on a gross basis&#8221; and generates gross profit after deducting &#8220;inventory cost, inbound shipping and inventory write-downs, as well as outbound shipping, outbound labor and packaging costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is the model that ThredUp is leaving behind. After shifting to &#8220;primarily consignment sales&#8221; in 2019, the company&#8217;s business has skewed sharply in that direction. Consignment works by having consumers send ThredUp their goods, which it holds, and perhaps sells, remitting to the user a portion of the sale price. The method reduces write-downs and boosts gross margins.</p>
<p>Consignment sales at ThredUp &#8220;recognize revenue net of seller payouts,&#8221; deducting &#8220;outbound shipping, outbound labor and packaging costs&#8221; to reach gross profit results.</p>
<p>The revenue-mix focus change can be seen in how ThredUp generated gross profit in 2018, 2019 and 2020. In those years, consignment gross profit came to 38%, 67% and 81% of total gross profit. ThredUp&#8217;s business today is effectively a large, digital consignment effort.</p>
<p>What impact has that shift had on the company&#8217;s financial health? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>ThredUp&#8217;s growth</h2>
<p>ThredUp posted $129.6 million in 2018 revenue, a figure that grew to $163.8 million in 2019 and $186.0 million in 2020. The company&#8217;s growth slowed from 26.4% in 2019 to 13.6% in 2020, a sharp deceleration. But at the same time, the portion of ThredUp revenues that came from consignment sales grew to 74% from 60%. Did that change have a material impact on the company&#8217;s gross margins, thus rendering its slow growth more palatable?</p>
<p>Not really. The company&#8217;s gross margins came to 68.7% in 2019 and 68.9% in 2020. That&#8217;s about as flat as Texas. And notably the number stayed flat despite the company noting that consignment revenues had stronger gross margins in 2019 and 2020 (77% and 75%, respectively) than its other model (57% and 51%, respectively).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People are not only shopping digitally more than ever. They’re also shopping using their mobile phones more than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for mobile-first companies like </span><a href="http://snapcommerce.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcommerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this is good news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcommerce</span><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">formerly known as SnapTravel, has raised $85 million in what the company is describing as a “Pre-IPO” growth round to help further its mission of “changing the way people shop on their phones.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Toronto, Ontario-based startup has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built out an AI-driven, vertical-agnostic platform that uses messaging in an effort to personalize the mobile shopping experience and “deliver the best promotional prices.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it was initially focused on the travel industry, the company is now branching out into other consumer verticals – hence its name change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inovia Capital and Lion Capital co-led the new growth round, which included participation from Acrew DCF, Thayer Ventures, Full In Partners as well as existing backers Telstra Ventures and Bee Partners. The financing brings Snapcommerce’s total raised since its 2016 inception to over $100 million. Its last raise &#8212; a $7.2 million round from Telstra and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/01/startups-net-more-than-capital-with-nba-players-as-investors/?pix=451_0_0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBA star Steph Curry </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212; took place in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup was founded by tech entrepreneurs </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/hussein-fazal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hussein Fazal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whose prior company AdParlor grew to $100+ million in revenue,</span><a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2011/11/01/adknowledge-acquires-facebook-ad-management-platform-adparlor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then sold to AdKnowledge back in 2011</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/henry-shi#/entity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Shi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who previously built </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/umentioned/people"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uMentioned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and worked at Google, where he helped launch YouTube Music Insights, according to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/24/snaptravel-raises-8-million-for-a-hotel-booking-service-that-works-over-chat/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous TechCrunch reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120816" style="width: 653px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120816" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120816" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog_hero_new.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="643" height="345" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog_hero_new.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog_hero_new.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog_hero_new.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog_hero_new.jpg?resize=768,411 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog_hero_new.jpg?resize=680,364 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog_hero_new.jpg?resize=1536,823 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog_hero_new.jpg?resize=2048,1097 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog_hero_new.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120816" class="wp-caption-text">Snapcommerce co-founders Henry Shi and Hussein Fazal, Image courtesy of Snapcommerce</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcommerce launched its first, travel-focused product in 2017. It works by using </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chatbots to interact with customers via messaging apps such as SMS, Facebook and Whatsapp. But the company also has human agents ready to help if people need more assistance, in the past essentially serving as on-demand travel agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its service is not just for hotels and flights, but also to help people book restaurants and activities too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus has been on building that personal relationship,” Fazal said. “Many people end up coming back to us when they travel again.” In fact, over 40% of its sales in 2020 came from repeat customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the company claims to have helped more than 10 million users globally save over $75 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It expects to cross over $1 billion in total mobile sales this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now it’s ready to branch out into helping consumers save money on goods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When shopping, it’s hard to find the right product and even if you do, it’s hard to find a good deal,” he said. “On a desktop, there’s ways around it. But on mobile, it’s virtually impossible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company turned the corner to profitability three months into the pandemic in 2020, seeing a 60% spike in sales in the second half of the year compared to H2 2019, according to CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fazal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It then decided to re-invest its profits to continue growing the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The profitability during the pandemic gave us confidence that we could turn to profitability whenever we needed to and gave us control of our own destiny, which enabled this fundraise,” Fazal told TechCrunch. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third quarter of 2020 ended up being our greatest quarter ever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic, naturally, only accelerated its growth as more consumers turned to mobile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe the next wave of power purchasers will be via mobile,” Fazal said. “Some of the new generation don’t even have desktops or laptops, and they spend all their time on their mobile phone and messaging. So we’re able to be at the forefront.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcommerce has an IPO in its sights although no specific timeline. The company did not reveal its current valuation or hard revenue figures.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The company makes money by either marking up prices provided by a merchant or charging the merchant a commission.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.inovia.vc/people/chris-arsenault"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Arsenault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, partner at Inovia and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapcommerce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lead investor, said his firm “tripled up” on its investment in the startup after witnessing its success in the travel space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Other companies out there only care about the transaction, and force consumers to look through several services to see if they got the best price, all the while telling them ‘there’s only 2 seats left,’ ” he told TechCrunch. “We believe that consumers aren’t going to accept that type of pressure-selling in the future. And Snapcommerce’s ability to build trust with its customers and service providers has attracted us to them as they are defining what the future of commerce is going to be like.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote working &#8212; hiring people further afield and letting people work outside of a central physical office &#8212; is looking like it will be here to stay, and today one of the startups building tools for that environment is announcing a big fundraise in response to the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://papayaglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Papaya Global</a>, an Israeli startup that provides cloud-based payroll and hiring, onboarding and compliance services across 140 countries for organizations that employ full-time, part-time, and contract workers outside of their home country, has picked up $100 million in funding and has confirmed that its valuation is now over $1 billion.</p>
<p>The company targets organizations that not only have global workforces, but are expanding their employee bases quickly. They include fast-growing startups like OneTrust, nCino and Hopin (which today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a monster $400 million round</a>), as well as major corporates like Toyota, Microsoft, Wix and General Dynamics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Papaya is not disclosing revenue numbers but said that sales have grown 300% year-over-year for each of the last three years.</p>
<p>Led by GreenOaks Capital Partners, this Series C also includes significant participation from IVP Ventures and Alkeon Capital. Previous backers Insight Venture Partners, Scale Venture Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, Dynamic Loop, New Era and Workday Ventures, Access Ventures and Group 11 also chipped in. The new investment brings Papaya’s total funding to $190 million.</p>
<p>Papaya has been on a fundraising tear in the last 18 months. Today&#8217;s news comes less than six months after it raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/papaya-global-raises-40m-for-a-payroll-and-hr-platform-aimed-at-global-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 million Series B</a>. And that round came less than a year after a $45 million Series A.</p>
<p>Why so much, so quickly? Partly because of the demands on the business, but possibly also to capitalize on an opportunity at a time when so many others are also going after it as well.</p>
<p>The opportunity is that companies and other organizations are finding themselves needing tools to address the current state of play: workforce growth today doesn&#8217;t look like it did in 2019, and so incumbent solutions like ADP, or cobbled together solutions covering multiple geographies, either don&#8217;t cut it, or are too costly to maintain.</p>
<p>Papaya Global, in contrast, says it has built an AI-based platform that automates a lot of work and removes much of the manual activity comes out of trying to right-size a lot of legacy payroll products to work in new paradigms.</p>
<p>“The major impact of COVID-19 for us has been changing attitudes,” CEO Eynat Guez, who co-founded the company with Ruben Drong and Ofer Herman, told me in an interview last September. &#8220;People usually think that payroll works by itself, but it’s one of the more complex parts of the organization, covering major areas like labor, accounting, tax. Eight months ago, a lot of clients thought, it just happens. But now they realize they didn’t have control of the data, some don’t even have a handle on who is being paid.”</p>
<p>One challenge, however, is that many others are also chasing these customers in hopes of becoming the ADP of distributed and global work.</p>
<p>Last month, a startup called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/oyster-snaps-up-20m-for-its-hr-platform-aimed-at-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oyster</a>, also aimed at distributed workforces, raised $20 million. Others in the same area that have raised lots of capital include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/turing-nabs-32m-more-for-an-ai-based-platform-to-source-and-manage-engineers-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing</a>,  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/deel-nabs-30m-more-for-payroll-compliance-and-other-tools-to-run-global-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deel</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/remote-raises-35m-to-help-orgs-with-global-workforce-payroll-benefits-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hibob-raises-70m-on-a-500m-valuation-for-its-new-take-on-hr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hibob</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Personio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/factorial-raises-16m-to-take-on-the-hr-world-with-a-platform-for-smbs/">Factorial</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lattice</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/turing-nabs-32m-more-for-an-ai-based-platform-to-source-and-manage-engineers-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/rippling-nabs-145m-at-a-1-35b-valuation-to-build-out-its-all-in-one-platform-for-employee-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rippling</a>.</p>
<p>And as we have pointed out before, these are just some of the HR startups that have raised money in the last year. There are many, many more.</p>
<p>Investors here are hoping that as we see some consolidation emerge out of this mix, there will be a few leaders and that Papaya will be one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Papaya Global has built a best in class solution to onboard new employees, automate payroll, and manage a global workforce through a single pane of glass. Both growing and established companies have dramatically changed their working practices in recent years, and Papaya has seen impressive growth as a result. We’re excited to continue supporting them as they seek to simplify an increasingly complex challenge for some of the world’s biggest companies,&#8221; said Patrick Backhouse, Partner at Greenoaks Capital, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m excited for any opportunity to talk about soft robotics. There’s something other-worldly about the world of inflatable robotic bladders. Human beings are wont to develop robotics in their own image. The world of soft robots are something akin to what the technology would be like if it was developed by a sea creature.</p>
<p>Certainly cephalopods like octopi and squid have been a major inspiration for the category, along with other invertebrates. The benefits of the technology is clear. These far less rigid structures are more compliant and are able to squeeze into more places and conform to different shapes. We have seen a number of models deployed for different tasks, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/mit-researchers-develop-a-much-better-way-to-optimize-the-control-of-soft-robots/">picking and placing fragile products</a> like foodstuffs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120376" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120376" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2120376" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Adjustable-Robots-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120376" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MIT CSAIL</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another major benefit is the safety. As human-robot collaborations increase, companies are looking for ways to ensure that their big, hulking machines don’t accidentally hurt their workers. That appears to be a big part of the inspiration behind<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/cables-could-help-soft-robots-transform-into-harder-structures/"> this MIT project</a> designed to create robots that can alternate between hard and soft structures.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="88tZSoUHZv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/cables-could-help-soft-robots-transform-into-harder-structures/">Cables could help soft robots transform into harder structures</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It’s still very much in the early stages, but the research presents a compelling idea, with a series of cables that help the soft structure become more rigid. The team likens the tech to the muscles in a human arm. When flexed, it becomes much more difficult to move.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/v8k7HVkIqCQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>New research published by researchers at National University of Singapore and the University of Lincoln (U.K.) in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03153-z">the journal Nature</a> show ocean-inspired soft robots in a seemingly more natural environment: the Marina Trench. The soft structure (this time drawing more direct inspiration from rays) was able to withstand the extreme pressure that comes with being nearly 11,000 meters below the surface of the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Per the team:</p>
<blockquote><p>This self-powered robot eliminates the requirement for any rigid vessel. To reduce shear stress at the interfaces between electronic components, we decentralize the electronics by increasing the distance between components or separating them from the printed circuit board.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YPw9FpyULy0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Another entirely different &#8212; but equally fascinating &#8212; swimming robot comes out of UC San Diego. The 2 cm long fish-shaped robots have platinum tales, which propel through bubbles created by a reaction to the hydrogen peroxide in their petri dishes. After researchers cut the little robots in half or thirds, magnetic interaction makes the pieces “heal” back together. The hope is that such application could be put to use in larger swimming robots, which are frequently made of fragile material.</p>

<p>The big robotics investment of the week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/28/autonomous-drone-maker-skydio-raises-170m-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/"> is Skydio</a>. Not the first time that sentiment has been uttered, of course. The Series D brings the drone makers total funding up to $340 million, as it expands to additional commercial applications. There’s also the fact that the company is U.S.-based, which likely makes it all the more appealing to investors following DJI’s addition to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-commerce-department-entity-list/">DoC’s “entity list” in December.</a></p>

<p>That was one of those initiatives the Trump administration took on its way out the door. Like a number of recent entity list additions, this will hopefully be scrutinized under the new administration. Thus far, however, it hasn’t appeared to impact DJI’s ability to sell drones in the States, including the new FPV.</p>

<p>I got my hands on the new model this week. It’s an interesting new category the drone giant has only dipped its toes in thus far. The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/dji-launches-an-all-in-one-fpv-drone-system/"> DJI FPV</a> bundles goggles for a first-person flight experience that has largely been the domain of racers and high-end hobbyist models. Given that DJI current controls roughly 70% of the global market, this marks an important moment for the burgeoning category.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119802" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119802" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119802" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skyty-1.gif" alt="Animated image of a drone floating over rebar and tying it together at intersections." width="700" height="394" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119802" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SkyMul</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/__trashed-12/">SkyMul</a>, meanwhile, is one of the more interesting applications I&#8217;ve seen in the drone space for a bit. The startup is one of a deluge of robotics companies in the construction space. Specially, it uses quadcopters for the extremely thankless job of tying rebar.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119637" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119637" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2119637" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MIT-Insect-Robot-01-PRESS_0.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119637" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MIT</p></div></p>
<p>On the research side of the category, we’ve got these <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/mits-insect-sized-drones-are-built-to-survive-collisions/">adorable little buggers</a> out of MIT. At 0.6 grams, they weigh roughly the size of a large bumble bee. And unlike previous models, these “cassette tapes with wings” are designed to survive mid-air collisions. Turns out bumble bees tend to crash into each other a bunch while flying. That’s one of those little pieces of nature trivia that make perfect sense when you think about it for a second.</p>

<p>The drones are “are built with soft actuators, made from carbon nanotube-coated rubber cylinders. The actuators elongate when electricity is applied at a rate up to 500 times a second. Doing this causes the wings to beat and the drones to take flight.”</p>
<p>After I posted that article, someone asked if I knew about a “kids&#8217; book about a boy who becomes an insect drone and solves mysteries?” I did not. But I asked the occasionally usual social media platform and it nearly instantly responded with the extremely 70s kids book title, &#8220;Danny Dunn, Invisible Boy.&#8221; The thirteenth book in a long-running series, the book offered a glimpse into the future of drones. Per a <a href="https://medium.com/message/the-politics-of-personal-drones-perfectly-predicted-in-a-ya-novel-from-1974-3c171601b82b">2014 Medium article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You control the drone using a keyboard box, a thoroughly funky virtual-reality helmet, and what look like a pair of souped up Nintendo Power Gloves. With head inside the helmet, the pilot sees what the dragonfly sees, and even feels what the dragonfly feels via haptic feedback in the gloves.</p></blockquote>
<p>In less fun “science fiction predicts the future” news, a follow up from all of the hubbub surrounding Boston Dynamics last week. Once again, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/robot-police-dogs-are-here-should-we-be-worried/">ACLU is weighing in on the matter</a>, as it did when the company debuted footage of a Spot unit in the field with the Massachusetts state PD on our stage a while back.</p>
<p>The org reiterates questions it and others have raised before, including some of the generally ominous images and ideas around weaponized robotics that have been floating around for a long time. Here, however, it combines these with existing conversations around policing, AI and bias:</p>
<blockquote><p>Viewed narrowly, there’s nothing wrong with using a robot to scout a dangerous location or deliver food to hostages. But communities should take a hard look at expensive, rare-use technologies at a time when the nation is increasingly recognizing the need to invest in solving our social problems in better ways than just empowering police.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot to untangle here, but as I said week, it’s a net positive that we’re discussing these things now, while they’re still largely hypothetical. If drones have taught us anything, it’s that technology comes at you fast. I can appreciate that last week’s art instillation was not the framing Boston Dynamics wanted to enter into this conversation &#8212; and I do think the company’s an easy target due to its profile and the framing of fiction like Black Mirror.</p>
<p>But having this ongoing conversation is a net positive for robotics, going forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh off the termination of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planned merger with Visa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Plaid announced Thursday a new income verification <a href="https://plaid.com/products/">product</a>, which it said is aimed at “improving the lending lifecycle” with payroll data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed simply Income, the new product &#8212; which is currently in beta &#8212; is designed to make it easier for people to verify their income in order to do things like secure loans, qualify for mortgages, rent apartments and lease cars, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaid Income gives lenders &#8212; both at fintech companies and financial institutions &#8212; verified and permissioned data on the income, employment status and tax liabilities of individual users.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based company says it has been developing its Payroll product suite for more than a year. Last month, Plaid launched its other product in that suite,</span> <a href="https://plaid.com/products/deposit-switch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deposit Switch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is designed to allow people to “q</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uickly” switch their direct deposits to a new or existing bank account by linking their payroll account via Plaid.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="apzW0iFybS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">Visa will not acquire Plaid after running into regulatory wall</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Visa will not acquire Plaid after running into regulatory wall&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/embed/#?secret=apzW0iFybS" data-secret="apzW0iFybS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Plaid opted to build out its own income verification offering rather than partner with another fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson told TechCrunch via email that the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is “always” looking to provide people with the most holistic view of their financial lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the past few years, we’ve added support for several additional different types of consumer-permissioned data, including liabilities, investments, mortgage data and more,” the spokesperson added. “It&#8217;s become clearer that payroll data has huge potential value for enabling new or more streamlined services that help people better manage their financial lives, and we knew we wanted to bring that to market ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, the process of providing information so that lenders can verify employment status, income and ability to pay can place a heavy burden on applicants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They often need to retrieve and then share multiple documents or PDFs, which then a lender must process and review,” Plaid points out. With Income, the process is streamlined, the fintech infrastructure provider claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Plaid <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/link/">Link</a>, applicants have the choice to share their payroll information using one of two methods:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authenticating using their employer or payroll provider account </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uploading payroll documents including paystubs, W2s and supported types of 1099s </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide a more “familiar and secure” experience for applicants, Plaid is developing credential-less authentication capabilities. This means that, say, an applicant for a credit card could supply key identifying information to the lender that Plaid would then use to locate his or her income information. Or maybe another bit of explanation of why this matt Also, an applicant will have the chance to review the information they are sharing and opt out of sharing it at any time.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/the-kate-adamson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kate Adamson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, product lead at Plaid, said the company views access to </span><a href="https://plaid.com/blog/payroll-data-access/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">payroll data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the next area of opportunity in financial services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The past decade of fintech innovation has shown that people can make better financial decisions more easily with better access to and control of their own financial data,” she told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The income verification space is an increasingly crowded one. Last June, TechCrunch wrote about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinwheel, an API layer for payroll data that handles everything from income and employee verification to easily switching and managing direct deposit. The company officially </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/pinwheel-is-the-api-platform-for-income-verification-that-every-fintech-and-neobank-needs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">came out of stealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, announcing that it had raised a $7 million seed round from Josh Kopelman at First Round Capital and Greg Bettinelli at Upfront Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also Argyle, which is building a “gateway to access employment records.” In October, that startup announced </span><a href="https://finledger.com/2020/10/15/argyle-raises-20-million-to-be-the-plaid-for-employment-records/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $20 million Series A funding round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Bain Capital Ventures. Ironically, Argyle’s name was inspired by Plaid, according to Argyle CEO and co-founder Shmulik Fishman. At the time, he told me that the company intentionally named Argyle after a pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a huge fan of Plaid, and make no secret about it,” Fishman had said. “Plus, there’s a number of other successful companies such as Stripe and Checkr named after patterns. We went through a list of patterns and polka dots didn’t sound very good. So we settled on Argyle. And ultimately, we want to be the Plaid for employment records.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en">Square</a>, a fintech company that serves both individuals and companies, announced that it has purchased a majority stake in Tidal, a music streaming service. The deal, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/business/media/tidal-square-jay-z-dorsey.html">worth some $297 million</a>, will Tidal allow artist-partners to keep their ownership in the music company.</p>
<p>Square CEO Jack Dorsey used his other company, Twitter, this morning to explain the deal. Dorsey seemed to expect the transaction to generate skepticism – which it definitely has. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460907958243328">opening message</a>, he asked a rhetorical question: <em>&#8220;Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Why indeed. Dorsey&#8217;s expectation is that his company can replicate the success of Cash App and other Square products in the world of music. Noting that &#8220;new ideas are found at the intersection,&#8221; Dorsey argued that the confluence of &#8220;music and the economy&#8221; is one such point of convergence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal also installs musician and businessperson Jay Z on Square&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Some early reaction to the deal has proved negative. It&#8217;s not hard to riff on the seeming-strangeness of Square and Tidal as a pair. And Square has made acquisitions in the past that appeared adjacent and failed to stick. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/04/its-official-square-acquires-food-delivery-service-caviar/">bought food-delivery service Caviar in 2014</a> before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/doordash-is-buying-caviar-from-square/">selling it to DoorDash in 2019</a>, for example; that Square appears to have made a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/square-sells-food-delivery-service-caviar-to-doordash-for-410-million.html">venture-level return on the transaction</a> is immaterial to the focus argument.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NJJwcjFw6j"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/plex-teams-with-tidal-to-bring-a-discounted-streaming-music-subscription-to-its-media-app/">Plex teams with TIDAL to bring a discounted streaming music subscription to its media app</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Plex teams with TIDAL to bring a discounted streaming music subscription to its media app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/plex-teams-with-tidal-to-bring-a-discounted-streaming-music-subscription-to-its-media-app/embed/#?secret=NJJwcjFw6j" data-secret="NJJwcjFw6j" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But the bull-case for the Square-Tidal tie-up is easy to make as well. The American fintech just spent a minute fraction of a <em>single</em> percent of its market capitalization on the smaller company, and through its choice to let artists keep their stake, has effectively onboarded a host of ambassadors for its brand.</p>
<p>And Dorsey is not wrong that Square did shake up the commerce game for many offline businesses with its original card reader. Why not take a swing at a part of the economy &#8212; music &#8212; that has migrated from the physical world to the digital in the past few years, much like small businesses in recent quarters?</p>
<p>Square&#8217;s business users, it&#8217;s &#8220;seller ecosystem,&#8221; as it likes to call it, are increasingly digital. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, &#8220;in-person only&#8221; usage is falling as a percentage of seller gross payment volume (GPV), while &#8220;online only&#8221; and &#8220;omnichannel&#8221; GPV are taking up the slack.</p>
<p>Square has a known win in its consumer-focused Cash App service, which <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/311240100/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/2020-Q4-Shareholder-Letter-Square.pdf">reached 36 million monthly actives</a> in December of 2020, up from 24 million in the same period one year prior. You can imagine tie-ups between the music company and the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/738576/user-base-of-leading-payment-apps-usa-age/">youth-skewing Cash App audience</a>. And having Jay Z at the Square boardroom table will hardly make the company less innovative; he may bring fresh perspective.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the question of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, a new form of digital asset that have recently become the cause célèbre of the cryptocurrency community. Given that Square has a growing cryptocurrency business via Cash App, and has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-23/square-reports-quarterly-revenue-that-falls-short-of-estimates">invested hundreds of millions of dollars into bitcoin itself</a>. If there is space in the market for Square to bring music-based NFTs to its larger consumer user base is an interesting question. If the answer is yes, Square could now be in a leading position to create that market.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Perhaps the Square-Tidal deal won&#8217;t generate the future growth that Square imagines. But the deal is cheap, snagging Jay Z as a leader is a win, and it&#8217;s hard to win by only playing corporate defense.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched another batch of its Starlink satellites – the usual complement of 60 of the low Earth orbit spacecraft, which will join the more than 1,000 already making up the existing constellation. This is the fifth launch of Starlink satellites for SpaceX this year, and the 20th overall.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, SpaceX opened up Starlink access to anyone in a current or planned service area via a pre-order reservation system with a refundable up-front deposit. The company aims to continue launches like this one apace throughout 2021 in order to get the constellation to the point where it can serve customers over a much larger portion of the globe. SpaceX COO and President Gwynne Shotwell has previously said that the company expects it should have coverage over much of the globe at a constellation size of around 1,200 satellites, but the company has plans to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/27/spacex-president-we-will-land-starship-on-moon-before-2022.html">launch more than 30,000</a> to fully build out its network capacity and speed.</p>
<p>While SpaceX is making good progress on Starlink with its Falcon 9 launcher, it&#8217;s also looking ahead to Starship as a key driver of the constellation&#8217;s growth. Starship, SpaceX&#8217;s next-generation launch vehicle currently under development in South Texas, will be able to deliver 400 Starlink satellites at a time to orbit, and it&#8217;s also being designed with full reusability and fast turnaround in mind.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ability to launch more than six times as many satellites per mission would help SpaceX a lot in terms of the speed with which they can deploy the Starlink network, as well as the overall cost of the endeavor – assuming their cost projections about Starlink&#8217;s general affordability are even close to accurate once it becomes a high-volume production rocket. That&#8217;s definitely still at least a few years off, but SpaceX did mark a milestone on Wednesday that bodes well for its chances of making that happen.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s latest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/spacexs-starship-prototype-flies-to-32000-feet-and-sticks-the-landing-in-third-flight-test/">Starship prototype performed its most successful test launch to date on Wednesday</a>, taking off from SpaceX&#8217;s Boca Chica, Texas development site and flying to around 32,000 feet before executing a &#8216;flop&#8217; maneuver and then reorienting itself for a soft vertical landing. The test rocket also blew up after sitting on the pad for just under 10 minutes, but despite that spectacular ending, the test proved out a lot of the basic engineering work that SpaceX needs to make Starship a reality.</p>
<p>Starlink is a huge, multi-year effort, so even if Starship is still a few years away from high-volume production and flight, it should still have a significant impact on the project overall. And Starlink, once operational and fully deployed, will require regular maintenance – individual satellites in the network are only really designed to be operational for ups to five years max, with regular replacements required to keep things running smoothly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://hopin.com/">Hopin</a>, a virtual events platform and video-focused software service, announced that it has closed a $400 million Series C. The new capital values Hopin at $5.65 billion. Both numbers match <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/">prior TechCrunch reporting</a> that the company was targeting a $400 million raise at a valuation of between $5 billion and $6 billion.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and General Catalyst (GC) co-led the round, as TechCrunch reported was likely. Prior investor IVP also took part in the round.</p>
<p>For Hopin, the round is another rapid-fire funding event in a string of such transactions. The company has seen scorching revenue growth in recent quarters, reaching $70 million ARR today, its CEO and founder Johnny Boufarhat told TechCrunch in an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the transaction, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/social-platform-veteran-sriram-krishnan-is-andreessen-horowitzs-latest-general-partner/">recent a16z hire</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sriramk">Sriram Krishnan</a> will join Hopin’s board. According to Boufarhat, Hopin had hoped to hire Krishnan before he took his job at the venture firm.</p>
<p>Hopin has scaled rapidly from its now-dated $20 million ARR milestone that it announced in Q4 2020. But not all of that growth has been organic. Hopin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-buys-livestreaming-startup-streamyard-for-250m-as-it-looks-to-expand-its-product-lineup/">recently bought StreamYard</a>, a company that brought $27 million worth of ARR to the combined entity. Hopin spent $250 million on that deal, a transaction that was announced in January of this year.</p>
<p>The company has raised $565 million since February of 2020, it said in an email.</p>
<p>According to Boufarhat, Hopin intends to invest heavily in its product and engineering functions. The CEO stressed during a call that he intends to keep his company’s product spend high as a percentage of revenue; TechCrunch’s read of the sentiment is that Hopin has no intention of letting other companies carve into its core market while it solidifies its virtual event service and adds other capabilities.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tsvsVcFns8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/">VCs are chasing Hopin upwards of $5-6B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;VCs are chasing Hopin upwards of $5-6B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/embed/#?secret=tsvsVcFns8" data-secret="tsvsVcFns8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The StreamYard deal may provide some guidance as to where Hopin is headed. The acquisition brought to Hopin a company that was already in use by some of its own users, but also added a business line to its collection not wholly component to the event work for which Hopin is best-known. Boufarhat told TechCrunch that his company is open to making more acquisitions.</p>
<p>Perhaps we’ll see Hopin extend its reach to other products that fit into its video-first perspective. It certainly has the capital and equity value to buy a plethora of smaller companies.</p>
<p>At $70 million ARR, Hopin is worth around 81x its current annual recurring revenue. When the company last raised, a $125 million round in November of 2020, the company had $20 million in ARR and a valuation of $2.125 billion valuation. At the time the company was worth a little over 106x its ARR. In light of the company’s recent growth, investors in that round now paid a far-smaller 30.4x ARR multiple, contrasting the company’s new revenue mark and its now-dated valuation.</p>
<p>Provided that Hopin can continue its rapid growth, its current ARR multiple could appear closer to norms in a few quarters.</p>
<p>Closing, Hopin does not appear ready to answer the siren-song of the SPAC. Boufarhat told TechCrunch that he receives regular outreach from SPACs, something we’ve heard from a number of late-stage technology CEOs. Hopin’s founder, however, noted that great companies can go public regardless of the market, and that his company intends on being operationally IPO-ready next year. It appears that a more traditional IPO for Hopin could be in the cards for 2022 or 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There has been a rapid proliferation of roll-up companies armed with wallets full of money to consolidate promising smaller merchants that sell on Amazon and other marketplaces, the idea being to create economies of scale to help them sell more effectively and grow. Today, a company that is somewhat doing the opposite &#8212; building tools to help Amazon sellers work better on their own &#8212; is announcing significant funding to keep growing its business.</p>
<p>Jungle Scout, an Austin-based company that builds tools covering services like search and market analytics, inventory management, and sales intelligence for companies selling on Amazon, has raised $110 million in equity that it is using in part to make an acquisition &#8212; Downstream Impact, a specialist in Amazon advertising founded by two ex-Amazon execs who did early work on Amazon&#8217;s in-house advertising efforts &#8212; and in part to continue growing its business.</p>
<p>You may not know the name but Jungle Scout it is quietly huge. It says that its tools impact some $8 billion in Amazon revenue with around 500,000 brands and entrepreneurs already using it. Its data engine ingests search, purchasing, and other information for some 500 million Amazon products, which it then turns into data to help customers sell on Amazon better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jungle Scout began life in 2015 focusing primarily on providing optimizing search tools for sellers solely on Amazon &#8212; if you didn&#8217;t guess that already by the &#8220;Jungle&#8221; and &#8220;Scout&#8221; in its name. Tools for improving business on Amazon still make up the bulk of its business, with its functionality covering not just Amazon.com but nine other regional Amazons. But now, the startup is slowly starting to expand its services beyond that. That could include Google Shopping, Facebook&#8217;s many social platforms, and more &#8212; whichever marketplace platforms consumers happen to be using.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are starting with Walmart.com, which will be live in near future,&#8221; CEO Greg Mercer said in an interview, &#8220;and the vision is to expand beyond that. We’re bullish on the future of Amazon, but if we think beyond that, my prediction would be that besides those platforms where people primarily go to purchase things, there are places where consumers spend their time &#8212; such as Google or social channels like Instagram &#8212; that could be other areas where we could provide tools to sell through.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup is also building out its business on the ground in China, he said. The country represents one of the fastest growing source countries not just for goods, but merchants, too.</p>
<p>Summit Partners, the venture capital and private equity firm, is the primary investor in this funding round, with Mercer himself also contributing. It&#8217;s not clear how much Jungle Scout has raised to date: PitchBook notes that Summit had backed it previously, in 2017, at an undisclosed sum and valuation. I&#8217;ve confirmed that the $110 million being disclosed today is the first time that Jungle Scout has revealed how much money it has raised over the years, although it&#8217;s still not disclosing its valuation.</p>
<p>You might notice that in the first paragraph of this story I mentioned that Jungle Scout is &#8220;somewhat&#8221; taking a different approach to the roll-up companies, companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>, <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroes</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perch</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berlin Brands Group</a>, and doubtless others that are raising giant sums of money to source, and then partner with or buy up, third party sellers.</p>
<p>Jungle Scout does indeed provide a valuable service to Amazon retailers who are leveraging the giant&#8217;s <a href="https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBA platform</a> to manage a range of services like inventory, shipping and marketing (in the form of appearing on Amazon to sell things), and who want to remain independent and not be &#8220;rolled up.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, that&#8217;s not actually the full story. Mercer tells me that his company also provides its technology as a white label service to most of the big roll-up players &#8212; which of these, he did not note &#8212; and so you might also say that even if third-party merchants are not working directly with Jungle Scout, they might well end up doing so indirectly.</p>
<p>The opportunity for building out more tools to address the Amazon economy is a massive one. As we&#8217;ve pointed out before, it is<a href="https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> estimated</a> that the number of third-party sellers on Amazon currently stands around 5 million, a number that appears to be growing exponentially at the moment, with more than 1 million sellers joining the platform last year. That includes not just smaller retailers who are looking to extend their consumer touch-points, but also increasingly a number of big brands that are now looking at how they can leverage Amazon better to sell directly to consumers on the platform, rather than via third-party merchants.</p>
<p>Within that, advertising remains a huge and growing part of the equation.</p>
<p>If you are an Amazon user, you&#8217;ll notice that ads search pages have been growing in number over the years (these are the sponsored results that come up at the top of searches you might make for a product), and so you will be unsurprised to know that advertising, as a result, is really growing fast for Amazon itself.</p>
<p>Ads alone accounted for $21.5 billion in annual revenue for Amazon in 2020, up 66% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Connor Folley, Downstream&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with another ex-Amazonian, Salim Hamed (who is Downstream&#8217;s CTO), told me that ads &#8220;within the walls of Amazon itself&#8221; still make up the majority of that figure, although it will continue to invest in areas like its DSP to expand beyond its own ecosystem. That makes it somewhat of a dark horse in the world of advertising, which up to now has been more concerned with the rise of Facebook among &#8220;new&#8221; players.</p>
<p>&#8220;The explosive growth of Amazon advertising over the last five years has surpassed many people&#8217;s expectations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It might be a $50 billion dollar platform by 2023 &#8212; and much bigger than Facebook.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there are a lot of companies out there building tools and alternatives for sellers to get a better grip to sell on Amazon, the attraction here has been in part the size of Jungle Scout and its prescience in building this market in the first place.</p>
<p>“Jungle Scout was one of the first companies to identify the opportunity to provide SaaS-based tools to help businesses and brands expand their ecommerce footprints on Amazon and beyond, and the company has built on this leadership position over the last several years,” said Neil Roseman, Technologist-in-Residence at Summit Partners and Jungle Scout Board Director, in a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a strong vote of confidence when you consider that Roseman himself is also an ex-Amazonian, having been its VP of technology between 1998 and 2007 working on marketplace technology among other things. “We believe Jungle Scout’s technology is robust and highly scalable, designed to help a company to grow as the Amazon third-party selling ecosystem has expanded. We believe the addition of Downstream Impact will add to this product and engineering strength, and we are thrilled to be a part of the company’s growth journey.”</p>

<p>Privately-held firm <a href="https://www.capco.com/">Capco</a>, which employs about 5,000 consultants and had raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/capco/company_financials">about $80 million</a> from investors 20 years ago, is &#8220;widely acknowledged for its deep domain and consulting expertise, risk and regulatory offerings and thought leadership around key industry technology challenges and opportunities. In addition, Capco services clients in the energy and commodities trading sector,&#8221; the two firms said in a joint press release.</p>

<p>&#8220;Together, we can deliver high-end consulting and technology transformations, and operations offerings to our clients. Wipro and Capco share complimentary business models and core guiding values, and I am certain that our new Capco colleagues will be proud to call Wipro home,&#8221; said Thierry Delaporte, CEO and Managing Director of Wipro, who assumed the top role last year.</p>
<p>Delaporte replaced Abidali Neemuchwala, who led the company for four years and fell short of delivering Wipro&#8217;s target of becoming a $15 billion firm by 2020. The company&#8217;s revenue at the end of March last year was $8.1 billion.</p>
<p>Under the new leadership, Wipro is increasingly chasing clients in Europe and Asia. The firm last year landed orders from European clean energy firms Fortum and E.On. It has publicly stated that it is also looking to acquire firms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together, we will offer bespoke transformational end-to-end solutions, now powered by innovative technology at scale, to create a new leading partner to the financial services industry. We look forward to leveraging the complementary capabilities and similar cultures of both companies to drive industry change and offer exciting opportunities for both our clients, and our people,&#8221; said Lance Levy, CEO of Capco, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is facing another antitrust investigation in Europe into how it operates the iOS App Store.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-investigates-apple-over-suspected-anti-competitive-behaviour">announced today</a> that it&#8217;s opened an investigation following a number of complaints from developers alleging unfair terms and as a result of its own work in the digital sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CMA’s investigation will consider whether Apple has a dominant position in connection with the distribution of apps on Apple devices in the UK &#8212; and, if so, whether Apple imposes unfair or anti-competitive terms on developers using the App Store, ultimately resulting in users having less choice or paying higher prices for apps and add-ons,&#8221; it wrote in a press release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is only the beginning of the investigation and no decision has yet been made on whether Apple is breaking the law,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>In a statement, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, also said: “Millions of us use apps every day to check the weather, play a game or order a takeaway. So, complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice &#8212; potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps – warrant careful scrutiny.&#8221;</p>
<p>An Apple spokesperson sent us this statement in response to the CMA action:</p>
<blockquote><p>We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for customers to download the apps they love and a great business opportunity for developers everywhere. In the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, and any developer with a great idea is able to reach Apple customers around the world.</p>
<p>We believe in thriving and competitive markets where any great idea can flourish. The App Store has been an engine of success for app developers, in part because of the rigorous standards we have in place — applied fairly and equally to all developers — to protect customers from malware and to prevent rampant data collection without their consent. We look forward to working with the UK Competition and Markets Authority to explain how our guidelines for privacy, security and content have made the App Store a trusted marketplace for both consumers and developers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The European Union already has an open antitrust investigation into a number of elements of Apple&#8217;s business, following complaints in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-a-complaint-against-apple-with-the-european-commission-over-apple-tax-and-restrictive-rules/">2019</a> by music-streaming service Spotify &#8212; announcing a probe of the App Store and the iPhone maker&#8217;s payment offering, Apple Pay,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/"> last summer</a>.</p>
<p>US lawmakers have also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing/">questioning Apple</a> as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/big-tech-blows-a-collective-raspberry-at-the-houses-antitrust-report/">major antitrust probe into big tech</a>. And a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation">bill has just advanced in Arizona</a> that aims to force both Apple and Google to allow third party payment options in their smartphone stores.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s Apple investigation, meanwhile, remains ongoing. The video games publisher Epic Games &#8212; which has been engaged in a vicious public battle with Apple over what it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/epic-games-founder-tim-sweeney-likens-fight-against-apple-to-fight-for-civil-rights/">decries as Cupertino&#8217;s unfair &#8216;tax&#8217; on developers</a> &#8212; recently sought to join the EU&#8217;s case by filing a complaint with the European Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/">last month</a>.</p>
<p>Epic previously filed the same complaint in the UK &#8212; so it&#8217;s one of the unhappy developers the CMA cites.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ocm2BNCQ7x"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/">Epic Games takes its Apple App Store fight to Europe</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With the UK now outside the European Union, the CMA looks set to take on a more prominent role as a regional regulator. Post-Brexit, it&#8217;s free to investigate the same issues as the Commission (whereas under EU rules national regulators are supposed to avoid duplicating effort).</p>
<p>If it can move faster than the bloc&#8217;s competition commission it may have the opportunity to mould the standards that apply to tech giants. (Although the CMA said today that it &#8220;continues to coordinate closely&#8221; with the Commission and other agencies to tackle what it described as &#8220;global concerns&#8221;.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">Last fall</a> the UK also announced a plan to establish a pro-competition regulation regime aimed at tackling the market power of big tech. That followed a major market study of online platforms and digital advertising carried out by the CMA &#8212; which published its <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-advises-government-on-new-regulatory-regime-for-tech-giants" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-advises-government-on-new-regulatory-regime-for-tech-giants&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614939371368000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoqJdhY66ABgfrnuOZl3FX1Fmw-w">advice to the government</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> on shaping that regime in December. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;As the CMA works with the government on these proposals – which will complement its current enforcement powers – the CMA will continue to use its existing powers to their fullest extent in order to protect competition in these areas,&#8221; it said today.</span></p>
<p>“Our ongoing examination into digital markets has already uncovered some worrying trends,&#8221; Coscelli added. &#8220;We know that businesses, as well as consumers, may suffer real harm if anti-competitive practices by big tech go unchecked. That’s why we’re pressing on with setting up the new Digital Markets Unit and launching new investigations wherever we have grounds to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other recent actions targeting tech giants, the CMA has opened an investigation into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">Google&#8217;s plan to phase out third party tracking cookies</a> &#8212; and launched an inquiry into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/ubers-autocab-acquisition-gets-eyed-by-uk-competition-watchdog/">Uber&#8217;s planned acquisition of UK-based SaaS maker Autocab</a>.</p>
<p>In its final<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5efc57ed3a6f4023d242ed56/Final_report_1_July_2020_.pdf"> report</a> into the online ad market last year, it concluded that the market power of Google and Facebook had become so great a new regulatory approach and a dedicated oversight body is needed to address what it summarized as “wide ranging and self reinforcing” concerns. The forthcoming Digital Markets Unit will form a key part of the UK&#8217;s planned regulatory response to big tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s relaxation of its one-child restriction has not delivered the population targets set by its policy planners. In 2019, the birth rate in China <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51145251#:~:text=China's%20birth%20rate%20has%20fallen,National%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics%20said.">slumped</a> to a seven-decade low, which experts attribute to changes in social attitudes, skyrocketing living costs as well as a demanding work culture.</p>
<p>One way to fix China&#8217;s demographic crisis is to lighten mothers&#8217; burden, said Ding Lei, founder and CEO of NetEase, the second-biggest gaming company in China which also runs a popular music streaming service.</p>
<p>Ding made the proposal at China&#8217;s annual parliament session this week, comprising the meetings of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Each spring, delegates from a wide range of backgrounds, including political elites and tech billionaires, gather in Beijing for the legislative meetings informally known as the &#8220;two sessions.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ding is a member of the CPPCC, which includes other tech bosses like Tencent&#8217;s Pony Ma, Xiaomi&#8217;s Lei Jun and Baidu&#8217;s Robin Li. Ding suggested efforts should be directed to address costly childbearing, short maternity leave, an undersupply of children&#8217;s healthcare, an underdeveloped childcare system and other &#8220;practical pain points&#8221; to take burdens off women&#8217;s shoulders.</p>
<p>Ding further advocated for shared parental leave &#8220;at one&#8217;s discretion&#8221; to &#8220;give men more responsibilities in parenting.&#8221; The country, he argued, should bear women&#8217;s reproductive costs and the number of nursery facilities should be increased.</p>
<p>Most provinces in China have introduced paternity leave in recent years, but the length and implementation efforts vary across regions. In Guangdong, home to NetEase and Tencent, fathers are entitled to up to <a href="http://wjw.sz.gov.cn/gzcy/ywzs/jhsy/content/post_3194413.html">15 days</a> of paid paternity leave. Shanghai, on the other hand, falls on the lower end of the spectrum with <a href="http://rsj.sh.gov.cn/tfkcx_17604/20200617/t0035_1369659.html">10 days</a>.</p>
<p>But some experts <a href="https://s.weibo.com/weibo/%25E5%25A4%25AB%25E5%25A6%25BB%25E5%2590%2588%25E4%25BC%2591%25E4%25BA%25A7%25E5%2581%2587?topnav=1&amp;wvr=6&amp;b=1">argue</a> the one-week average for fathers is far from enough to liberate new mothers, who receive <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2017-07/19/content_30164656.htm">a minimum of 98 days</a> of paid maternity leave but could get more depending on where they reside. NetEase&#8217;s family leave policy is in line with national and regional regulations, a company representative told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Occasionally, China&#8217;s tech giants disclose or give hints about their gender ratio. In 2019, 35% of NetEase&#8217;s 20,000 employees were women, the company says, and about 25% of its top management were female in the year. Online travel agent Ctrip, which prides itself on<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/03/08/1750413/0/en/Ctrip-CEO-Jane-Sun-Says-Tax-Exemption-Would-Encourage-Enterprises-to-Benefit-Women.html"> benefits for female employees</a>, said <a href="https://money.163.com/18/0308/20/DCDFG67E002580S6.html">in 2018</a> that over 60% of its staff were female. Jack Ma, a frequent speaker at female leadership forums, <a href="https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2019-08-28/doc-ihytcitn2497633.shtml">pledged</a> in 2019 that females must make up more than 33% of Alibaba staff.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food delivery start-up Deliveroo has today confirmed its £8bn ($11bn) stock market floatation in London, something which was on the cards previously.</p>
<p>The eight-year-old company will use the “dual-class” innovation which has been introduced to the London Stock Exchange by the UK government in a bid to keep UK companies from being lured over to the NASDAQ, as well as attract continental European listings.</p>
<p>The listing will be on the London Stock Exchange’s “premium” segment. Dual-class shares are popular in the US &#8211; where it is used by companies such as Facebook and Alphabet &#8211; because it allows founders to take a longer view of strategy and retain more control of their companies during decisions such as mergers and acquisitions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Will Shu, CEO of Deliveroo, said in a statement: “Deliveroo was born in London. This is where I founded the company and delivered our first order. London is a great place to live, work, do business and eat. That’s why I&#8217;m so proud and excited about a potential listing here.”</p>
<p>Deliveroo’s business has boomed during pandemic-related lockdowns &#8211; it posted six-months of consecutive profits throughout this period &#8211;  and now plans to expand.</p>
<p>Although Deliveroo’s listing came comes just a day after the British government gave the green light to recommendations for the dual-class shares, Deliveroo’s listing was always expected to be in London, given it’s UK base, so this news looks to have a political tinge attached to it. Indeed, the press release was handily issued with a supportive statement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
<p>Claudia Arney, Chair of Deliveroo, said: &#8220;The time-limited dual-class structure would provide Will and his team with the certainty needed to execute against their ambitious growth plan to become the definitive online food company.”</p>
<p>Deliveroo’s plans include expanding its &#8216;ghost&#8217; kitchens; on-demand grocery; extending its Plus subscription service; and offering its Signature service to restaurants, which allows customers to order delivery via a restaurants’ own website.</p>
<p>The multibillion-pound IPO will be a shot in the arm for The City after Amsterdam overtook London as Europe’s largest share trading center in January, post-Brexit.</p>
<p>Deliveroo pegged a $7 billion valuation in January after raising $180 million from investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bolt.eu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt</a>, an Uber competitor that is building an international on-demand network of services to transport people, food and other items in cars, scooters and bikes across Europe and Africa, has picked up some strategic funding today to continue expanding its business in emerging markets.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ifc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Finance Corporation</a>, a division of the World Bank, is investing €20 million ($24 million) in the Tallinn, Estonia-based startup to open up more services across Eastern Europe and Africa, with a specific mention of more services in<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Ukraine and Nigeria, two of those regions&#8217; biggest economies, and more innovative services to target demographic groups that might be under-represented or under-served, such as women. </span></p>
<p>Funding from the IFC is a significant endorsement of a company, if at the same time a relatively small amount compared to Bolt&#8217;s wider fundraising efforts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most recently, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bolt-raises-182m-to-expand-its-on-demand-transportation-network-in-europe-and-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $182 million in December</a> at a significant hike to its previous valuation (which had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/bolt-the-european-on-demand-transport-company-raises-109m-on-a-1-9b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.9 billion</a>). A Bolt spokesperson tells us that, once again, &#8220;our valuation has grown with the latest funding round, but we&#8217;re not disclosing the updated number.&#8221; (For the record, in December we calculated that the valuaton was probably around $4.3 billion, based on a 1.5x multiple on GMV of €3.5 billion, figures provided to us by CEO and co-founder Markus Villig. That figure wasn&#8217;t disputed, nor confirmed, though.)</p>
<p>People may not consider the IFC in the same breath as more typical VCs like SoftBank, Sequoia, Index Ventures, or Andreessen Horowitz, but it&#8217;s a significant player when it comes to backing startups around the world. Last year alone it invested $22 billion in companies, it said.</p>
<p>Backing a transportation startup is a notable move for it, considering that a lot of the IFC&#8217;s interest in tech has typically been around financial services. For example, it has also invested money into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/26/currencycloud-nabs-80m-from-visa-world-bank-group-and-more-for-its-cross-border-payments-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CurrencyCloud</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/remitly-raises-another-38m-adds-world-banks-ifc-as-it-pushes-into-emerging-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remitly</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/10/compareasiagroup-scores-50m-from-investors-including-ifc-alibaba-and-goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CompareAsiaGroup</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/23/online-lender-kreditech-closes-out-series-c-at-103m-after-getting-11m-from-the-ifc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kreditech</a>, among others.</p>
<p>But improving transportation is another development target &#8212; in particular when you consider that companies like Bolt are built like marketplaces that provide income to people, infrastructure to businesses (in the form of delivery), on top of its most obvious service helping consumers get around.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to partnering with IFC to further support entrepreneurship, empower women and increase access to affordable mobility services in Africa and Eastern Europe,&#8221; said Villig, in a statement. &#8220;Together with the investment from the European Investment Bank last year, we are proud to have sizable and strategically important institutions backing us and recognizing the strategic value Bolt is providing to emerging economies”.</p>
<p>Bolt&#8217;s efforts in emerging markets have long been one the key ways that the company differentiates itself from Uber &#8212; perhaps logical, considering that the company itself was founded in an emerging economy. Since launching in 2013, it has picked up over 50 million customers and more than 1.5 million drivers in 40 countries, including 400,000 drivers in 70 cities on the African continent.</p>
<p>That strategy has also grown over time to include services for under-represented groups in these under-represented markets. Bolt is piloting a &#8220;Women Only&#8221; ride-hailing service in South Africa, with female drivers and passengers to improve job opportunities and general safety, one of the programs that the IFC funding will support, it said.</p>
<p>“Technology can and should unlock new pathways for sustainable development and women’s empowerment,&#8221; said Stephanie von Friedeburg, IFC Senior Vice President of Operations, in a statement. &#8220;Our investment in Bolt aims to help tap into technology to disrupt the transport sector in a way that is good for the environment, creates more flexible work opportunities for women, and provides safer and more affordable transportation access in emerging markets.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://countingup.com/">Countingup</a>, the U.K. fintech offering a business current account with built-in accounting features, has closed £9.1 million in Series A investment. Leading the round is Framework Venture Partners, with participation from Gresham House Ventures, Sage and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/countingup-bridge/">existing investors</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s noteworthy that Countingup has previously taken investment from ING, and the addition of Sage as a backer is interesting since both could help the startup reach more business customers. It also potentially sets up one future road to exit. However, let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Tim Fouracre, who previously founded cloud accounting software Clear Books, Countingup now boasts over 34,000 business customers. The company&#8217;s long-term vision is to be the one “financial hub” for micro businesses in the U.K. and beyond. Its initial &#8220;attack vector&#8221; was to combine a business bank account with bookkeeping features to help automate the filing of accounts — a major time sink and pain-point for sole traders and small businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OPnE7bcDeu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/countingup-bridge/">Countingup scores £4M bridge round for its small business banking and accounting app</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Countingup scores £4M bridge round for its small business banking and accounting app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/countingup-bridge/embed/#?secret=OPnE7bcDeu" data-secret="OPnE7bcDeu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today that includes a business bank account with its own sort code and account number, a Mastercard for making payments and support for faster payments and direct debits. On the accounting software side, Countingup currently supports automated bookkeeping, invoicing, receipts, payment of bills, tax estimates and profit and loss reporting.</p>
<p>In addition, accountants can be given limited access via the web to better support clients banking with Countingup. This includes the option for business owners to share real-time bookkeeping data with their accountant, &#8220;eliminating the pains of re-authorisation requests, data lags, duplicates, and inaccuracies,&#8221; says the fintech.</p>
<p>To that end, Fouracre tells me the new funding will be used to quickly scale up the team from 30 to 80 people. &#8220;This will accelerate our roadmap enabling more swim lanes of product work to be on the go concurrently,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>That roadmap includes tax filing, new financial services (e.g. loans, card payment services) and multi-currency invoicing and payments to support the 33% of SMEs in the U.K. that trade internationally. A web version of the app for small business customers is planned too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will also be building out our sales and marketing teams for more aggressive growth,&#8221; adds Fouracre.</p>
<p>Countingup&#8217;s business model combines both SaaS and fintech. On the SaaS side, the company earns monthly subscription fees. On the fintech side, it generates revenue from banking activity (e.g. interchange fees) on Mastercard spend. In the future, that will likely include other sources of income via offering credit, payments and FX.</p>
<p>Comments Neal Watkins, EVP, Small Business Segment at Sage: “Investing in high-growth SaaS businesses is core to our strategy to enable small businesses and accountants to survive and thrive. This is an exciting opportunity to be part of the startup journey in a new way as businesses explore the benefits of bringing accounting and financial services together&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp is rolling out support for voice and video calling to its desktop app, the Facebook-owned messaging service said Thursday, providing relief to countless people sitting in front of computers who have had to reach for their phone every time their WhatsApp rang.</p>
<p>For now, WhatsApp said its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/whatsapp-desktop-client/">nearly five-year-old desktop app</a> for Mac and Windows will only support one-to-one calls for now, but that it will be expanding this feature to include group voice and video calls “in the future.”</p>
<p>Video calls work “seamlessly” for both portrait and landscape orientation, and the desktop client is “set to be always on top so you never lose your video chats in a browser tab or stack of open windows,” the firm said, which began testing the feature with a small group of users on desktop late last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking of which, support for voice and video calls is not being extended to WhatsApp Web, the browser version of the service, at the moment, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. (Facebook launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/facebook-messenger-desktop-app-2/">dedicated desktop app for its Messenger service last year</a>, which supports group video calls.)</p>
<p>The new feature support should come in handy to millions of people who use WhatsApp’s desktop client everyday and have had to use Zoom or Google Meet for one-to-one video calls on desktop partly because of convenience.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">used by over 2 billion people</a>, hasn’t shared how popular video and voice calls are on its platform, but said it processed over 1.4 billion calls on New Year’s Eve &#8212; the day usage tends to peak on the Facebook-owned platform.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/whatsapp-is-now-delivering-roughly-100-billion-messages-a-day/">100 billion messages</a> that WhatsApp processes on its platform each day, voice and video calls are also end-to-end encrypted, it said.</p>
<p>Once known for taking quarters to push a feature improvement to its app, WhatsApp has visibly grown more aggressive with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/facebook-adds-carts-to-whatsapp-to-make-shopping-easier/">adding new features</a> in the past year. In late January, Facebook added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/whatsapp-is-adding-opt-in-biometrics-to-its-web-and-desktop-versions/">opt-in biometric fingerprint, face, or iris scan authentication</a> for WhatsApp on desktop and the web, an additional protection layer that makes more sense after today’s update.</p>
<p>It rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-now-lets-you-post-disappearing-messages-which-go-away-after-7-days/">ephemeral messages</a>, photos, and videos that disappear after seven days late last year, and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india/">rolled out its payments service in India</a>, its biggest market by users.</p>
<p>The new feature additions come as WhatsApp is attempting to convince users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/whatsapp-details-what-will-happen-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-privacy-changes/">agree to its planned changes to privacy policy</a> &#8212; which has received some heat on Tech Twitter. Whether those concerns raised by a handful of people on Twitter extend to the larger population remain to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.payfazz.com/">Payfazz</a> and <a href="https://www.xfers.com/">Xfers</a>, two startups that want to increase financial inclusion in Southeast Asia, announced today they have joined forces to create a new holding entity called Fazz Financial Group. As part of the deal, Payfazz, an agent-based financial services network in Indonesia, invested $30 million into payments infrastructure provider Xfers.</p>
<p>Based in Singapore, Xfers will serve as the B2B and Southeast Asia arm of Fazz Financial Group, while Payfazz, which already uses Xfers’ payments infrastructure, will continue expanding in Indonesia. The two companies will retain their names while working together under the new holding entity.</p>
<p>Both Payfazz and Xfers are Y Combinator alums, and want to make financial services accessible to more Southeast Asians, even if they don’t have a bank account. Xfers co-founder Tianwei Liu told TechCrunch in an email he and Payfazz co-founder Hendra Kwik began talking about joining forces in early 2020 because of their startups&#8217; shared goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is also coupled with the fact that last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has driven a significant increase in demand for digital payments and financial services across Indonesian rural areas, creating a huge growth opportunity for us,&#8221; Liu added.</p>
<p>Kwik will serve as Fazz Financial Group’s group CEO, while Liu will be the financial entity’s deputy CEO. Both will continue serving as CEOs of their respective companies. Fazz Financial Group also appointed as its chief financial officer Robert Polana, who previously held the same role at booking platform Tiket.com.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, Payfazz has built a network of 250,000 financial agents to reach people in rural areas where many banks don’t operate branches. Customers deposit cash with agents, and that balance can used to pay phone, electricity and other bills.</p>
<p>Payfazz, which announced a $53 million Series B in July from investors including Tiger Global and Y Combinator, also offers loans and payment services for offline retailers. As part of Fazz Financial Group, it will continue to build its agent banking network.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Payfazz gets $53 million to give more Indonesians access to financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/payfazz-gets-53-million-to-give-more-indonesians-access-to-financial-services/embed/#?secret=k25WJxP4VZ" data-secret="k25WJxP4VZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Payfazz uses payment infrastructure developed by Xfers to accept digital payments. Originally launched six years ago with an API for bank transfers, Xfers has since expanded its portfolio of software to include payment acceptance for businesses, tools for disbursing and transferring funds and a cryptocurrency wallet. In 2020, Xfers obtained a Major Payment Institution license for e-money issuance from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
<p>Xfers will continue to serve clients in Indonesia and Singapore with its payments infrastructure, which enables them to accept bank transfers, e-wallet funds and payments through convenience stores and agent banking networks (like Payfazz). Xfers says it has access to more than 10 million underbanked consumers in Indonesia through its work with agent banking services, and also plans to expand into Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Fazz Financial Group plans to launch two new products later this year: a zero-integration payment solution for Singapore-based merchants and a single-integration solution that will connect local payment methods across Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Liu said that, unlike the United States, Southeast Asia &#8220;has a fragmented local payments landscape, even within each country,&#8221; meaning that consumers often use several payment methods. Creating a single-integration for payment methods in Southeast Asia gives brands a growth channel when entering new countries, allowing them to scale up more quickly, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown has also driven a big surge in online sales and transactions across Southeast Asia, so there is a huge need for online payments by businesses and merchants across the region,&#8221; Liu said. &#8220;The zero-integration and single-integration solution will help businesses and merchants start accepting online payments quickly and easily with a simple integration within minutes, without any need to deal with complex regulation/license handling and technology development.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security flaw in a website run by the government of West Bengal in India exposed the lab results of at least hundreds of thousands of residents, though likely millions, who took a COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>The website is part of the West Bengal government&#8217;s mass coronavirus testing program. Once a COVID-19 test result is ready, the government sends a text message to the patient with a link to its website containing their test results.</p>
<p>But security researcher Sourajeet Majumder found that the link containing the patient&#8217;s unique test identification number was scrambled with base64 encoding, which can be easily converted using online tools. Because the identification numbers were incrementally sequenced, the website bug meant that anyone could change that number in their browser&#8217;s address bar and view other patients&#8217; test results.</p>
<p>The test results contain the patient&#8217;s name, sex, age, postal address, and if the patient&#8217;s lab test result came back positive, negative, or inconclusive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Majumder told TechCrunch that he was concerned a malicious attacker could scrape the site and sell the data. &#8220;This is a privacy violation if somebody else gets access to my private information,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120578" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120578" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2120578 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg" alt="Two COVID-19 lab test results, but with details redacted, to show what kind of data has been exposed." width="1024" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg 2460w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=1536,1010 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=2048,1346 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/west-bengal-covid-test-redacted.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120578" class="wp-caption-text">Two redacted COVID-19 lab test results exposed as a result of a security vulnerability on the West Bengal government&#8217;s website. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>Majumder reported the vulnerability to India&#8217;s CERT, the country&#8217;s dedicated cybersecurity response unit, which acknowledged the issue in an email. He also contacted the West Bengal government&#8217;s website manager, who did not respond. TechCrunch independently confirmed the vulnerability and also reached out to the West Bengal government, which pulled the website offline, but did not return our requests for comment.</p>
<p>TechCrunch held our report until the vulnerability was fixed or no longer presented a risk. At the time of publication, the affected website remains offline.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not known exactly how many COVID-19 lab results were exposed because of this security lapse, or if anyone other than Majumder discovered the vulnerability. At the time the website was pulled offline at the end of February, the state government had tested more than 8.5 million residents for COVID-19.</p>
<p>West Bengal is one of the most populated states of India, with about 90 million residents. Since the start of the pandemic, the state government has recorded more than 10,000 coronavirus deaths.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest of several security incidents in the past few months to hit India and its response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Last May, India&#8217;s largest cell network Jio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/02/jio-coronavirus-security-lapse/">admitted a security lapse</a> after a security researcher found a database containing the company&#8217;s coronavirus symptom checker, which Jio had launched months earlier.</p>
<p>In October, a security researcher found Dr Lal PathLabs left hundreds of spreadsheets containing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/dr-lal-pathlabs-exposed-patient-lab-data/">millions of patient booking records</a> — including for COVID-19 tests — on a public storage server that was not protected with a password, allowing anyone to access sensitive patient data.</p>

<p>Of all the gin joints etc. etc. Clubhouse continues to confound those who don&#8217;t believe in the restorative powers of the Next Big Thing. It doesn&#8217;t make sense, they say, that an audio service based on live podcasts will change the course of human history, And they are right. Social computing is in the doghouse in the wake of January 6 and the former president. But the folks behind Clubhouse have gotten a few key things right.</p>
<p>The main thing is that in the beginning of the return to some rational possibility for the suppression of Covid, we&#8217;re opening our hearts to the hope we&#8217;ve abandoned for more than a year. Our children are crying at the prospects of returning to school, to the classroom, to the hallway rendezvous with friends, to the safety of the arc of life translating across generations and family stories. We&#8217;re tentatively daring to believe in things we took for granted even as we rebelled against them in our youthful exploration of the world we were on the cusp of creating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Social was never about challenging the existing world, the stagnant media, the secret passageways to our own version of new history. It was about creating a storyline for our generation that we could invest in. And the fuel we sought was trust. If we work backwards from the current reigning media, it&#8217;s easy to see when trust was discounted. Some call this partisanship, but it&#8217;s deeper than that.</p>
<p>As we choose our guiding voices, the fragmentation of media sources has made it much more difficult to commit to one individual, party, or candidate. The world my parents gave us was dominated by 3 television networks as the war wound down. In the placid feel of the Fifties, we took our daily cues from Walter Cronkite, Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, and influential but overmatched anchors from ABC, the most junior of the three networks. David Brinkley was my favorite, with a dry wit that fit nicely with the gruff grit of his co-anchor.</p>
<p>But Cronkite was the one we all trusted in the end. When he broke with Johnson on the Vietnam War, he basically set the course for the unwinding of our presence. He was the father figure who told us JFK was dead; now he was saying the government was lying to us. The images of defeat filled our screens. Who were we going to believe, our lying eyes?</p>
<p>Retreat changed our national story of invincibility. The media splintered into slivers of respectability, the Hollywood of the studio system replaced by Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, and the Godfather, which taught us who was really in charge. Nixon resigned but no one won the job of leading the country. Decades passed.</p>
<p>But what didn&#8217;t change was radio. From FDR&#8217;s Fireside Chats to the Martian broadcast of Mercury Theater fame to the Firesign Theatre&#8217;s prophetic Beat the Reaper, radio survived as a direct channel to our innermost fears and imagination. And the catchphrase Wherever you go, there you are has never been so resonant as it is in the Pandemic Age wherever you don&#8217;t go, there you are.</p>
<p>Clubhouse may be enforced upon us, but it directly competes with the other media channels we&#8217;ve adhered to in this struggle with manmade and medical viri. The other night, I ping-ponged back and forth between an MSNBC political discussion and a Clubhouse newsletter room. Now I just leave the sound off and surf the lower-third captions on TV, opting for the good choice of silence and Clubhouse rooms. The arguments may rage about Clubhouse rules, agendas, and visions of unicorns, but as Thunderclap Newman sang, there&#8217;s Something in the Air.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re playing house with the app, anticipating an Android version and meaningful competition from Twitter&#8217;s Spaces, currently in a limited private beta and apparent element of a mashup with newsletter acquisition Revue and possible subscription plus schemes. We&#8217;re using Revue here on the Gang newsletter, which you can get by clicking at the end of this post or at the URL in the show above. For the moment, we&#8217;re testing Clubhouse private rooms with the members of the Gang. A button labelled Open It Up yearns to be clicked.</p>
<p>As viewers of the Gillmor Gang can attest, the show has always had the feeling of an organic conversation loosely managed by a moderator, namely me. Mostly I accept the designation, which defaults to me most frequently when things go wrong, too long, or with no seeming direction. But I actually treasure the moments when the moderator in each of us steps up to take a whack at the job. Clubhouse is onto this in its moderator design, which lets the originating speaker delegate moderator status to others on the stage.</p>
<p>In our experiments, I emulate the Gang dynamics by assigning this power to all the Gang. They then have, among other things, the ability to kick me back to listener status, and force me to beg for readmittance to the club. More productively, they can invite others to the stage, and even give them moderator status. Already, moderator follows are a prized indicator of status, but the simple organic power of letting both the thematic and social dynamics flow free in the air are seductive, slightly dangerous, and better than cable.</p>
