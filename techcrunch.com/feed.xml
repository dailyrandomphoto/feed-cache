										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/spotify-is-test-driving-a-car-hardware-thing-called-car-thing/">began testing</a> a hardware device for automobile owners it lovingly dubbed &#8220;<a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-05-17/5-things-to-know-about-spotifys-latest-test/">Car Thing</a>,&#8221; which allowed Spotify Premium users to play music and podcasts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-17-spotify-car-thing-voice-assistant-device.html">using voice commands</a> that began with &#8220;Hey, Spotify.&#8221; Last year, Spotify <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1235350117802283011">began developing</a> a similar voice integration into its mobile app. Now, access to the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice feature is rolling out more broadly.</p>
<p>Spotify chose not to officially announce the new addition, despite numerous reports indicating the voice option was showing up for many people in their Spotify app, leading to some user confusion about availability.</p>
<p>One early report by <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/handsfree_hey_spotify_wake_word_rolls_out-news-48521.php">GSM Arena,</a> for example, indicated Android users had been sent a push notification that alerted them to the feature. The notification advised users to <em>&#8220;Just enable your mic and say &#8216;Hey Spotify, Play my Favorite Songs.&#8221;</em> When tapped, the notification launched Spotify&#8217;s new voice interface where users are pushed to first give the app permission to use the microphone in order to be able to verbally request the music they want to hear.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2135493" style="width: 307px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135493" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2135493" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?w=297" alt="" width="297" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg 652w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=66,150 66w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=131,300 131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=297,680 297w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-5.40.39-PM.jpg?resize=22,50 22w" sizes="(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/handsfree_hey_spotify_wake_word_rolls_out-news-48521.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSM Arena <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Several outlets soon reported the feature had launched to Android users, which is only partially true.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the feature is making <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/07/hey-spotify-starts-roll-out-iphone/">its way to iOS devices</a>, as well. When we launched the Spotify app here on an iPhone running iOS 14.5, for instance, we found the same feature had indeed gone live. You just tap on the microphone button by the search box to get to the voice experience. We asked around and found that other iPhone users on various versions of the iOS operating system also had the feature, including free users, Premium subscribers and Premium Family Plan subscribers.</p>
<p>The screen that appears suggests in big, bold text that you could be saying <em>&#8220;Hey Spotify, play&#8230;&#8221;</em> followed by a random artist&#8217;s name. It also presents a big green button at the bottom to turn on &#8220;Hey Spotify.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once enabled, you can ask for artists, albums, songs and playlists by name, as well as control playback with commands like stop, pause, skip this song, go back and others. Spotify confirms the command with a robotic-sounding male voice by default. (You can swap to a female voice in Settings, if you prefer.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135491" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135491" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2135491" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Image-from-iOS-12.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135491" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify screenshot iOS</p></div></p>
<p>This screen also alerts users that when the app hears the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice command, it sends the user&#8217;s voice data and other information to Spotify. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/voice-controls/plain/">a link to Spotify policy regarding its use of voice data</a>, which further explains that Spotify will collect recordings and transcripts of what you say along with information about the content it returned to you. The company says it may continue to use this data to improve the feature, develop new voice features and target users with relevant advertising. It may also share your information with service providers, like cloud storage providers.</p>
<p>The policy looks to be the same as the one that was used along with Spotify&#8217;s voice-enabled ads,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/spotify-launches-voice-enabled-ads-on-mobile-devices-in-a-limited-u-s-test/"> launched last year</a>, so it doesn&#8217;t seem to have been updated to fully reflect the changes enabled with the launch of &#8220;Hey Spotify.&#8221; However, it does indicate that, like other voice assistants, Spotify doesn&#8217;t just continuously record &#8212; it waits until users say the wake words.</p>
<p>Given the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice command&#8217;s origins with &#8220;Car Thing,&#8221; there&#8217;s been speculation that the mobile rollout is a signal that the company is poised to launch its own hardware to the wider public in the near future. There&#8217;s already some indication that may be true &#8212; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/02/spotify-ios-app-car-thing-images/">MacRumors recently reported</a> finding references and photos to Car Thing and its various mounts inside the Spotify app&#8217;s code. This follows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231876/spotify-car-thing-fcc-design-screen-pictures-photos">Car Thing&#8217;s reveal in FCC filings</a> back in January of this year, which had also stoked rumors that the device was soon to launch.</p>
<p>Spotify was reached for comment this morning, but has yet been unable to provide any answers about the feature&#8217;s launch despite a day&#8217;s wait. Instead, we were told that they &#8220;unfortunately do not have any additional news to share at this time.&#8221; That further suggests some larger projects could be tied to this otherwise more minor feature&#8217;s launch.</p>

<p>Though today&#8217;s consumers are wary of tech companies&#8217; data collection methods &#8212; and particularly their use of voice data after all <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/amazon-adds-alexa-delete-what-i-said-today-command/">three</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-ordered-to-halt-human-review-of-voice-ai-recordings-over-privacy-risks/">tech</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/siri-recordings-regularly-sent-to-apple-contractors-for-analysis-claims-whistleblower/">giants</a> confessed to poor practices on this front &#8212; there&#8217;s still a use case for voice commands, particularly from an accessibility standpoint and, for drivers, from a safety standpoint.</p>
<p>And although you can direct your voice assistant on your phone (or via CarPlay or Android Auto, if available) to play content from Spotify, some may find it useful to be able to speak to Spotify directly &#8212; especially since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/">Apple doesn&#8217;t allow Spotify to be set as a default music service.</a> You can only<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/"> train Siri to launch Spotify as your preferred service.</a></p>
<p>If, however, you have second thoughts about using the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; feature after enabling it, you can turn it off under &#8220;Voice Interactions&#8221; in the app&#8217;s settings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter held talks with Clubhouse around a potential acquisition of the live drop-in audio networking platform, with a deal value somewhere around $4 billion, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/twitter-is-said-to-have-discussed-4-billion-clubhouse-takeover?sref=gni836kR">report from Bloomberg</a>. TechCrunch has also confirmed the discussions took place from a source familiar with the conversations.</p>
<p>While the talks occurred over the past several months, they&#8217;re no longer taking place, though the reason they ended isn&#8217;t known according to the report. It&#8217;s also worth noting that just a few days ago, Bloomberg reported that Clubhouse was seeking to raise a new round of funding at a valuation of around $4 billion, but the report detailing the potential acquisition talks indicate that the discussions with Twitter collapsed first, leading to a change in strategy to pursue securing additional capital in exchange for equity investment.</p>
<p>Twitter has its own product very similar to Clubhouse — Spaces, a drop-in audio chatroom feature that it has been rolling out gradually to its user base over the past few months. Clubhouse, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">just launched the first of its monetization efforts, Clubhouse Payments,</a> which lets users send direct payments to other creators on the platform, provided that person has enabled receipt of said payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interestingly, the monetization effort from Clubhouse actually doesn&#8217;t provide them with any money; instead, it&#8217;s monetization for recipient users who get 100% of the funds directed their way, minus a small cut for processing that goes directly to Stripe, the payment provider Clubhouse is using to enable the virtual tips.</p>
<p>While we aren&#8217;t privy to the specifics of these talks between Twitter and Clubhouse, it does seem like an awfully high price tag for the social network to pay for the audio app, especially given its own progress with Spaces. Clubhouse&#8217;s early traction has been undeniable, but there are a lot of questions still remaining about its longevity, and it&#8217;s also being cloned left and right by other platforms, begging the age-old startup question of whether it&#8217;s a feature or a product on its own.</p>
<p>Whatever went down, the timing of this revelation seems likely to prime the pump for Clubhouse&#8217;s conversation with potential investors at its target valuation for the round it&#8217;s looking to raise. Regardless, it&#8217;s exciting to have this kind of activity, buzz and attention paid to a consumer software play after many years of what one could argue has been a relatively lackluster period for the category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the classification of ride-hail drivers as &#8220;essential workers&#8221; during the early days of the pandemic, last April </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-05-07/uber-reports-first-ever-decline-in-rides-booked-business-drops-by-80-video"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s business dropped by 80%.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Drivers decided they’d rather not risk contracting or spreading COVID-19 for the measly revenue provided by the few rides per day they were getting, so when the federal CARES Act extended the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance to gig workers, many Uber drivers decided to hang up their keys. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/?sref=a2d7LMhq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than a quarter of the U.S. population already vaccinated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Uber is now in a sticky situation wherein there are more riders requesting trips than there are drivers available. The ride-hailing giant not only wants drivers to know that there’s business to be had once again, but they also want to sweeten the deal with incentives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the company <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/getting-drivers-back-on-the-road/">announced the launch of a $250 million driver stimulus</a> to welcome drivers back into the fold and recruit new ones as the pandemic begins to ease in the U.S. Both returning drivers and new drivers will be receiving bonuses over the coming months, according to an Uber spokesperson.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2020, many drivers stopped driving because they couldn’t count on getting enough trips to make it worth their time,” reads the blog post announcing the stimulus. “In 2021, there are more riders requesting trips than there are drivers available to give them — making it a great time to be a driver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to high rider demand and low supply of drivers, the current median hourly rate for cities like Philadelphia, Austin, Chicago, Miami and Phoenix is $26.66, which is 25% to 75% higher than they were in March of last year. Uber wants drivers to take advantage of the higher earnings now because “this is likely a temporary situation.” Meaning as the country recovers and more gig workers get back behind the wheel, earnings will likely decrease from their current levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stimulus money will go on top of those hourly rates, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. The incentive structure will be based on individual activity, as well as location. For example, in Austin, current drivers are guaranteed $1,100 if they complete 115 trips. In Phoenix, they can earn an extra $1,775 for 200 trips. </span></p>
<div>&#8220;We will have more guarantees coming in both those cities as well as all the other markets we are targeting in the U.S. &#8211; the dollar and trip amounts may just change slightly depending on local factors,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</div>
<p>The money will also go toward guaranteed minimum pay and on-boarding for new Uber drivers, and t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he full $250 million pool is coming directly from Uber’s pockets. The company’s shares declined as much as 3.6% during trading on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is also aiming to help streamline the process of getting drivers vaccinated </span><a href="https://www.insidernj.com/press-release/uber-walgreens-partner-get-covid-19-vaccines-new-jersey-drivers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with an in-app booking portal as part of its partnership with Walgreens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that the example incentives for Austin and Phoenix refer to financial guarantees offered to current drivers in the past few weeks.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest today hosted an event focused on its creator community, where the company announced a series of updates including the launch of a $500,000 Creator Fund, a new content policy called the Creator Code, as well as new moderation tools, among other things. With the changes, the company says its goal is to ensure the platform continues to be an &#8220;inclusive, positive and inspiring place.&#8221; The new content guidelines put that into more specific terms as it requires Pinterest creators to fact-check content, practice inclusion, be kind and ensure any call to action they make via the site doesn&#8217;t cause harm.</p>
<p>Creators will be required to agree and sign the code during the publishing process for Story Pins, where they tap a button that says &#8220;I agree&#8221; to statements that include &#8220;Be kind,&#8221; &#8220;Check my facts,&#8221; &#8220;Be aware of triggers,&#8221; &#8220;Practice inclusion&#8221; and &#8220;Do no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135375" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135375" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135375" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pinterest-Creator-Code-UI.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135375" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The code will be enforced the same way Pinterest today applies its rules for its other content policies: a combination of machine learning and human review, Pinterest tells us. However, the site&#8217;s algorithm will be designed to reward positive content and block harmful content, <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/bringing-authoritative-vaccine-results-to-pinterest-search">like anti-vaccination sentiments,</a> for example. This could have a larger impact on what sort of content is shared on Pinterest, rather than a pop-up agreement with simple statements.</p>
<p>The Creator Code itself is not yet live, but will roll out to creators to sign and adopt in the weeks ahead, Pinterest says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135371" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135371" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Comments-UI.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Pinterest today also introduced several new creator tools focused on the similar goal of making Pinterest a more positive, safe experience for all.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s launching comment moderation tools that will allow creators to remove and filter comments on their content, as well as tools that will allow them to feature up to three comments in the comment feed to highlight positive feedback. New spam prevention tools will help to clear out some of the unwanted comments, too, by leveraging machine learning technology to detect and remove bad comments.</p>
<p>Also new are &#8220;positivity reminders,&#8221; which will pop up asking Pinterest users to reconsider before posting potentially offensive comments. The notification will push users to go back and edit their comment, but doesn&#8217;t prevent them from posting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135373" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135373" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135373" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png 4293w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Creator_Code-Positivity-Nudge.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135373" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>Related to these efforts, Pinterest announced the launch of its first-ever Creator Fund at today&#8217;s event. The fund is specifically focused on elevating creators from underrepresented communities in the United States and will offer a combination of creative strategy consulting and compensating them with budget for content creation and ad credits. At least 50% of the fund&#8217;s recipients will be from underrepresented groups, Pinterest says.</p>
<p>The company tells us it&#8217;s initially committed to giving creators $500,000 in cash and media throughout 2021.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first participants of the program, we worked with eight emerging creators across fashion, photography, food and travel, and will be identifying 10 more creators in the next few months for the next cohort,&#8221; noted Creator Inclusion Lead Alexandra Nikolajev.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re on a journey to build a globally inclusive platform where Pinners and Creators around the world can discover ideas that feel personalized, relevant and reflective of who they are,&#8221; Nikolajev said.</p>
<p>Pinterest has been working to rebuild its image in the wake of last year&#8217;s allegations of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/pinterest-employees-are-walking-out-today-in-light-of-discrimination-allegations/">a host of internal issues,</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/former-pinterest-employees-allege-unfair-pay-racism-and-retaliation.html">including unfair pay, racism, retaliation</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/">and sexism</a>, which conflicted with its outside image of being one of the &#8220;nicer&#8221; places to work in tech. Despite this fallout &#8212; which included a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/">lawsuit</a>, employee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/pinterest-employees-are-walking-out-today-in-light-of-discrimination-allegations/">walkout</a>, <a href="https://www.coworker.org/petitions/put-an-end-to-all-forms-of-discrimination-and-retaliation-at-pinterest-1">petitions</a> and more &#8212; the issues that had been raised weren&#8217;t always reflected in Pinterest&#8217;s product.</p>

<p>The company had previously launched inclusive features like &#8220;skin tone ranges&#8221; to help those shopping for beauty products find matches for their skin tone. It also allowed retailers and brands to identify themselves as members of an underrepresented group, which gave their content the ability to appear in more places across Pinterest&#8217;s platform, like the Today tab, Shopping Spotlights and The Pinterest Shop, for instance.</p>
<p>Evan Sharp, Pinterest&#8217;s co-founder and Chief Design and Creative Officer, referenced the company&#8217;s image as &#8220;a positive place&#8221; at today&#8217;s event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been building Pinterest for 11 years, and ever since our users routinely tell us that Pinterest is the &#8216;last positive corner of the internet.&#8217; In that time, we’ve also learned that you need to design positivity into online platforms as deliberately as much as you design negativity out,&#8221; Sharp said. &#8220;The Creator Code is a human-centric way for Creators to understand how to be successful on Pinterest while using their voice to keep Pinterest positive and inclusive,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Today, Pinterest serves over 450 million users worldwide, but is challenged by large platforms serving creators like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and others, including newcomers like TikTok and those that are inching into the creator community with funds of their own, like Snapchat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">which is paying creators for Spotlight content,</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">Clubhouse, which is now funding creators&#8217; shows</a>. The increased competition for creator interest has left Pinterest needing an incentive program of its own.</p>
<p>To kick of its announcement, Pinterest’s Head of Content and Creator Partnerships, Aya Kanai, interviewed television personality <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/jvnpins/_saved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/jvnpins/_saved/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617889288544000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRK_HxBH9eOgI5VHqfnrhuIrVdGw">Jonathan Van Ness</a> (Queer Eye) at today&#8217;s virtual event, where they talked about the need for positivity and inclusivity on social media.

					<description><![CDATA[Cybersecurity veteran Katie Moussouris explains what startups should (and shouldn't) do, what to prioritize, and the difference between vulnerability disclosure, penetration testing and bug bounties.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the rush to launch, cybersecurity doesn&#8217;t always get the attention it deserves, and yet it&#8217;s one of the first things that startups learn can — and will — go wrong.</p>
<p>Hacker and security researchers can be some of your biggest assets in helping your startup stay secure. Vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs are part of working with the hacker community to build a stronger, more resilient company. But these are not a replacement for security investments, which as a growing company you should not overlook.</p>
<p>Katie Moussouris has been in cybersecurity circles since some of the world&#8217;s biggest tech companies were startups, and helped to set up the first vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs. Moussouris, who runs consultancy firm Luta Security, now advises companies and governments on how to talk to hackers and what they need to do to build and improve their vulnerability disclosure programs.</p>
<p>At TC Early Stage, Moussouris explained what startups should (and shouldn&#8217;t) do, and what priorities should come first.</p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Knowing the basics</strong></h2>
<p>A bug bounty alone is not enough, and outsourcing the process to a platform isn&#8217;t going to save you time. Moussouris explained the basics and what differs between vulnerability disclosure, penetration testing and bug bounties.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vulnerability disclosure is the process by which you hear about vulnerability from the outside. You digest that vulnerability somehow internally in your organization and figure out what to do with it — whether to create a patch, how to prioritize that patch, and then what to release to the public [ … ] What it comes down to is that organizations need guidelines on how to handle these issues appropriately.</p>
<p>Next we&#8217;ve got penetration testing: hiring professional hackers under contract [who have] a specific set of skills that match your problem set, and you pay them. They&#8217;re under a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) to keep your vulnerabilities secret for as long as you need them — perhaps forever — and you are at your leisure as to whether or not you fix those vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Finally, bug bounties are simply adding a cash reward to the process of vulnerability disclosure programs. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 3:20)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare insurance, if you’re lucky to have it, only covers a subset of conditions in the United States. As a result, patients can often get burdened with horror story charges, like huge deductibles, out-of-network costs and expensive co-pays. So for the uninsured and insured alike, innovative ways of managing big bills are in high demand &#8212; especially as uncertainty remains around<a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyfarr/status/1379566792830377985"> how COVID-19 and long-haul symptoms will be handled by patients and payers. </a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hellowalnut.com/">Walnut</a>, founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roshan--patel/">Roshan Patel</a>, is a point-of-sale lending company with a healthcare twist. Walnut uses a “buy now, pay later” model, popularized by Affirm and Klarna, to help patients pay for healthcare over a period of time, instead of in one $3,000 chunk. Walnut works with healthcare providers so that a patient’s bill can be paid back through $100-a-month increments for 30 months, instead of one aggressive credit card swipe.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135319" style="width: 578px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135319" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2135319" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg 4128w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/product-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135319" class="wp-caption-text">A patient using Walnut to pay healthcare bills. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walnut</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a sweet deal, but Patel added one more detail that he thinks makes Walnut stand out: The startup doesn’t charge any interest or fees to consumers.</p>
<p>“Almost every ‘buy now, pay later’ company in e-commerce charges interest or fees, and every personal loan provider charges interest or fees, but we do not,” he said. “And that&#8217;s really important to me, not making healthcare any more expensive than it already is. It’s a very patient-friendly product.”</p>
<p>Companies that use the buy now, pay later model with zero interest or fees need to make revenue somehow, and in Walnut’s case it is by charging healthcare providers a percentage of each sale or transaction.</p>
<p>If a provider’s collection rate for an out-of-pocket is 50%, Walnut would go to them and say “give us a 40% discount, and we’ll guarantee the cash for you upfront.” The startup will take the risk, and then the provider is able to make 60% of the collection rate.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="r88OWk8juw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/healthcare-entrepreneurs-should-prepare-for-an-upcoming-vc-pe-bubble/">Healthcare entrepreneurs should prepare for an upcoming VC/PE bubble</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Healthcare entrepreneurs should prepare for an upcoming VC/PE bubble&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/healthcare-entrepreneurs-should-prepare-for-an-upcoming-vc-pe-bubble/embed/#?secret=r88OWk8juw" data-secret="r88OWk8juw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, ideally, a provider would want to get 100% of payments they are owed, but that is wishful thinking. Patel explained that a large number of bills go unpaid due to bankruptcies or a default on payments (the average collections rate for hospitals out of pocket is less than 20%). Because of this, a company like Walnut has room to offer at least some stable upfront cash to hospitals, even if it ends up being 60% of overall bills versus 100%.</p>
<p>The company uses “extensive underwriting models” to figure out if a patient should qualify for a loan. Patel says that the startup goes beyond using credit score, which he describes as an “outdated metric”, and instead looks at thousands of data points from different providers, from side hustle income to spending habits on things like groceries and bills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1308296" style="width: 734px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1308296" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1308296" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg 3817w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=768,566 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=680,501 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=1536,1132 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=2048,1509 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/insurance-e1530627709458.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1308296" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-540784p1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightspring <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Walnut’s biggest challenge, says Patel, is to underwrite the population and pay the healthcare provider upfront in cash. It then collects from the patient on the back end, which comes with its own amount of risk.</p>
<p>“To be able to take on that risk for patients that are less credit-worthy is a very challenging problem, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really solved yet in healthcare,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup is starting by working with small private practices of one to five physicians that focus on specialties like dentistry, dermatology and fertility.</p>
<p>A big part of Walnut’s success will be determined by if it can attract people that truly need flexible financing options. For example, the company doesn&#8217;t have any hospitals as a partner yet, which would tap a larger group of patients that likely need flexible financing options the most. Right now, “the people who get elective-care surgery are the ones that can afford it.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Making sense of Klarna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/embed/#?secret=gIAGD8QkZM" data-secret="gIAGD8QkZM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But Patel doesn’t see this as a disconnect; instead, he sees it as an opportunity to widen access to elective medical care to more people.</p>
<p>“I talked to a person last week who has no teeth and wants dentures but it costs $6,000,” he said. “That person should be able to afford it, and we enabled them to pay $100 a month for it.”</p>
<p>Walnut’s two biggest customer groups are the uninsured (people who have lost their jobs from COVID-19), and consumers who have high deductible plans.</p>
<p>Walnut isn’t the first. PrimaHealth Credit, Walnut’s closest competitor, offers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/primahealth-credit-offers-a-buy-now-pay-later-lending-service-for-elective-procedures/"> point-of-sale lending procedures </a>for elective medical procedures. Think surgeries like cataract work or dental work. The company said the service is currently available in Arizona, California, Florida, Oklahoma and Texas, and will be expanded to all 50 states this year. Walnut, comparatively, is mostly focused on the East Coast and plans to expand nationwide by the end of this year.</p>
<p>PrimaHealth’s average loan size is $1,800, and Walnut’s average loan size is $5,000.</p>
<p>The company is currently piloting with a handful of healthcare providers in dermatology, dentistry and fertility. It has had more than 500 patient loan applications, totaling over $4.6 million in application volume year-to-date. Patel says that Walnut only accepted a fraction of these applications, but declined to share what percent of money it has lent so far. As Walnut refines its model, it might be able to cover other categories.</p>
<p>Up until this point, Walnut has been lending off of its own balance sheet. In order to truly scale, it will need to get a new source of capital &#8212; either a credit line, debt financing round or venture capital &#8212; to offer more loans. Patel says that the startup is in talks with banks, and turned down a debt offer due to size and rate.</p>
<p>Venture capital seems to be the solution for now: The startup announced that it has raised a $3.6 million seed round from investors including Gradient Ventures, Afore Capital, 2048 Ventures, Supernode Ventures, TA Ventures, Polymath Capital, Tack Ventures, Awesome People Ventures, Newark Ventures and NKM Capital. Angels include the CEOs of Giphy and PillPack, and the CTO of Rampm Financial as well as an NFL coach. The company is also a part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/plaid-accelerator-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-fintech-startups/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Plaid&#8217;s inaugural accelerator.</a></p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t want to be yet another startup trying to offer you an undifferentiated insurance plan,” Patel said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitch will start holding its streamers to a higher standard. The company just expanded its hate and harassment policy, specifying more kinds of bad behavior that break its rules and could result in a ban from the streaming service.</p>
<p>The news comes as Twitch continues to grapple with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303185/twitch-sexual-harassment-assault-permanent-bans-streamers">reports of abusive behavior and sexual harassment,</a> both on the platform and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-08-twitch-staff-call-the-company-out-on-sexual-assault-racism-more">within the company itself</a>. In December, Twitch<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/"> released an updated set of rules</a> designed to take harassment and abuse more seriously, admitting that women, people of color and the LGBTQ+ community were impacted by a &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; amount of that toxic behavior on the platform.</p>
<p>Twitch&#8217;s policies now include serious offenses that could pose a safety threat, even when they happen entirely away from the streaming service. Those threats include violent extremism, terrorism, threats of mass violence, sexual assault and ties to known hate groups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will also continue to evaluate off-platform behavior in cases that happen on Twitch, like an on-stream situation that leads to harassment on Twitter or Facebook.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitch updates its hateful content and harassment policy after company called out for its own abuses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/embed/#?secret=UAdcAuoydV" data-secret="UAdcAuoydV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;While this policy is new, we have taken action historically against serious, clear misconduct that took place off service, but until now, we didn’t have an approach that scaled,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, adding that investigating off-platform behavior requires additional resources to address the complexity inherent in those cases.</p>
<p>To handle reports for its broadened rules, Twitch created a dedicated email address (OSIT@twitch.tv) to handle reports about off-service behavior. The company says it has partnered with a third-party investigative law firm to vet the reports it receives.</p>
<p>Twitch cites its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/"> actions against former President Donald Trump</a> as the most high-profile instance of off-platform behavior resulting in enforcement. The company disabled Trump&#8217;s account following the attack on the U.S. Capitol and later suspended him indefinitely, citing fears that he could use the service to incite violence.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to have a higher profile than the president, but Trump isn&#8217;t the only big time banned Twitch user. Last June, Twitch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">kicked one of its biggest streamers off of the platform</a> without providing an explanation for the decision.</p>
<p>Going on a year later, no one seems to know why Dr. Disrespect got the boot from Twitch, though the company&#8217;s insistence that it only acts in cases with a &#8220;preponderance of evidence&#8221; suggests his violations were serious and well corroborated.</p>

Up to this point, the company has been known for its identity access management product, giving companies the ability to sign onto multiple cloud products with a single sign on. Today, the company is moving into two new areas: privileged access and identity governance</p>
<p>Privileged access gives companies the ability to provide access on an as-needed basis to a limited number of people to key administrative services inside a company. This could be your database or your servers or any part of your technology stack that is highly sensitive and where you want to tightly control who can access these systems.</p>
<p>Okta CEO Todd McKinnon says that Okta has always been good at locking down the general user population access to cloud services like Salesforce, Office 365 and Gmail. What these cloud services have in common is you access them via a web interface.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Administrators access the speciality accounts using different protocols. &#8220;It&#8217;s something like secure shell, or you&#8217;re using a terminal on your computer to connect to a server in the cloud, or it&#8217;s a database connection where you&#8217;re actually logging in with a SQL connection, or you&#8217;re connecting to a container, which is the Kubernetes protocol to actually manage the container,&#8221; McKinnon explained.</p>
<p>Privileged access offers a couple of key features including the ability to limit access to a given time window and to record a video of the session so there is an audit trail of exactly what happened while someone was accessing the system. McKinnon says that these features provide additional layers of protection for these sensitive accounts.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Okta COVID-19 app usage report finds it&#8217;s not just collaboration seeing a huge uptick&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/okta-covid-19-app-usage-report-finds-its-not-just-collaboration-seeing-a-huge-uptick/embed/#?secret=LMl67AHZcj" data-secret="LMl67AHZcj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He says that it will be fairly trivial to carve out these accounts because Okta already has divided users into groups and can give these special privileges to only those people in the administrative access group. The challenge was figuring out how to get access to these other kinds of protocols.</p>
<p>The governance piece provides a way for security operations teams to run detailed reports and look for issues related to identity. &#8220;Governance provides exception reporting so you can give that to your auditors, and more importantly you can give that to your security team to make sure that you figure out what&#8217;s going on and why there is this deviation from your stated policy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>All of this when combined with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/">the $6.5 billion acquisition of Auth0 last month</a> is part of a larger plan by the company to be what McKinnon calls the identity cloud. He sees a market with several strategic clouds and he believes identity is going to be one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because identity is so strategic for everything, it&#8217;s unlocking your customer, access, it&#8217;s unlocking your employee access, it&#8217;s keeping everything secure. And so this expansion, whether it&#8217;s customer identity with zero trust or whether it&#8217;s doing more on the workforce identity with not just access, but privileged access and identity governance. It&#8217;s about identity evolving in this primary cloud,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While both of these new products were announced today at the company&#8217;s virtual Oktane customer conference, they won&#8217;t be generally available until the first quarter of next year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Zoom Chief Revenue Officer Ryan Azus gives tips on when founders should step aside from leading their startup's sales org, how to build a working sales culture, hiring diversely and more.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">Early Stage</a>, TechCrunch spoke with Zoom Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanazus/">Ryan Azus</a> about building an early-stage sales team. Azus is perhaps best known for leading the video-calling giant&#8217;s income arm during COVID-19, but his experience building RingCentral&#8217;s North American sales organization from the ground up made him the perfect guest to chat with about building an early-stage sales team.</p>
<p>We asked him about when founders should step aside from leading their startup&#8217;s sales org, how to build a working sales culture, hiring diversely, how to pick customer segments and how to build a playbook.</p>
<p>Below, TechCrunch has compiled a number of key comments from Azus, and afterward we&#8217;ve included the full video from the interview as well as a transcript. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<hr />
<h2>When should founders let others run sales?</h2>
<p>Nearly every startup leans on its CEO as its first salesperson. After all, who else knows the product and can talk it up like the startup&#8217;s leader? But having the CEO as point-person for sales scales poorly. So, when is the right time to have someone else step in?</p>
<blockquote><p>Fairly early on. First off, CEOs need to solve customer needs. And so it&#8217;s important to be very hands-on for a while to really understand while you&#8217;re trying to figure out product-market fit. And then bringing in some of those sales people as you start seeing something [good].</p>
<p>Part of it is also knowing what type of salesperson you need. [ … ] Who is your core audience? What persona are you going after? And trying to find people that know and understand selling something that&#8217;s primarily very transactional to small businesses, [or] e-commerce lead, or selling something that&#8217;s more enterprise &#8212; those are different animals, different segments that you&#8217;re going after. One mistake [startups make] is hiring the wrong type of salesperson.<em><strong> (Time stamp: 5:29)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>At the top of the list are a pair of e-bikes, produced by VanMoof. The S3 and X3 will sport tracking functionality, along with a “Locate with Apple Find My” logo located on the bottom side of the crossbar. Belkin’s Soundform Freedom earbuds, meanwhile, will join Apple’s iPods in sporting the feature, while the Chipolo ONE Spot will beat the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">long-rumored AirTags</a> to the punch.</p>
<p>According to Apple, the new products are set to hit the market next week. There are a bunch of different privacy concerns laid out by Apple in the white papers, along with other specifications companies will have to adhere to. Interestingly, among the prerequisites is that a device needs to be able to emit sound in order to use the functionality. That&#8217;s pretty straightforward for things like earbuds, but the also means that things like the e-bikes need to make a sounds specifically for this purpose.</p>
<p>Draft specs for chip makers will also be released in the spring, so companies can utilize the Ultra Wideband tech on Apple devices sporting a U1 chip. That should improve directional tracking, among other potential benefits. Approved products will be able to display the aforementioned “Works with Apple Find My” badge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building and maintaining a successful startup requires founders to see the entire playing field. Without that clear view, founders risk missteps when it comes to hiring, raising funds, launching a product or making an acquisition.</p>
<p>Essentially, any big decision can end in disaster if a founder loses perspective or lacks situational and self-awareness.</p>
<p>Eghosa Omoigui, the founder and managing general partner of <a href="http://www.echovc.com/">EchoVC Partners</a>, a seed and early-stage venture capital firm that serves underrepresented founders and underserved markets, has helped entrepreneurs navigate the first steps of starting a company and laying the right foundation early on.</p>
<p>Omoigui, who was previously director of consumer internet and semantic technologies at Intel Capital, advocates for founders to develop their own All-22 tape — a tool used by professional football coaches that allows the viewer to see all 22 players on the field at the same time. It improves a coach’s line of sight and, most importantly, helps avoid missing a critical motion or player.</p>
<p>The concept of this tool can — and should — be applied in the startup world as well, Omoigui said during the virtual TC Early Stage event.</p>
<p>Omoigui explained what it means to have an All-22 tape and the steps founders should take to develop a skillset that will allow them to see and understand the playbook from all sides.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The big picture</h2>
<p>Before getting into the steps, it&#8217;s important to understand what the aim is. The upshot? For founders to have the best and most complete view of their company, team, investors, product and competitors.</p>
<p>For founders, that means being able to zoom out and see each of their employees’ points of view and being inclusive. Without an All-22 tape, founders can mistakenly spend too much on engineering while ignoring the product rollout strategy or forget to communicate with employees outside of their bubble of interest. A company can become fragmented as more blind spots emerge, which can ultimately lead to oversights that damage its reputation, operations or even its ability to raise money from investors.</p>
<blockquote><p>For operators and investors, what we see is usually very driven by where we stand, or where we sit. And what you have to discover really is: How can I get much better views? And the best view is always the plan view, you&#8217;re looking from the top down, you&#8217;re watching the movement, and you have line of sight, you know, that&#8217;s essentially 360 degrees. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 3:40)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h2>Situational and self-awareness</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s internal R&amp;D group, NPE Team, has today launched its latest experiment, <a href="https://hotline.co/">Hotline</a>, into public beta testing. The web-based application could be described as a mashup of Instagram Live and Clubhouse, as it allows creators to speak to an audience who can then ask questions through either text or audio. However, unlike Clubhouse, creators can opt to turn their cameras on for the event, instead of being audio-only.</p>
<p>Real estate investor <a href="https://twitter.com/sweatystartup">Nick Huber</a> is the first to <a href="https://hotline.co/nick-huber-ama">publicly try out the product</a> with a livestream today that began at 10 AM PT (1 PM ET). Huber represents the sort of creator Facebook wants to work with for Hotline, Facebook told us, which is someone who helps people expand their professional skills or their finances. In Huber&#8217;s case, he&#8217;s talking about investing in industrial real estate as a second income stream.</p>

<p>&mdash; Nick Huber (@sweatystartup) <a href="https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1379841706112253959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At Facebook, Hotline is being led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-hazzard-4013038/">Eric Hazzard</a>, who joined Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/facebook-acquires-anonymous-teen-compliment-app-tbh-will-let-it-run/">when it acquired his app tbh</a>, a positivity-focused Q&amp;A app that grew to 2.5 million daily active users in nine weeks and saw over 1 billion poll answers before exiting. With Hotline, Hazzard is once again developing a product in the Q&amp;A space.</p>
<p>But this time, the new app is taking inspiration from an up-and-coming social network, Clubhouse. In fact, Hotline&#8217;s user interface will look familiar to anyone who&#8217;s already used Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces or any of the other audio-only social networks, when it&#8217;s viewed on mobile. At the top on mobile (or to the left side on desktop), there&#8217;s a speaker section where the event host is featured in a round profile icon or live video stream. Below (or to the side on desktop) are the event&#8217;s listeners.</p>
<p>But there are also several differences between Hotline and existing apps, like Clubhouse.</p>

<p>For starters, the app today has users sign in with Twitter then verify their identity via SMS.</p>
<p>The listeners&#8217; section, for example, is divided up between those who are just watching the event, as represented by their profile icons, and those who are asking questions. At the top of this section, you&#8217;re presented with the lists of questions that users have asked, which others can upvote or downvote accordingly. The creator can then look to this section to find out which questions to answer next and can pull listeners onto the stage area with them for a conversation.</p>
<p>At present, users can type in their questions, then join the host &#8220;on stage,&#8221; when it&#8217;s their turn. Currently, guests are represented by their profile icon and are audio only when on stage. But in the settings, there&#8217;s an option for the listener to toggle on video that&#8217;s not yet functional for today&#8217;s test.</p>
<p>As the questions are asked, users can react with emoji including clapping hands, fire, heart, laughter, surprise and thumbs up.</p>

<p>Hosts have full control over the experience, and can remove inappropriate questions from the queue or remove people from their Hotline session. For the initial tests, Facebook employees will moderate events and remove anyone that violates Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJ30EgMPODDC-Aups2x0mJy8U5dg">Community Standards</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/terms.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsHqb8hN2BzLuSbS6bA7tB-ox1vA">Terms of Service</a>, <a href="https://m.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://m.facebook.com/policy.php&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHccirPpdR5TwwMLBGTxi7WDlHh4A">Data Policy</a> or the <a href="https://npe.facebook.com/supplement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://npe.facebook.com/supplement/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617887929140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNETZ0N-JaxiACdVeb5ehVcPtC4FCg">NPE Team&#8217;s Supplemental Terms.</a></p>
<p>Another notable difference between Hotline and Clubhouse is that Hotline events are recorded.</p>
<p>Today, Clubhouse favors more casual chats where people understand there&#8217;s no transcript or recording taking place (unless indicated by the host in the room&#8217;s title). This, Clubhouse believes, allows participants to speak more freely and with less fear. But Hotline automatically produces recordings. After the event, the host will receive two recordings of the session &#8212; one as an mp3 and another as an mp4. The creator can then upload these to other networks, like YouTube or Facebook, edit them into short-form content for apps like TikTok or turn the audio recording into a podcast, or anything else.</p>
<p>At launch, anyone can join a Hotline for free and there&#8217;s no limit on audience size, though this could change as the experiment progresses.</p>
<p>Despite the similarities with Clubhouse, Hotline has a different vibe because of its use of video, text-based questions, upvoting and because it&#8217;s recorded. This makes it feel less like a casual hangout and more like a professional event where an expert is leading a session and inviting an audience to ask questions.</p>

<p>Hotline <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is now one of several apps that Facebook&#8217;s NPE team has launched in the creator space to experiment with different ideas around audio and video. The group is continuing to test </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/facebook-building-tool-to-let-fans-pay-celebrities-for-face-time">a creator app called Super</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, similar to Cameo, which is web-based and entirely video. It also previously tested </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-launches-catchup-an-audio-only-group-calling-app-that-shows-whos-ready-to-chat-now/">an audio-only calling app, CatchUp</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which shut down last year, as well as </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/facebook-takes-on-twitter-with-venue-a-second-screen-companion-for-live-events/">another Q&amp;A product known as Venue</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which is more of a Twitter-like companion for live events. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More recently, it has launched TikTok-esque video apps </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/facebook-launches-collab-a-mix-and-match-app-for-making-collaborative-music-videos/">Collab</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/facebook-launches-bars-a-tiktok-like-app-for-creating-and-sharing-raps/">BARS</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which focused on collaborative music and raps, respectively.  </span></p>
<p>Over time, the goal of NPE projects isn&#8217;t necessarily to stand them up on their own as individual apps &#8212; though that could happen, if they gained enough traction. More broadly, the learnings from the tests and experiments can help inform future Facebook product development, as it builds out new features for existing products, like Messenger Rooms or Facebook Live, among other things.</p>
<p>Facebook didn&#8217;t make an official announcement about Hotline&#8217;s launch, but offered a statement about today&#8217;s test.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Hotline, we’re hoping to understand how interactive, live multimedia Q&amp;As can help people learn from experts in areas like professional skills, just as it helps those experts build their businesses,&#8221; a spokesperson said. &#8220;New Product Experimentation has been testing multimedia products like CatchUp, Venue, Collab, and BARS, and we’re encouraged to see the formats continue to help people connect and build community,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Hotline isn&#8217;t Facebook&#8217;s only attempt to challenge Clubhouse. The company is also in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">developing a Clubhouse rival</a> within the Messenger Rooms product experience, Facebook recently confirmed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.kavak.com/">Kavak</a>, the Mexican startup that’s disrupted the used car market in Mexico and Argentina, today announced its Series D of $485 million, which now values the company at $4 billion. This round more than triples their previous valuation of $1.15 billion, which established them as a unicorn just a couple of months ago in October of 2020. Kavak is now one of the top five highest-valued startups in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by D1 Capital Partners, Founders Fund, Ribbit and BOND, and brings Kavak’s total capital raised to date to more than $900 million. Kavak recently soft-launched in Brazil, and this new round of funding will be used to build out the Brazilian market and beyond, said Carlos García Ottati, Kavak’s CEO and co-founder. The company plans to do a full launch in Brazil in the next 60 days, García said, and we can expect to see Kavak in markets outside Latin America in the next 24 months, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were built to solve emerging market problems,” García said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kavak, which was founded in 2016, is an online marketplace that aims to bring transparency, security and access to financing to the used car market. The company also offers its own financing through its fintech arm, Kavak Capital, and counts more than 2,500 employees and 20 logistics and reconditioning hubs in Mexico and Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Latin America, 90% of the [used car] transactions are informal, which leads to a 40% fraud rate,” said García, who experienced these challenges firsthand when he moved to Mexico from Colombia a couple of years ago and bought a used car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My budget allowed me to buy a used car, but there was no infrastructure around it. It took me six months to buy the car, and then the car had legal and mechanical issues and I lost most of my money,” he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kavak buys cars from individuals, refurbishes them and offers warranties to buyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Instead of buying a new car, they can buy a better car that still has all the warranties. It’s a really aspirational process,” said García. The company, which really amounts to four companies in one given its areas of focus, was built to be comprehensive by design in order to meet the various gaps in the market, García said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re building a business here [Latin America], you need to build several businesses because so many things are broken,” he said. That&#8217;s why the financing option, for example, has been a key to their success, according to García.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financing has traditionally been hard to come by in Brazil, and as García said, the used car market lacks infrastructure there, too. That being said, Brazil is Latin America’s fintech hub, and the space has made leaps and bounds over the last 7-10 years with companies such as Nubank, PagSeguro, Creditas, PicPay, and others leading the way. As a result, credit cards and loans are more widely available today in the region, offering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">competition for Kavak Capital. While Kavak has localized some of its product for the Brazilian market — namely building out a Portuguese language version of the app and website — García said the markets are very similar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Brazil, you still have the same problems that you have in Mexico, but Brazil is a little more developed, especially in fintech, which is light years ahead of Mexico,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Brazilian product heading to the races, García said they already have plans for other regions, though he declined to name them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“80% of people in emerging markets don’t have access to a car,” García said of the global market size. “We want to go into big markets where customers are facing similar problems and where Kavak can really change their lives,” he added.</span></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>My startup registered two H-1B candidates in this year’s lottery. Sadly, neither was selected. </strong></p>
<p><strong>One is my co-founder, the other is on OPT. Help! We can’t afford for them to have to leave the U.S. What are our options?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Lost in Los Angeles</strong></p>
<p>Dear Lost:</p>
<p>Take a deep breath; I’ve got your back. There are many creative immigration pathways for you, your co-founder and your <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/opt-optional-practical-training/">F-1 OPT</a> employee to explore. We’ll take a look at several options, and you can also check out my recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/065-selected-or-not-selected-in-the-h-1b-lottery-now-what/">podcast</a> in which my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-zaidi-b3a40414/">Nadia Zaidi</a> and I explain them in greater depth.</p>
<p>I hope the below ideas inspire you and fill you with a sense of hope and possibility. As always, I suggest consulting with an experienced immigration attorney who can help you identify the strongest path forward, as well as backup options for your co-founder and employee. The particular immigration strategy that’s best for you is always an individual determination. It’s best identified through a personal consultation with an attorney such as myself based on a variety of factors, including each person’s immigration history and your particular startup’s goals.</p>
<h2>Co-founder immigration options</h2>
<p>For a funded startup, there’s a great H-1B Plan B: the Cap-Exempt H-1B. Especially if your co-founder has a STEM background (and possibly even for some founders who don’t have this), there’s a wonderful new triple-win option that supports startups, international candidates and even diverse U.S. STEM college students seeking better project-based learning opportunities.</p>
<p>What is this magical rainbow-striped unicorn option, you ask? Well, here’s the legal background: Some employers qualify to petition for an H-1B visa at any time without going through the lottery. These employers — called cap-exempt employers because they are not subject to the annual H-1B cap of 85,000 visas available to for-profit employers — include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutions of higher education.</li>
<li>Nonprofits tied to institutions of higher education.</li>
<li>Nonprofit research organizations.</li>
<li>Government research organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your co-founder can get a part-time H-1B visa through one of these cap-exempt employers, your startup can concurrently sponsor your co-founder for an H-1B regardless of the recent lottery results.</p>

<p>To take advantage of this special law, I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org/">Open Avenues Foundation</a>, which offers a <a href="https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org/global-talent">Global Talent Fellowship</a>. In this program, international talent can receive cap-exempt H-1B visas by leading university students for about five hours a week in real-world, project-based work within their field of expertise for the startup that nominated them for the fellowship. The candidate gets to stay in (or come to) the U.S., your startup gets a team of students working on a group project that benefits your company and increases diversity in your hiring pipeline, and U.S. students get the benefit of hands-on high quality STEM learning.</p>
<p>Once your candidate’s first cap-exempt H-1B is in place, your startup can petition for a second, concurrent Cap-Exempt H-1B for direct startup employment.</p>
<p>Interested in variations? If you’re not in STEM but have a university that would host you (free to the university), you can potentially partner with OAF. In addition, many universities in the U.S have <a href="https://www.globaleir.org/">global entrepreneur-in-residence programs</a> that can help international co-founders qualify for concurrent Cap-Exempt H-1Bs. Your startup should also consider sponsoring your co-founder for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">O-1A visa</a> or change of status.</p>
<p>Another option to consider is for your co-founder to apply for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/entrepreneur-parole/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP), a new 30-month immigration status in the U.S. The International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) was created by President Barack Obama and is the closest thing the U.S. has right now to a startup visa. The Trump administration tried to eliminate it, but the <a href="https://nvca.org/immigration/">National Venture Capital Association</a>, led by Jeff Farrah, successfully challenged the administration’s effort in federal court, so IEP remains on the books.</p>
<p>A lot of folks don’t believe it’s an option yet, so I’m currently looking for international startup founders with a strong case to file for IEP to test out this new program and demonstrate its existence to the world. We’re currently seeking global startup founders holding at least 15% equity in a U.S. startup that’s less than five years old and has raised at least $250,000 from U.S. investors. If you want to be on our free interest list, you can fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmpTCXBjdaZkGF_fMlEnDVdmD114lm8pH9R24iOKaE1znwEQ/viewform">form</a>. If we think you have a strong application, we’ll reach out.</p>
<p>If your co-founder wants to remain permanently in the U.S., consider starting a green card now such as the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">EB-1A</a> green card for individuals of extraordinary ability or an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">EB-2 NIW</a> (National Interest Waiver) green card for individuals of exceptional ability. Of these, the EB-1A is the quickest option, but its qualification requirements are tougher than for the EB-2 NIW.</p>
<h2>F-1 OPT employee immigration options</h2>
<p>If your F-1 OPT employee graduated with a qualified STEM degree, that employee can apply for a 24-month work extension, known as <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/stem-opt-extension/">STEM OPT</a>. That will allow the employee to remain in the U.S. to continue working for you. In the meantime, you can register them again next year for the H-1B lottery. If there’s no possibility for STEM, please check out the Cap-Exempt H-1B option explained above.</p>
<p>If your F-1 OPT employee only has a bachelor’s degree, they might want to consider pursuing an advanced degree. Individuals with a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. university have better odds of being selected in the annual H-1B lottery. That’s because 20,000 of the 85,000 H-1B visas available each year are earmarked for individuals with a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. university.</p>
<p>You should be aware, however, that next year’s H-1B lottery will likely shift from the current random selection process to one based on the highest wages. Unless the Biden administration changes the policy, which was devised by the previous administration, employers who pay their H-1B candidates a Level III wage or higher have the best chance of getting selected to file for an H-1B visa.</p>
<p>As you know, sponsoring employers must agree to pay an H-1B candidate the higher of either the actual wage paid for the job or the prevailing wage, which is broken down into four levels based on experience required for the position and location of the position. Level I wage is basically for an entry-level position, while a Level IV wage is for a position requiring the most experience. While this will add greater predictability to the annual H-1B “lottery,” early-stage startups and small businesses may have a difficult time competing against more established companies on salary, particularly because stock options and equity are not included in the salary calculation.</p>
<p>If you need to find alternative visa solutions, you can always consult with an attorney. I hope all of these options help you realize the control and agency you have in this situation. You have choices!</p>
<p>All my best,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the pandemic arrived in the U.S. early last year, companies scrambled to figure out what to do with their long-standing, in-person developer events. For Apple and Microsoft, that meant going virtual — something companies have done with mixed results.</p>
<p>For Google, it meant calling off I/O all together. The company canceled the developer conference traditionally held each May at Mountain View, California’s Shoreline Amphitheater.</p>
<p>“Out of concern for the health and safety of our developers, employees and local communities — and in line with recent ‘shelter in place’ orders by the local Bay Area counties — we sadly will not be holding I/O in any capacity this year,” the company wrote at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After a year off, the show is set to return in virtual form. Google sent out its customary puzzle invites today, noting that the event will be held May 18-20. (Props <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/07/google-i-o-2021-announced/">to 9 to 5 Google for solving.</a>) Like other online-only events of a recent vintage, this version of the developer&#8217;s conference will be free to attend and open to all. (Live, we assume, and not &#8220;Olive,&#8221; but it&#8217;s hard to say for sure, based on the graphic below.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135252" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135252" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2135252" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="627" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png 1682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=768,470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=1536,941 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-12.52.36-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135252" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google joins a number of companies continuing to hold virtual events in 2021. While an aggressive vaccine rollout has begun here in the States, there&#8217;s still plenty of questions and concerns surround the virus&#8217; spread at large gatherings &#8212; even ones like I/O, which are traditionally held outdoors. Apple recently announced a second virtual version of WWDC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/apples-wwdc-stays-online-only-kicking-off-june-7/">set for June</a>, while Microsoft&#8217;s<a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/"> Build runs May 25-27</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The question of whether Facebook will face any regulatory sanction over the latest massive historical platform privacy fail to come to light remains unclear. But the timeline of the incident looks increasingly awkward for the tech giant.</p>
<p>While it initially sought to play down the data breach revelations published by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4">Business Insider</a> at the weekend by suggesting that information like people&#8217;s birth dates and phone numbers was &#8220;old&#8221;, in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/facts-on-news-reports-about-facebook-data/">blog post</a> late yesterday the tech giant finally revealed that the data in question had in fact been scraped from its platform by malicious actors &#8220;in 2019&#8221; and &#8220;prior to September 2019&#8221;.</p>
<p>That new detail about the timing of this incident raises the issue of compliance with Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; which came into application in May 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Under the EU regulation data controllers can face fines of up to 2% of their global annual turnover for failures to notify breaches, and up to 4% of annual turnover for more serious compliance violations.</p>
<p>The European framework looks important because Facebook indemnified itself against historical privacy issues in the US when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/facebook-settles-with-ftc-5-billion-and-new-privacy-guarantees/">settled with the FTC for $5BN back in July 2019</a> &#8212; although that does still mean there&#8217;s a period of several months (June to September 2019) which could fall outside that settlement.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach/">Yesterday</a>, in its own statement responding to the breach revelations, Facebook&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the EU said the provenance of the newly published dataset wasn&#8217;t entirely clear, writing that it &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">seems to comprise the original 2018 (pre-GDPR) dataset&#8221; &#8212; referring to an earlier breach incident Facebook disclosed in 2018 which related to a vulnerability in its phone lookup functionality that it had said occurred between June 2017 and April 2018 &#8212; but also writing that the newly published dataset also looked to have been &#8220;combined with additional records, which may be from a later period&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>Facebook followed up the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC)&#8217;s statement by confirming that suspicion &#8212; admitting that the data had been extracted from its platform in 2019, up until September of that year.</p>
<p>Another new detail that emerged in Facebook&#8217;s blog post yesterday was the fact users&#8217; data was scraped not via the aforementioned phone lookup vulnerability &#8212; but via another method altogether: A contact importer tool vulnerability.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8SPzr065uI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/">Data is the world&#8217;s most valuable (and vulnerable) resource</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Data is the world&#8217;s most valuable (and vulnerable) resource&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/embed/#?secret=8SPzr065uI" data-secret="8SPzr065uI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This route allowed an unknown number of &#8220;malicious actors&#8221; to use software to imitate Facebook&#8217;s app and upload large sets of phone numbers to see which ones matched Facebook users.</p>
<p>In this way a spammer (for example), could upload a database of potential phone numbers and link them to not only names but other data like birth date, email address, location &#8212; all the better to phish you with.</p>
<p>In its PR response to the breach, Facebook quickly claimed it had fixed this vulnerability in August 2019. But, again, that timing places the incident squarely in the period of GDPR being active.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Europe&#8217;s data protection framework bakes in a data breach notification regime that requires data controllers to notify a relevant supervisory authority if they believe a loss of personal data is likely to constitute a risk to users&#8217; rights and freedoms &#8212; and to do so without undue delay (ideally within 72 hours of becoming aware of it).</p>
<p>Yet Facebook made <em>no disclosure at all of this incident to the DPC</em>. Indeed, the regulator made it clear yesterday that it had to <em>proactively</em> <em>seek information from Facebook</em> in the wake of BI&#8217;s report. That&#8217;s the opposite of how EU lawmakers intended the regulation to function.</p>
<p>Data breaches, meanwhile, are broadly defined under the GDPR. It could mean personal data being lost or stolen and/or accessed by unauthorized third parties. It can also relate to deliberate or accidental action or inaction by a data controller which exposes personal data.</p>
<p>Legal risk attached to the breach likely explains why Facebook has studiously avoided describing this latest data protection failure, in which the personal information of more than half a billion users was posted for free download on an online forum, as a &#8216;breach&#8217;.</p>
<p>And, indeed, why it&#8217;s sought to downplay the significance of the leaked information &#8212; dubbing people&#8217;s personal information &#8220;old data&#8221;. (Even as few people regularly change their mobile numbers, email address, full names and biographical information and so on, and no one (legally) gets a new birth date&#8230; )</p>
<p>Its blog post instead refers to data being scraped; and to scraping being &#8220;a common tactic that often relies on automated software to lift public information from the internet that can end up being distributed in online forums&#8221; &#8212; tacitly implying that the personal information leaked via its contact importer tool was somehow <em>public</em>.</p>
<p>The self-serving suggestion being peddled here by Facebook is that hundreds of millions of users had both published sensitive stuff like their mobile phone numbers on their Facebook profiles <em>and</em> left default settings on their accounts &#8212; thereby making this personal information &#8216;publicly available for scraping/no longer private/uncovered by data protection legislation&#8217;.</p>
<p>This is an argument as obviously absurd as it is viciously hostile to people&#8217;s rights and privacy. It&#8217;s also an argument that EU data protection regulators must quickly and definitively reject or be complicit in allowing Facebook (ab)use its market power to torch the very fundamental rights that regulators&#8217; sole purpose is to defend and uphold.</p>
<p>Even if some Facebook users affected by this breach had their information exposed via the contact importer tool because they had not changed Facebook&#8217;s privacy-hostile defaults that still raises key questions of GPDR compliance &#8212; because the regulation also requires data controllers to adequately secure personal data and apply privacy by design and default.</p>
<p>Facebook allowing hundreds of millions of accounts to have their info freely pillaged by spammers (or whoever) doesn&#8217;t sound like good security or default privacy.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/facebook-really-doesnt-want-you-to-read-these-emails/">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> all over again.</p>
<p>Facebook is trying to get away with continuing to be terrible at privacy and data protection because it&#8217;s been so terrible at it in the past &#8212; and likely feels confident in keeping on with this tactic because it&#8217;s faced relatively little regulatory sanction for an endless parade of data scandals. (A one-time $5BN FTC fine for a company than turns over $85BN+ in annual revenue is just another business expense.)</p>
<p>We asked Facebook why it failed to notify the DPC about this 2019 breach back in 2019, when it realized people&#8217;s information was once again being maliciously extracted from its platform &#8212; or, indeed, why it hasn&#8217;t bothered to tell affected Facebook users themselves &#8212; but the company declined to comment beyond what it said yesterday.</p>
<p>Then it told us it would not be commenting on its communications with regulators.</p>
<p>Under the GDPR, if a breach poses a high risk to users&#8217; rights and freedoms a data controller is required to notify affected individuals &#8212; with the rational being that prompt notification of a threat can help people take steps to protect themselves from the risks of their data being breached, such as fraud and ID theft.</p>
<p>Yesterday Facebook also said it does not have plans to notify users either.</p>
<p>Perhaps the company&#8217;s trademark &#8216;thumbs up&#8217; symbol would be more aptly expressed as a middle finger raised at everyone else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched another batch of Starlink satellites, keeping up its rapid pace of launches for the broadband constellation it&#8217;s deploying in low Earth orbit. This now makes 300 Starlink satellites launched since March 4, with 60 on each of five flights between then and now.</p>
<p>The most recent launch before this one happened on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/spacex-launches-60-more-starlink-satellites-making-240-launched-this-month-alone/">March 24</a>, with prior flights on March 14, March 11 and March 4. That pace is intentionally fast, since SpaceX has said it aims to launch a total of 1,500 Starlink satellites over the course of this calendar year. Before that especially busy month, SpaceX also flew four other Starlink missions, including a shared ride on SpaceX&#8217;s first dedicated rideshare mission that also carried satellites for other customers.</p>

<p>In total, SpaceX has now launched 1,443 satellites for its Starlink constellation. That doesn&#8217;t reflect the total number of satellites on orbit, however, as a handful of those earlier satellites have been deorbited as planned. In total, the eventual planned size of the constellation is expected to include up to 42,000 spacecraft based on current FCC frequency spectrum filings.</p>
<p>SpaceX recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nasa-and-spacex-sign-a-special-info-sharing-agreement-to-help-avoid-starlink-collisions/">signed a new agreement with NASA</a> that outlines how the two organizations will avoid close approach or collision events between their respective spacecraft. NASA has measures it requires all launchers to follow in order to avoid these kinds of incidents, but the scale and frequency of SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink missions necessitated an additional, more extensive agreement.</p>

<p>This launch also included a landing of the Falcon 9 booster used, its seventh so far. The booster touched down as intended on SpaceX&#8217;s floating landing pad in the Atlantic Ocean, and will be refurbished for another potential reuse. SpaceX is also going to be looking to recover its fairing halves at sea, which are the two cargo covering shields that encase the satellites during take-off. The company actually just decommissioned two ships it had used to try to catch these out of mid-air as they fell, slowed by parachutes, but it&#8217;s still looking to retrieve them from the ocean after splashdown for re-use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of goods flowing across the U.S.-Mexican border each year, the freight industry has remained analog — each side of the border offering up its own maze of bureaucracy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nuvocargo.com/">Nuvocargo</a>, a digital logistics platform for cross-border trade, is trying to modernize the process. The company offers an all-in-one service that rolls freight forwarding, customs brokerage, cargo insurance and even trade financing into one UI-friendly software and app. Housing all of these services under one app makes it easier for companies to track their supply chain and gives customs and logistics teams access to more centralized information, according to Nuvocargo CEO Deepak Chhugani.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you just have one single audit trail in case something goes wrong,” Chhugani told TechCrunch, adding that the process<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> helps reduce or eliminate the extra costs that come with a high administrative overhead. It also lets customers take a high-level look at their operations from within a single interface, he said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chhugani likened the experience to something like Uber Eats, which offers customers the ability to easily track food orders from restaurant to home.</p>

<p>“Just imagine, because you are dealing with so many different parties, you lose visibility on what’s going on. If you want a snapshot of &#8212; what did I spend end-to-end? &#8212; you actually have to go through all these email chains or faxes or texts with different providers,” Chhugani explained. “Some of them might be in another country. So [Nuvocargo] just creates more visibility throughout the process, from where the goods literally are to visibility around your finances.”</p>
<p>But Nuvocargo is thinking beyond the actual movement of goods. The company is also starting to offer customs brokerage, comprehensive cross-border cargo insurance and factoring, or short-term account receivable finance. The last of these solves an especially difficult pain point for trucking companies, which sometimes must wait up to net-90 days to be paid.</p>
<p>The approach has caught investors’ eyes: Nearly one year after announcing it had raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/nuvocargo-a-trucking-managed-marketplace-raises-5-3m-in-seed-funding/">$5.3 million seed round</a>, the company has closed on a $12 million Series A funding led by QED Investors and with injections from David Velez, Michael Ronen, Raymond Tonsing, FJ Labs and Clocktower. Investors NFX and ALLVP, which participated in the previous round, also participated.</p>
<p>The “holy grail” of their new offerings, as Chhugani called it, is trade financing. Because Nuvocargo will already have a relationship with companies, including an understanding of credit and fraud risk, its hope is that it can offer financial products at a competitive rate.</p>
<p>This is what attracted QED Investors, a firm that typically focuses on financial technology rather than logistics and trucking.</p>
<p>“After speaking with [Deepak] and seeing the connection points and parallels between what we were looking at in e-commerce and the challenges of actually getting goods across border, the fintech spark went off in my own head,” Lauren Connolley Morton, a partner at QED, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “The opportunities for factoring, for lending, for insuring goods are all very much right up our alley.”</p>
<p>Although Chhugani declined to disclose Nuvocargo’s valuation after this most recent round of funding, it’s clear there is plenty of room to grow into the logistics industry’s huge and seemingly disaggregated value chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blackinnovationalliance.com/">Black Innovation Alliance </a>and <a href="http://www.vilcap.com/">Village Capital</a> today announced Resource, a national initiative aimed at boosting the efforts of entrepreneur support organizations (ESOs) led by, and focused on, founders of color.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The motivation behind the project is straightforward. ESOs “face record demand, declining resources and are chronically underestimated, underappreciated and underfunded,” the organizations say.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resource aims to give local accelerators and incubators support in the form of training and community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Resource’s &#8220;ESO Accelerator” will train startup ecosystem leaders on how to build a more financially sustainable organization, as well as help connect them to potential funders. It also will provide milestone-based financial support tied to organizational development.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resource also plans to build a national community of practice among ESO leaders of color and their funders to share best practices and “develop stronger capital and mentorship pathways&#8221; for Black, Latinx and Indigenous founders across the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Village Capital, says CEO Allie Burns, supports and invest in entrepreneurs “who have been historically sitting in historical blind spots of investors, whether that&#8217;s by the problems they&#8217;re trying to solve, the geography they&#8217;re located in or demographic factors that we have seen lead to capital being concentrated in very few people, places and problems.” Village Capital has worked with more than 100 other ESOs to help grow companies with founders from all backgrounds over the past five years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal with Resource is to help ensure that incubators and accelerators focused on supporting people of color have the resources they need to flourish, she added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We want to make sure that those accelerators and other ESOs have the financial, social and human capital to keep their doors open and grow,” Burns said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Black Innovation Alliance Executive Director Kelly Burton points out that these Black-led organizations are often the first line of support for Black entrepreneurs yet reap few benefits from their success over time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They receive very little support and very little funding,” she said. “It&#8217;s almost like they do all the heavy lifting, they plant seeds and do all the cultivation but they don&#8217;t really get to benefit once that founder and that startup has really taken off. This is an opportunity for us to stabilize these organizations to help them build their own capacities and capabilities so that that organization can be sustainable.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Resource is supported by a national coalition of funders committed to supporting entrepreneurs of color. The initial coalition includes Moody’s, The Sorenson Impact Foundation, Travelers and UBS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In related news, on Tuesday we covered New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/new-jersey-announces-10m-seed-fund-aimed-at-black-and-latinx-founders/">proposal</a> for a $10 million allocation in the state budget to create a seed fund for Black and Latinx startups.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In that piece, we noted that there are a number of organizations out there that are committed to funding diverse founders.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In February, several national and Chicago-based organizations banded together to support early-stage Black and Latinx tech entrepreneurs through a new program dubbed <a href="https://techrise.co/">TechRise</a>. The nonprofit P33 launched the program in partnership with Verizon and 1871, a private business incubator and technology hub, among others, with the goals “of narrowing the wealth gap in Chicago, generating thousands of tech-related jobs and giving $5 million in grant funding to Black and Latino entrepreneurs,” according to the <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/2/25/22301698/techrise-initiative-support-chicago-black-latinx-latino-tech-founders">Chicago Sun Times</a>. (Disclosure: Verizon is TechCrunch’s parent company).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also in Austin, <a href="https://divinc.org/">DivInc</a> is a nonprofit pre-accelerator that holds 12-week programs for underrepresented tech founders. Founded in 2016 by former Dell executive Preston James, the organization aims to “empower people of color and women entrepreneurs and help them build successful high-growth businesses by providing them with access to education, mentorship and vital networks.”</p>
