<p>Here’s why one of your contemporaries, Katia Paramonova, founder and CEO of Centrly, says you should consider attending TC Early Stage 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>“Early Stage 2020 provided a rich, bootcamp experience with premier founders, VCs and startup community experts. If you’re beginning to build a startup, it’s an efficient way to advance your knowledge across key startup topics.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at just some of the topics we have on tap for you at ES 2021.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LA-based game studio <a href="https://www.singularity6.com/">Singularity 6</a> has banked more funding as it scales itself up and readies for the launch of its debut title.</p>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch, they&#8217;ve raised $30 million in a Series B bout of funding led by FunPlus Ventures with additional participation from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), LVP, Transcend, Anthos Capital and Mitch Lasky. The studio has now disclosed some $49 million in funding, a sizable sum, but one that showcases how much investors are looking to rally around gaming platform plays in the wake of Roblox&#8217;s monster IPO.</p>
<p>In 2019, Singularity 6 raised a $16.5 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz. At the time, the studio was mum on details about its upcoming debut title, but we&#8217;ve learned more about it since.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The title, <em>Palia</em>, is a community simulation game that seems to be more focused on Animal Crossing-like community mechanics in an MMO environment, rather than endless battles. Last month, the studio showcased a launch trailer of the title which hinted at a good deal of the gameplay. <em>Palia</em> looks to be a medieval Zelda-like environment where users can move between towns in an open world environment while farming and collecting resources to build structures in a shared world.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lP009fvbt8c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The company has said in marketing materials that the title is &#8220;designed to create community, friendships and a real sense of belonging.&#8221; In a statement, a16z partner Jonathan Lai called the upcoming title, &#8220;warm and dynamic.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are still quite a bit of unanswered questions about the title, which is currently taking sign-ups on its website to be alerted to pre-alpha access. We do know that plenty of VCs are betting millions on the prospect that this multi-player title could be big.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday Apple unleashed a whole bunch of new public betas on the world: iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and watchOS 8. Today the company is back with another big software puzzle piece announced at WWDC in June.</p>
<p>Following three weeks of developer beta, the public beta version of macOS 12.0 Monterey is now live for download (i.e. has begun a rollout that often takes a little time to make its way to everyone).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1iIYHliwu3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/apple-just-released-the-first-ios-15-beta-to-everyone/">Apple just released the first iOS 15 beta to everyone</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple just released the first iOS 15 beta to everyone&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/apple-just-released-the-first-ios-15-beta-to-everyone/embed/#?secret=1iIYHliwu3" data-secret="1iIYHliwu3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Any beta version of an operating system comes with the usual caveats/caution against downloading it on your primary machine, but at very least, this ought to be sufficiently more stable than what first rolled out to developers in June. Listen, I’m not going to tell you how to live your life.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172739" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172739" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2172739" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macos-focus.gif" alt="" width="800" height="834" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>I don’t always open these sorts of writeups with system compatibility, but it probably ought to be singled out for Monterey. After all, this is the first full new OS release since the company made the first Apple silicon Macs available last year. Naturally, it will be available for all of the systems sporting a first-party Apple processor.</p>
<p>Intel Macs are more of a grab bag, though support goes back for several years, in most cases.  A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/macos-monterey-compatibility/">nod to Macrumors</a>, who compiled the following list,</p>
<ul>
<li><em>iMac‌ &#8211; Late 2015 and later</em></li>
<li><em>‌iMac‌ Pro &#8211; 2017 and later</em></li>
<li><em>‌MacBook Air‌ &#8211; Early 2015 and later</em></li>
<li><em>MacBook Pro &#8211; Early 2015 and later</em></li>
<li><em>Mac Pro &#8211; Late 2013 and later</em></li>
<li><em>Mac mini &#8211; Late 2014 and later</em></li>
<li><em>MacBook &#8211; Early 2016 and later</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The dates are shifted up by a year or so from the Big Sur compatibility break down, which makes some sense.</p>
<p>Okay, so what do you get if you bite the bullet and download today? The biggest changes come to Safari, FaceTime, along with the addition of the Universal Control feature that unifies peripherals across devices and Shortcuts, an iOS feature that will replace macOS mainstay, Automater.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172741" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172741" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2172741" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macos-safari.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="309" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172741" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Some initial thoughts &#8212; Let’s start with Safari. The browser gets some key updates with every major macOS refresh, but this is one of the largest in recent memory. There was some concern following the keynote that the updates would only introduce confusion for many users. And certainly it’s true that people hate disruptions to their workflow – this is likely one of a handful of reasons I’ve never seriously concerned switching to Safari as a default every day browser. Change is hard, friends. Of course, change is also a necessary part of evolving. In either case, I haven’t been using Monterey intimately enough to offer something more definitive on the Safari experience.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a pretty radical difference up front:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2172748" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.17.47-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="104" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.17.47-PM.png 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.17.47-PM.png?resize=150,15 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.17.47-PM.png?resize=300,30 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.17.47-PM.png?resize=768,78 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.17.47-PM.png?resize=680,69 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.17.47-PM.png?resize=1536,156 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.17.47-PM.png?resize=50,5 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>

<p>It might not seem like much, but after so many generations of the task bar serving as the driving force, it&#8217;s admittedly a pretty bold change at the center of the browser. Your mileage will vary, of course, but the idea at the heart of it is tying the field to the individual tabs, rather than having it more of a constant presence. There&#8217;s more control of of the tabs, as well, in the form of Tab Groups, which allow you to essentially bookmark a bunch of sites together, so you can group them into things like Home and Work (assuming those ever become separate things again).</p>
<p>If you know anything about how Apple makes software, it shouldn&#8217;t come as any surprise that those groups get synced across devices via your Safari account. This is the kind of feature that could break either way for folks &#8212; it either means getting more organized or just creating a whole bunch of news groups of infinite tabs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172762" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172762" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2172762" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg 2050w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=1536,899 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1199 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-01-at-1.30.57-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172762" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The additions to Facetime are a pretty welcome pandemic no-brainer. The biggest addition is a code a lot of third-parties attempted to crack over the past year, bringing the ability to stream movies and TV shows on FaceTime calls with friends, in order to watch together. Again, it&#8217;s a very pandemic-friendly product that will likely continue to have appeal, since teleconferencing certainly isn&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Hepsiburada.com">Hepsiburada</a> — Turkey&#8217;s giant online shopping platform considered the Amazon of its country — floats on the Nasdaq today, for a valuation likely to exceed $3.9 billion on current projections, especially with shares being marked up to $14 apiece (up from the previously predicted $12 pricing). Bu this isn’t the end of the journey for this break-out Turkish tech and e-commerce company, for long-time founder and chairwoman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanzade_Do%C4%9Fan_Boyner">Hanzade Doğan Boyner</a> &#8211; who started the business in 1998 no less, and still has overall control of the company &#8211; considers this closer to a growth round of funding, enabling her ambitious plans to mine Turkey’s fast-developing market even further, as well as expand into Central and Eastern Europe. Doğan Boyner, a scion of the powerful Doğan family in Turkey, continues to hold three-quarters of the voting power in the company, according to the prospectus filed to the SEC.</p>
<p>Hepsiburada’s IPO comes after it more than doubled its revenue during the pandemic, as Turkey’s largely offline population was forced to switch to online shopping in what might well be characterized as a sort of enforced &#8216;Great Leap Forward&#8217; for the country. </p>
<p>Hepsiburada (which translates as “everything is here”) is also making history as the first-ever Turkish, NASDAQ IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With a massive logistics platform spread across Turkey, the company now offers 2hr deliveries, with around 43 million products available on the platform, available from a more Chinese-like ‘super-app’ which can offer everything from groceries to flights, to payment services, via is ‘Alipay-like’ service called Hepsipay. And in Turkey, many people prefer to buy things on installments, a service Hepsiburada has pre-built into its platform.</p>
<p>Turkish people have also enjoyed its frictionless returns, where goods can be returned for free, involving a super-efficient logistics network.</p>
<p>After growing at about 50% year on year for the last five years, the company says it doubled in size last year, taking advantage of the exponential growth in Turkey’s e-commerce penetration into its 82 million-strong population.</p>
<p>The IPO comes after a mere $100m was invested in the platform over the last 20 years, and a profit-making period until 2018 when Doğan Boyner started investing more in the platform, prior to this moment.</p>
<p>TC: What brought you to this moment in time in terms of the IPO?</p>
<p>Doğan Boyner: &#8220;Almost 20 years ago I started with e-commerce and from day one we built it with new features, new services, and today we manage a fully integrated ecosystem, from last-mile delivery to payment to groceries. Hepsiburada is the super app that makes our customer&#8217;s lives easier. They can get their groceries or their toys for next-day delivery or flight tickets. Why are we listing now? Because the Turkish e-commerce market is at 10% penetration, and we believe that its penetration will double by 2025. It&#8217;s an inflection point. It&#8217;s a large market, and as Hepsiburada we are a pioneering platform reaching maturity towards becoming a public company. With the funds raised through the IPO, we will accelerate our growth and continue to execute our vision.”</p>
<p>TC: &#8220;Are you satisfied with the $3.9 billion valuation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doğan Boyner: &#8220;Today&#8217;s valuation is not very important for me. It’s not where you start, it&#8217;s where you go. I’m not selling any shares, and this is primarily for growth funding. This is just the beginning. You know, the market is still low penetration, and we have an exciting journey ahead of us. I want the stock to perform well for my investors, but what the value today is irrelevant for me.”</p>
<p>TC: &#8220;You&#8217;re going to use some of this funding to add on new products onto the platform like booking flights or money transfers and other kinds of new products, what are some of the other kinds of expansion plans you have?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doğan Boyner: &#8220;One is to continue building our infrastructure, such as frictionless returns, which gives such peace of mind to our consumers. The second is Hepsi Express. It&#8217;s still only at 4% penetration. This will change the consumer’s grocery shopping habit because we have such a strong model where we partner with a lot of national chains, regional chains, Mom-and-Pop shops, so we turn those stores into our ‘dark stores’. Plus we sometimes do our own picking from the stores or sometimes the retailer does the picking. So the customer offering is very strong. You can get something in half an hour, or you can schedule it for next day, whenever you want. You can do the weekly shopping, or just get something for that night. Express is an area that we will scale. Payment is another focus. We are the only platform with a payments license. Soon it will be an open wallet and our Fintech capabilities will increase post IPO.”</p>
<p>TC: Are you following a sort of Alibaba / Alipay strategy?</p>
<p>Doğan Boyner: &#8220;We will leverage our current customers and marketplace, and we will turn them into our wallet customers. Super apps don’t really exist in Europe or the US. So it’s our vision to digitalize commerce. We are in our customer&#8217;s pocket. We want to make life easier for them.”</p>
<p>TC: &#8220;How did you shift operations during the pandemic?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doğan Boyner: &#8220;We almost became a lifeline, not just for consumers but for our merchants as well. So we rose to the occasion to not only scale operationally. We had to onboard 1000s of drivers and employees, very, very fast, but we also had to secure the well-being of our employees. While all of us were isolating we had to ask our employees to work, which, which I think we&#8217;ve done a very, very good job of, in terms of providing PPE, and providing health coverage. It was a chance to live up to our values. Our consumers experimented with us as new consumers, and they&#8217;re happy with the service so they will stay with us and our merchants appreciated us as well, because in a time when their shops were closed, they could generate revenues through us.”</p>
<p>TC: You&#8217;ve been a big advocate of women in your company and also in your country, you&#8217;ve created many programs for women and girls and engaged in a great deal of advocacy. Where do you feel you are on that journey?</p>
<p>Doğan Boyner: &#8220;Half far our workforce is female, 33% of our management is female &#8211;  which should be 50%! Our woman entrepreneur program has been very impactful. We tell women entrepreneurs to come, we will teach you ecommerce, we will onboard your products, we will give you free shipping, we will prioritize your products or listing pages, we will give you real estate on our home page. Some 19,000 women have benefitted from this. Women have sent me their inspiring stories. They start small and hire two people, and then they create their own brands. Having said that, when I look at where we are in terms of gender equality globally, the needle doesn&#8217;t move much. You look at the number of CEOs in the FTSE 500, the number doesn&#8217;t change. So, I will keep doing whatever I can, because every &#8216;small drop&#8217; counts. And hopefully, it will. I also think there should be a new conversation, a global conversation about gender equality in general. The 19,000 women who benefited from our program became economically more empowered. They gained skills and tools and confidence to trade on a platform like Hepsiburada, which is very meaningful.&#8221;</p>
<p>TC: Are you concerned that perhaps your success may attract the attention of government regulation in Turkey, in the future?</p>
<p>Doğan Boyner: &#8220;We are considered a national champion. Turkey has different dynamics. I think it&#8217;s an inspiration that national champions can come out and be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>TC: You&#8217;ve been very hugely successful, you&#8217;re a big advocate for women in your country, do you have any political aspirations?</p>
<p>Doğan Boyner: &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When considering a move to the United States, Indian startup founders first need to make a mental pivot to face the market they want to sell into and ask themselves how much risk they are willing to own.</p>
<p>In the SaaS space, there are (broadly) two types of companies you can build. The first option is to create a better product than what is currently available on the market — like better accounting software or a CRM, or a better marketing automation tool, especially for the mid-market companies. This path is well-worn &#8212; Indian companies Zoho and Freshworks are leading examples.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The first mistake Indian entrepreneurs make when coming to America is to assume that a large market and a customer base open to novel products means your first step should be buying a plane ticket.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The second &#8212; and riskier &#8212; option is to build something in an entirely new category, which is what we&#8217;re doing at Talview, where we&#8217;re building a video AI platform for digitized talent processes for companies making hiring decisions. Creating a new market is a high-risk scenario lined with pitfalls disguised as opportunities, but the rewards are potentially immense.</p>
<p>The first type of company never has to leave India. You can start your company there, hire local talent and begin selling your high-quality remote services to midmarket businesses across the globe. The second option works best if you&#8217;re willing to target more advanced SaaS software markets in the U.S.</p>
<h2>No game plan, just a product</h2>
<p>The U.S. is the largest software market and where customers are more likely to try something new. However, the first mistake Indian entrepreneurs make when coming to America is to assume that a large market and a customer base open to novel products means your first step should be buying a plane ticket.</p>
<p>First: Which city will you choose? When entering a new market, founders are also the salesperson, so you need to be prepared to meet customers or investors and get that early traction before you decide to move your operations to the U.S. full time.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/barracuda-networks/">Barracuda Networks</a> has purchased Skout Cybersecurity, a New York-based channel-only provider of extended detection and response (XDR) services.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, will see the California-based cybersecurity vendor enter the fast-growing XDR market.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As a result of the ever-increasing attack surface as businesses shift to the cloud and embrace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/epos/is-hybrid-working-the-future-of-the-workplace/">hybrid working</a>, 80% of security professionals now say XDR solutions — which automatically collect and correlate data from multiple security layers to improve threat detection — should be a top priority for their organization, and 68% of enterprises plan to implement XDR in 2021 and 2022, according to <a href="https://www.secbi.com/pr/secbi-survey-finds-xdr-is-top-cybersecurity-priority-for-enterprises-in-2021/">recent research</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>By adopting Skout’s XDR platform, along with the company’s security team, Barracuda says it will be able to offer real-time continuous security monitoring to managed service providers, or MSPs, enabling them to address threats more efficiently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Skout, an early-stage cyber-as-a-service startup that had amassed a total of $25 million in funding from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/rse-ventures/">RSE Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clear-sky">ClearSky</a>, also offers AI-powered endpoint protection, email protection services, and Office 365 monitoring through its XDR platform.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The acquisition also continues Barracuda’s strategic M&amp;A momentum, which includes the recent acquisition of zero trust access provider Fyde. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“MSPs must be able to protect their customers’ end users, their devices, and the data they are accessing with these devices against increasingly sophisticated threats. To achieve this level of protection for their customers, and themselves, MSPs are transforming their businesses into &#8220;security-centric&#8221; operations,” said Brian Babineau, SVP and general manager at Barracuda MSP.</p>
<p>“The addition of Skout enables Barracuda’s MSP partners to deploy security solutions across their environments, connecting their data feeds into a unified, 24&#215;7 operation for swift analysis and response.”<b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close later this month, subject to obtaining required regulatory and third-party consents, and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Previously a public company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/security-business-barracuda-networks-acquired-for-1-6-billion/">Barracuda was taken private by private equity firm Thoma Bravo</a> who acquired the company for $1.6 billion in November 2017.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The company, which competes with Palo Alto Networks and Symantec, provides security for cloud-connected networks and applications and counts <a href="https://www.barracuda.com/customers">the likes of Delta Airlines, Hootsuite, and Samsung</a> among its 200,000+ customers. </span></p>

The Stanford graduate <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/25-year-old-earns-6-figures-playing-chess-on-twitch.html">earns six figures</a> playing chess on Twitch, where <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/botezlive">she has 877,000 followers</a>. But when she tried to apply for a business credit card, she was rejected twice. Meanwhile, when the creator behind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsRtomD4twRf5WVHHk-cMw">TierZoo</a>, a YouTube channel with 2.7 million subscribers, tried to rent an apartment, he was rejected because his landlord didn&#8217;t see his business as legitimate.</p>
<p>Eric Wei noticed this disconnect while he was a Product Manager at Instagram, where he helped build Instagram Live. With co-founder Will Kim, a previous investor with seed fund Lucky Capital, Wei launched <a href="https://www.trykarat.com/">Karat Financial</a>, a better banking system for digital creators. Today, Karat Financial announced a $26 million Series A round led by Union Square Ventures with participation from GGV Capital and SignalFire.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Banks need to understand you in order to trust you, and it&#8217;s only when they trust you that they&#8217;re willing to give you credit, process your payments, and hold your money,&#8221; Wei told TechCrunch. &#8220;If Alexandra Botez has 800,000 followers, and let&#8217;s say a tenth of them are paying a monthly subscription fee on Twitch, you can actually back into what these creators&#8217; income streams are, and develop a better underwriting model than what the banks have today.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Karat isn&#8217;t solving a problem exclusive to the 1% of digital creators. Even for someone like a self-employed small business owner or a gig worker, it can be challenging to find a landlord that will rent an apartment without a proof of employment letter and regular paystubs. But the creator economy remains a fast-growing sector &#8212; more than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattklein/2020/09/23/50m-join-the-creator-economy-as-new-platforms-emerge-to-help-anyone-produce-content--money/?sh=7ade4e813165">two million creators</a> make over $100,000 per year, and according to VC firm SignalFire, <a href="https://signalfire.com/blog/creator-economy/">over 46.7 million people</a> have enough of a following to monetize their content part-time.</p>
<p>&#8220;This whole industry exploded,&#8221; said Kim. &#8220;If it&#8217;s a flash in the pan, it&#8217;s a fifteen-year-old flash.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Wei and Kim founded Karat in 2019, then earned a spot in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/venture-capitalists-like-and-subscribe-to-influencers/">Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2020 accelerator. </a>By June 2020, Karat launched its first product, the Karat Black Card, a credit card for creators, and earned </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/karat-black-card/">$4.6 million in seed funding</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from investors like Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Our vetting process is we try to evaluate creators as the businesses they are,&#8221; Wei said. The Karat Black Card doesn&#8217;t charge interest or fees, and only turns a marginal profit off of bank interchange fees. Karat will also advance credit for sponsorship payments at no cost to the creator. So if you&#8217;re an influencer and get paid $1,000 to make a video sponsored by a clothing company, it could take months to get paid. Karat will give you that $1,000 now, so long as you pay them back once the clothing company pays you.</p>
<p>Karat proved its concept with 50% growth from month to month and eight figures in transactions since launch last year. More than 30 creators have invested in Karat, including <a href="https://twitter.com/JaredLeto?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Jared Leto</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/3lau/">3LAU</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nasdaily">Nas Daily</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joshrichards?lang=en">Josh Richards</a> &#8212; that&#8217;s all without any spending on influencer marketing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It turns out that when you do a good job for creators, they share you around with other people,&#8221; Wei said.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Since then, their portfolio of investors has grown to include YouTube co-founder Steven Chen, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, Former TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer, and Former Wealthfront CEO Adam Nash, among others.</span></p>
<p>But Karat&#8217;s ultimate ambition isn&#8217;t to give creators a line of credit. They started out with the credit card to prove their concept, but in the long term, they hope to create a financial infrastructure for creators. That means helping them launch merchandise lines, incorporate their business, get a mortgage, take out business loans, and file their taxes. Wei says that would come after the company&#8217;s Series B, opening a more lucrative income stream than collecting bank interchange fees.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided to roll Karat out with the same tried and true fintech playbook,&#8221; Wei said. &#8220;Start out with something simple before wedging and scaling into those other products. So for us, the card is just a means to an end. Our whole model is, we use the cards to develop our underwriting model and gain trust from creators, and eventually, we can build to be Square for creators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Already, Wei and Kim are getting texts from their internet celebrity clients, asking them to be their de-facto financial advisors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just like, oh my gosh, we love you, but we&#8217;re not building those products yet,&#8221; Wei said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll do that when we hit our Series B, and yes, we&#8217;ll charge you fees, because we&#8217;re going to provide you with better service than what&#8217;s out there now.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the newly announced Series A round, Karat plans to double its staff with new hires and begin looking toward new product development.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinlane/">Kin Lane</a> is chief evangelist at <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>, an API development platform with a user base of over 13 million software developers.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">APIs, or application programming interfaces, make the digital world go round. Working behind the scenes to define the parameters by which software applications communicate with each other, APIs underpin every kind of app — social media, news and weather, financial, maps, video conferencing, you name it. They are critically important to virtually every enterprise organization and industry worldwide.</p>
<p>Given APIs&#8217; ubiquity and importance, it’s understandable that all industry eyes were on the U.S. Supreme Court’s April 5 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/18-956_d18f.pdf">ruling</a> in Google LLC v. Oracle America Inc., an 11-year-old case that addressed two core questions: Whether copyright protection extends to an API, and whether use of an API in the context of creating a new computer program constitutes fair use. Google lawyers had <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-956/95912/20190410092802431_Google%20Cert.%20Reply.pdf">called</a> it &#8220;the copyright case of the decade.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was one of 83 computer scientists — including five <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/">Turing Award</a> winners and four National Medal of Technology honorees — who signed a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-956/128391/20200113145027664_18-956%20Google%20v%20Oracle%20Computer%20Scientists%20Merits%20Amicus%20FOR%20FILING.pdf">Supreme Court amicus brief</a> stating their opposition to the assertion that APIs are copyrightable, while also supporting Google’s right to fair use under the current legal definition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			To be clear: APIs should be free of copyright, no ifs, ands or buts.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We explained that the freedom to reimplement and extend existing APIs has been critical to technological innovation by ensuring competitors could challenge established players and advance the state of the art. &#8220;Excluding APIs from copyright protection has been essential to the development of modern computers and the internet,&#8221; the brief said.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruling was a mixed bag that many observers are still parsing. In a 6-2 decision, justices sided with Google and its argument that the company’s copying of 11,500 lines of code from Oracle’s Java in the Android operating system was fair use. Great! At the same time, though, the court appeared to be operating under the assumption that APIs are copyrightable.</p>
<p>“Given the rapidly changing technological, economic and business-related circumstances, we believe we should not answer more than is necessary to resolve the parties’ dispute,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the majority. “We shall assume, but purely for argument’s sake, that [the code] “falls within the definition of that which can be copyrighted.”</p>
<p>While it may take years to fully understand the ruling’s impact, it’s important to keep dissecting the issue now, as APIs only continue to become more essential as the pipes behind every internet-connected device and application.</p>
<p>The legal saga began when Google used Java APIs in developing Android. Google wrote its own implementation of the Java APIs, but in order to allow developers to write their own programs for Android, Google&#8217;s implementation used the same names, organization and functionality as the Java APIs.</p>
<p>Oracle sued Google in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in August 2010, seven months after it closed its acquisition of Java creator Sun Microsystems, contending that Google had infringed Oracle’s copyright.</p>
<p>In May 2012, Judge William Alsup ruled that APIs are not subject to copyright because that would hamper innovation. Oracle appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which reversed Judge Alsup in May 2014, finding that the Java APIs are copyrightable. However, he also sent the case back to the trial court to determine whether Google has a fair use defense.</p>
<p>A new District Court trial began in May 2016 on the fair use question. A jury found that Google’s implementation of the Java API was fair use. Oracle appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals in March 2018 again reversed the lower court. Google filed a petition with the Supreme Court in January 2019, receiving a hearing date in early 2020. However, lengthening the case’s torturous path through the courts even further, COVID-19 forced oral arguments to be postponed to last October. Finally, on April 5, the Supreme Court settled the matter.</p>
<p>Or did it?</p>
<p>“Supreme Court Leaves as Many Questions as It Answers in Google v. Oracle,” read a <a href="https://www.law.com/2021/05/27/supreme-court-leaves-as-many-questions-as-it-answers-in-google-v-oracle/?slreturn=20210511103116">headline</a> on <a href="http://law.com">law.com</a>. The National Law Review <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/supreme-court-answers-some-copyright-questions-leaves-others-unsettled-google-v">said</a>: “The Supreme Court sidestepped the fundamental IP issue — whether or not Oracle’s software code at the heart of the case is copyrightable.”</p>
<p>On one hand, I’m disappointed that the court’s ruling left even a hint of ambiguity about whether APIs are copyrightable. To be clear: APIs should be free of copyright, no ifs, ands or buts.</p>
<p>APIs provide structure, sequence and organization for digital resources in the same way that a restaurant menu does for food. Imagine if Restaurant A, which serves burgers, fries and shakes, couldn’t use the same words, as well as the ordering and organization of the words, on their menu as Restaurant B. A menu doesn’t represent a novel expression; rather, it is the ingredients, processes and service that define a restaurant. Both burger places benefit from the shared concept of a menu and the shared knowledge among their consumers of what burgers, fries and shakes are. It is the execution of the menu that ultimately will set one restaurant apart from another.</p>
<p>Likewise, APIs are not intellectual property; they are simply operational elements that are common, reusable, remixable, and able to be put into use in as many applications by as many developers as possible.</p>
<p>This pattern plays out over and over across many different sectors of our economy where APIs are being used, reused and remixed to generate new kinds of applications, integrations or entirely new companies and products or services. Immense value is generated by the free, collective, collaborative and open evolution of APIs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I’m pleased by the part of the Supreme Court ruling that widens the definition of fair use. I think that provides the scope needed to take the industry into its API future without too much friction.</p>
<p>I also believe the case will chill future attempts by other companies to engage in litigation over API copyright. In the end, the decade-long Google vs. Oracle case negatively affected Oracle’s image when it comes to the fast-growing API sector, and I suspect other companies will think twice before going to court.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, companies may want to be extra cautious about licensing their APIs using the widest possible license, applying a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">Creative Commons CC0</a> or CC BY to APIs built with tolls and specifications, such as Swagger, OpenAPI and AsyncAPI.</p>
<p>Now that Google vs. Oracle is finally history, I feel that the API sector will remain as vibrant as ever. That’s excellent news for everybody.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re fresh off of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pittsburgh-city-spotlight/">our big Pittsburgh event</a>, and I’ll have more thoughts on that for you next week, once we’ve crawled through all of the interviews, published profiles and all of that fun stuff. t  I admit that I’m also partly putting that off because there’s just a ton of investment news to get through in the meantime. Though I do want to note that the Pittsburgh Robotics Network held its own big event the<a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/robotics_ai_industry_leaders_announce_commitment_to_make_pittsburgh_the_robotics_capital_of_the_world/prweb18041387.htm"> same day as ours</a> &#8212; honestly, there&#8217;s just a ton of activity in the city this week, including visits from some national politicians.</p>
<p>Per the PRN press release,</p>
<blockquote><p>The alliance brings together leaders from top robotics companies, research institutions and universities in the Pittsburgh area, including Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Argo AI, Aurora, the University of Pittsburgh, Kaarta, RE2 Robotics, Neya Systems, Carnegie Robotics, HEBI Robotics, Near Earth Autonomy, BirdBrain Technologies, Omnicell and Advanced Construction Robotics. The Richard King Mellon Foundation commemorated this membership milestone with a grant of $125,000 to support the continued growth of the PRN.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I hinted the other week that there would be a uptick in funding announcements, and we’ve certainly seen that come to fruition. Once upon a time, we used to have this thing called the summer doldrums. Maybe it’s the pandemic, but formerly slow season no longer really applies here. VCs are still super bullish on robotics and keep pumping money in across the category.</p>
<p>Before we get started, however, a bit of a somber note to say goodbye to Pepper – for now, at least. A rep for SoftBank Robotics confirmed with TechCrunch that the company will be hitting pause on the production of affable robotic greeter.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28/"> Reuters was first to report</a> a “retrenchment” in SoftBank’s robotics, including the elimination of 330 roles in France. The company noted in a press release, &#8220;Since 2012 SoftBank Robotics Group, a subsidiary of SoftBank, has invested in Humanoid Robotics and intends to keep Pepper &amp; NAO robots business moving forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a refresher, the investment giant’s 2021 acquisition of French robotics startup Aldebaran Robotics gave rise to both SoftBank Robotics and Pepper. The latter evolved from Nao, a research robot that had pretty wide scale adoption in that world. To this day, you’ll still see the ‘bot at universities and research institutes all over.</p>
<p>Pepper was an attempt to bring some of that underlying technology to a broader commercial audience. The robot was made life-size and designed to hold a tablet and greet people. And, honestly, that was kind of it. Technology in search of a problem, as the saying goes – sophisticated robotics that can greet you at an Applebee’s or offer you some information at the airport.</p>
<p>Precisely why Pepper didn’t work out – and how much issues from the past year played into that – is something better saved for a deeper dive, but I’ve always been skeptical of how useful the robot really was. You’d be hard-pressed to find a compelling argument that this was something that required advanced robotics. Of course, a far more compelling argument can be made that specializing in building research robotics is, at best, a loss leader.</p>

<p>That said, there’s still plenty to get excited about on the robotics investment front. And while SoftBank Robotics may be scaling down, the company’s investment arm appears very bullish on robotics that go beyond just holding up signage. The Vision Fund 2 led a massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/surgical-robotics-company-cmr-raises-600m/">$600 million Series D for CMR Surgical</a>. The U.K.-based surgical robotics firm is now a unicorn three-times over, with a $3 billion valuation for its keyhole surgery tech.</p>
<p>What I find most appealing about the category is its promise of effectively leveling the playing field for highly specialized procedures. That accessibility could prove huge for developing nations and other markets where premium healthcare is more difficult to come by.</p>

<p>Soft Robotics (like SoftBank Robotics, but with less &#8220;bank&#8221;), meanwhile, specifically cited pandemic demand in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/soft-robotics-raises-another-10m-citing-pandemic-related-demand/"> the $10 million extension</a> of its $23 million Series B. Not to go all Upton Sinclair on you, but the meat processing industry sounded utterly hellish through much of the pandemic (as a non-meat eater myself, I’ll save you from some of my more personal reflections on the matter). Soft Robotics has long been among the more compelling startups in the robotic picking space, courtesy of its pneumatic powered grippers that are capable of moving around easily damaged food stuffs.</p>

<p>Never a dull moment. Here&#8217;s the fun of writing a large roundup on Wednesday for Thursday. Sometimes big news breaks in the morning (to all you running robotics startups, if you could hold off on announcing big news on Thursdays, that would be great help to me. Thanks in advance), like Zebra&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/zebra-technologies-is-acquiring-warehouse-robotics-company-fetch/">intention to acquire Fetch for $290 million</a>. I&#8217;ve got some more thoughts on this in piece and will be sharing some later, but meantime, a quote from Fetch CEO Melonee Wise,</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fetch team is excited to join Zebra and accelerate the adoption of flexible automation through AMRs and our cloud-based robotics platform. Together we have the right team with the right technology to provide end-to-end solutions that solve real customer problems. By helping customers dynamically optimize and holistically orchestrate their fulfillment, distribution, and manufacturing operations, together we help enable their ability to stay ahead of growing demand, minimize delivery times and address shrinking labor pools.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>*Picking berries not to be confused with picking&#8230;anything else. We&#8217;re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjJvBarVRss">rooting for you, Biz</a>.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is making it possible to store digital versions of either Covid-19 test results or vaccination cards on users&#8217; Android devices. The company on Wednesday announced it&#8217;s updating its <a href="https://developers.google.com/pay/passes">Passes API</a>, which will give developers at healthcare organizations, government agencies, and other organizations authorized by public health authorities the ability to create digital versions of tests and vaccination cards which can then be saved directly to the user&#8217;s device. The Passes API is typically used to store things like boarding passes, loyalty cards, gift cards, tickets and more to users&#8217; Google Pay wallet. However, the Google Pay app in this case will not be required, Google says.</p>
<p>Instead, users without the Google Pay app will have the option to store the digital version of the Covid Card directly their device, where it&#8217;s accessible from a homescreen shortcut. Because Google is not retaining a copy of the card, anyone who needs to store the Covid Card on multiple devices will need to download it individually on each one from the healthcare provider or other organization&#8217;s app.</p>
<p>The cards themselves show the healthcare provider or organization&#8217;s logo and branding at the top, followed by the person&#8217;s name, date of birth, and other relevant information, like the vaccine manufacturer or date of shot or test. According to a support document, healthcare providers or organizations could alert users to the ability to download their card via email, text, or through a mobile website or app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an example photo, Google showed the Covid-19 Vaccination Card from Healthvana, a company that serves L.A. County, However, it didn&#8217;t provide any other information about which healthcare providers are interested in or planning to adopt the new technology. Reached for comment, Google says there are some other big partners and states in the pipeline, but it doesn&#8217;t have permission to share those names at this time. Over the next few weeks, some of these names will be released, we understand.</p>
<p>The Passes API update doesn&#8217;t mean Android users can immediately create digital versions of their Covid vaccination cards &#8212; something people have been taking pictures of as a means of backup or, unfortunately in some cases, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/keep-your-covid-19-vaccine-card-safe-but-dont-laminate-it-heres-why">laminating</a> it. (That&#8217;s not advised, however, as the card is meant to be used again for recording booster shots.)</p>
<p>Rather, the update is about giving developers the ability to begin building tools to export the data they have in their own systems about people&#8217;s Covid tests and vaccinations to a local digital card on Android devices. To what extent these digital cards will become broadly available to end users will depend on developer adoption.</p>
<p>For the feature to work, the Android device needs to run Android 5 or later and it will need to be <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7165974">Play Protect certified</a>, which is a licensing program that ensures the device is running real Google apps. Users will also need to set a lock screen on their device for additional security.</p>
<p>Google says the update will initially roll out in the U.S., followed by other countries.</p>
<p>The U.S. is behind other markets in making digital version of vaccination cards possible. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/the-eus-covid-19-digital-certificates-are-up-and-running/">Today, the EU&#8217;s Covid certificate</a>, which shows an individual&#8217;s vaccination status, test results or recovery status from Covid-19, went live. The certificate (EUDCC) will be recognized by all EU members, and will aid with cross-border travel. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/01/1020154/israels-green-pass-is-an-early-vision-of-how-we-leave-lockdown/">Israel released a vaccine passport</a> earlier this year that allows vaccinated people to show their &#8220;green pass&#8221; at places that require vaccinations. <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/06/17/national/vaccine-passports-travel-japan/">Japan aims</a> to have vaccination passports ready by the end of July for international travel.</p>
<p>In the U.S., <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/01/1027768/us-vaccine-passport-guide/">only a few states have active vaccine certification apps.</a> Many others have either outright banned vaccine passports &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/companies-navigate-ethical-minefield-to-build-proof-of-vaccination-apps/">has become</a> a politically loaded term &#8212; or are considering doing so.</p>
<p>Given this context, Google&#8217;s digital vaccination card is just that &#8212; a digital copy of a paper card. It&#8217;s not tied to any other government initiatives nor is it a &#8220;vaccine passport.&#8221;</p>

Its software and services track freight shipments from ports to destinations across Latin America. Over time, it has expanded its offerings and now also automates insurance policies for, and provides financing, to its clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this way, we allow our clients to import and export more, which helps them grow their businesses and improves the foreign trade conditions of the region,&#8221; said Nowports CEO and co-founder Alfonso de los Rios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 was a good year for Nowports, which saw its revenue climb by 605% compared to 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our 2021 goal is 400% to 600%,” de los Rios told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company currently has offices in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay. Nowports plans to use its new capital in part to expand its 160-person team to China, according to de los Rios. It also plans to expand its logistics and financial services and to “solidify its most important routes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With platforms, algorithms with AI and integrations, our platform allows companies to take control of their shipments and plan and predict the best timing to move the freight based on the needs of their own company,” he said at the time of the company’s seed raise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal with the series A is to position ourselves as the biggest digital freight forwarder in the region and expand our venture financing solution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tens of millions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of containers are imported and exported from Latin America each year, and nearly half of them are either delayed or lost due to mismanagement. And, an estimated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% of shipping containers suffer delays due to disorganized processes or errors during transport, which ends up costing companies billions per year. It’s a big opportunity. And, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowports pledges to shippers that its digital management software will keep track of each container. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Slow, inefficient, and manual processes in international logistics are disassociated from today&#8217;s technological world&#8221;, said Nowports co-founder and COO Maximiliano Casal. “Customers are looking for solutions that can improve their logistics processes adapted to current challenges of international trade.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two co-founders of Nowports met at a program at Stanford University, with de los Rios hailing from a family with deep ties to the shipping industry. He and Casal linked up and the two began plotting a way to make the deeply inefficient industry more modern and transparent. To familiarize himself with the market for which he’d be developing a technology, Casal worked with a freight forwarder in Kansas City that had been operating for more than 30 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Sidgmore, co-founder and partner of seed round lead investor Broadhaven Ventures, described the team as “visionaries in the freight forwarding industry who see the ability to build the operating system for the shipping industry, much like Carta has done for equity ownership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need to track and digitize the supply chain process was never more apparent than with the recent blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given, which became a meme that represented the impacts of inefficiencies in the supply chain, Sidgmore said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nowports has created industry leading technology to help its customers know when to turn starboard or port side,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Gottschalk, senior advisor of Mouro Capital, said the Nowports platform brings both “transparency and technology” to a global client base.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A regulation underpinning a digital certification system for individuals in the European Union to verify their COVID-19 status via a common credential has gone into application today &#8212; on schedule.</p>
<p>From today, almost all EU Member States are now able to issue and verify digital certificates, per the Commission &#8212; with only a handful of (mostly) EEA countries still pending a step, according to its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en">website</a>.</p>
<p>A number of countries had started issuing certificates earlier. The regulation also allows for a six-week phasing in period.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Commission said more than 200 million certificates have been generated already.</p>
<p>The &#8220;EU Digital COVID Certificate&#8221; &#8212; which has gone through a few names since the idea was publicly floated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/europe-is-working-on-a-common-framework-for-vaccine-passports/">back in January</a> &#8212; is intended to help facilitate cross-border travel within the bloc by providing standardized and universally accepted certification.</p>
<p>EU citizens still have the right to free movement &#8212; even without the certificate &#8212; but having the common credential may help facilitate travel around the bloc, such as by exempting holders from needing to undergo COVID-19-related restrictions like quarantine.</p>
<p>Certificates can be issued to people within EU Member States who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus with a verified vaccine; who have previously had the disease (and therefore have antibodies); or to people who have had a recent negative test.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s been called a &#8220;digital&#8221; certificate, a paper version can also be issued &#8212; which similarly contains a scannable QR code (albeit printed) &#8212; so there&#8217;s no requirement for individuals to have a mobile device to be able to use the certificate to help them travel.</p>
<p>Certificates are also issued free of charge.</p>
<p>The Commission has previously said that no personal data is “exchanged or retained” during the digital certificate verification process. Signature keys for the verification are stored on servers at a national level and only accessed — via a centralized gateway — at the point the certificate is scanned.</p>
<p>The EU rules for the digital certificate stipulate that Member States must refrain from imposing additional travel restrictions on holders &#8212; unless such steps are &#8220;necessary and proportionate&#8221; to safeguard public health.</p>
<p>The regulation is due to expire in a year&#8217;s time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We first covered Traptic back in 2019, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/traptic-uses-3d-vision-and-robotic-arms-to-harvest-ripe-strawberries/">appeared as a Battlefield finalist</a> on stage at Disrupt SF. Today, the South Bay robotics startup is announcing some major progress. For starters, it began commercial deployment of its strawberry-picking mobile robot early this month.</p>
<p>Traptic tells TechCrunch that Blazer-Wilkinson, a top-five U.S. strawberry producer, began to deploy the technology in June, the system working in tandem with human pickers. That follows a pilot in 2020, when many agriculture companies were seeking assistance amid pandemic-related shortages.</p>
<p>Even prior to COVID-19, labor shortages have resulted in tremendous waste. According to Traptic’s figures, roughly 10% of U.S. strawberries rot in the field, unpicked, resulting in up to $300 million in waste, annually. During the pandemic, there was an even larger crunch, as H-2A workers suffered from restricted travel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s acceleration comes thanks to an unannounced $5 million Series A from Collaborative Fund, Homebrew Ventures and K9 Ventures that arrived in late-2019, before COVID-19 was on the world’s radar. &#8220;We used the recent funding to run a successful pilot,&#8221; cofounder and CEO Lewis Anderson tells TechCrunch, &#8220;design and build our commercial-scale machine, and start our first paid deployment.&#8221; The latest round followed an early-stage $3 million raise in 2017 and $400K the year prior. The company has raised $8.4 million in total.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZPmsvnouJ9w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>“As record heat waves force farmworkers indoors and stifle harvests this week, Traptic&#8217;s mission has become more timely than ever,” Collaborative Fund’s Craig Shapiro said in comment offered to TechCrunch. “The launch of their robotic strawberry picker in commercial fields is a big step forward for the $10 billion strawberry market, and a peek into the future of agricultural production more broadly. Collaborative is proud to get behind a technology that can heighten crop security while creating safer jobs across the food supply chain, and we&#8217;re confident that Traptic is the right team to see that vision through.”</p>
<p>Traptic’s system combines 3D cameras and AI vision with robotic arms capable of plucking the fragile fruit without damaging it. The company currently employees around a dozen people largely in robotics and engineering and is advised by Pieter Abbeel of UC Berkeley and Serge Belongie of Cornell.</p>

<p>The deal comes as interesting in warehouse and fulfillment robotics is continuing to heat up, both in the wake of pandemic-fueled labor shortages and as retails are looking for any potential upper-hand in the battle against Amazon’s dominance. It’s been a huge driver for investments in small and large robotics firms alike, including the recently SPACed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/robotics-company-berkshire-grey-to-go-public-via-spac/">Berkshire-Grey.</a></p>
<p>Zebra, for its part, has been extremely aggressive in the category of late. In addition to launching its own retail robotics like the SmartSight inventory system announced early last year, the company has been investing in Fetch’s direct competitors like Locus, for which it led a $40 million Series D last June.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>From the outside, it seems that Zebra is may be looking to consolidate the market around a single unified play. As Locus CEO Rick Faulk told me during another recent round, “We think we can build the most and greatest value by operating independently. There are investors that want to invest in helping everyone that’s not named ‘Amazon’ compete.”</p>
<p>He added, at the time, that the company had no interest in being acquired. I can’t say for certain that Zebra was actively pursuing it, but if today’s news is any indication, it’s clear that the company was looking to jump in with both feet – and Fetch’s diverse, modular offering is a pretty good place to start.</p>

<p>Fetch CEO Melonee Wise adds, “The Fetch team is excited to join Zebra and accelerate the adoption of flexible automation through AMRs and our cloud-based robotics platform. Together we have the right team with the right technology to provide end-to-end solutions that solve real customer problems. By helping customers dynamically optimize and holistically orchestrate their fulfillment, distribution, and manufacturing operations, together we help enable their ability to stay ahead of growing demand, minimize delivery times and address shrinking labor pools.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For edtech startups, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/4-edtech-ceos-peer-into-the-industrys-future/">it’s always been easier to go direct-to-consumer</a> than it is to sell into school districts. The latter has stodgy and strict sales cycles, while the former has a bit more flexibility when it comes to opening up that wallet. The pandemic added validation to this dynamic by supercharging consumer companies like Quizlet and Outschool, bringing them into the unicorn club.</p>
<p>Despite this growth, many startups still think that going B2B, directly into schools, will have the biggest impact on students, especially those who may not be able to afford supplemental services out of school. And while it&#8217;s the long game, Montreal-based <a href="https://paper.co/">Paper,</a> an educational software provider that powers tutoring services in schools, just gave the sector a massive signal that venture-backed returns and school districts can exist in the same sentence.</p>
<p>Paper announced that it has raised $100 million USD in a Series C round led by IVP. Other investors include Framework Venture Partners, Bullpen Capital, Reach Capital, Birchmere Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, BDC Capital and ETW.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, founded in 2014, sells tutoring software to K-12 schools in the United States and Canada. Its software allows students to request live tutor help on-demand, which can then be delivered in four languages across 200 subject areas. In the last year, Paper has grown from 100 tutors to 1000 tutors.</p>
<p>“School districts are not necessarily comfortable working with a company where these educators who have access to all their children are just contractors popping online and disappearing,” said Paper CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/pacutler">Philip Cutler</a>. “[Our tutors] are held to all the same professional standards that a classroom teacher would be.” The company has made its tutors part-time workers, to add a layer of incentive and formality to the working relationship and potentially limit attrition.</p>
<p>Cutler sees Paper as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/">an alternate pathway for teachers looking to make a living</a> outside of traditional school districts. However, scalability demands could inherently clash with what teachers came to the profession to do &#8211; prioritizing speed and number of finished queries instead of consistent, repeatable help.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sClobbnHOH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/">Teachers are leaving schools. Will they come to startups next?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teachers are leaving schools. Will they come to startups next?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/embed/#?secret=sClobbnHOH" data-secret="sClobbnHOH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, the flexibility around how Paper&#8217;s advice looks and arrives is compelling. Paper claims it has 24/7 support, and that a student can request live chat help for five minutes, or for hours depending on the nature of the assignment. Since the company goes in-district, teachers can see where students are struggling most and cater class time to problem areas.</p>
<p>The company embodies a lot of what companies like Quizlet, Course Hero and Brainly have somewhat only recently invested in:<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/the-tech-powered-wave-of-smart-not-slow-tutoring-sessions/"> the rise of smart, not slow, tutoring sessions. </a>They’re all betting that that modern-day extra help may not look like a Zoom, but instead a live chat with a white board feature tacked on.</p>
<p>The company declined to disclose valuation, but instead pointed to other growth metrics to illustrate its positioning in the market. Paper grew its staff from 30 employees to 130 employees. It has also grown 40x in revenue over the past two years, which Cutler said is mostly fueled by strong renewals and the network effect within school districts.</p>
<p>“You don&#8217;t want to be the last district in your community or your area to have it, so we&#8217;ve seen a lot of adoption from that perspective,” he said.</p>
<p>Cutler admitted that there hasn’t been too many breakout B2B edtech businesses for the sector, but he thinks Paper’s latest raise &#8211; its third in the past 18 months &#8211; could be a signal that the entrepreneurial energy of direct-to-consumer might finally be making its way into the hallway.</p>

<p>“I think school districts are more receptive than they&#8217;ve ever been to changing and trying new things, and the last month has really shown us that you can actually take risks and you can try different things in school.”</p>
<p>He added: “It’s been lost in education for a while, and I’m proud of what’s happened over the last year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous driving system developer Ghost Locomotion has raised a $100 million Series D funding round, led by Sutter Hill Ventures. Returning investor Founders Fund also participated in the round, along with Coatue. The money will be used toward R&amp;D as the company continues to develop its highway self-driving and crash prevention technology.</p>
<p>Ghost has been working on a universal collision avoidance technology. The system is premised on the idea that an autonomous driving system doesn’t need to recognize and categorize objects prior to avoiding them – a major paradigm shift. Most systems begin by identifying an object and then use image localization to determine its size, distance and other relevant features.</p>
<p>“We skip that step,” Ghost CEO John Hayes told TechCrunch. “We’re going to recognize anything, any mass that appears in the scene, and then we can get a distance and relative velocity to that. We can start making decisions directly off that data before we’ve classified anything.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ghost instead tracks the movement of clusters of pixels in a scene. Hayes pointed to instances where an object is misclassified, or objects that the system hasn’t trained on, as possible failure modes and a reason why classification does not need to be a prerequisite for collision avoidance. Much of this comes down to the certainty of the system’s decisions. According to Ghost, an autonomous system that starts from image recognition is one loaded with lots of opportunity for uncertainty – and it argues, less safe actions on the road.</p>
<p>One obvious counter-argument is that objects should be classified because they behave differently – a vehicle acts differently than a pedestrian, so classification is what allows a system to predict their behavior. But Hayes said that one shouldn&#8217;t start with classification, but collision avoidance. &#8220;And then if you want to make predictions, you can still do classification,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>One benefit of its system, according to Ghost, is that it requires less computational power – an important consideration for vehicle owners, as higher processing demands can translate into less fuel efficiency. It’s also important for battery electric vehicles that have autonomous driving systems, as each watt of computer power demanded by the AV system can cause a reduction in driving range. Tesla, for example, revealed in 2019 that driving range could be reduced by up to 25% when the driver-assist system was enabled.</p>

<p>Ghost has performed most if its tests off-road, by setting up physical obstacles or by using augmented reality up against a real vehicle. It has not yet started testing its collision avoidance system in an urban environment, where decision complexity skyrockets considerably. Nor has it started testing on public highways – that will begin this year, and scale up next year, with a human safety driver behind the wheel, Hayes said.</p>
<p>The company seems to have slightly altered its market roadmap since it last talked to TechCrunch in 2019. Then, Ghost was developing a consumer kit that would give privately owned passenger vehicles autonomous driving capability on highways. It had estimated that it would debut the kit in 2020, for less than Tesla’s Autopilot package (which went for around $7,000 at the time).</p>
<p>The company hasn’t completely closed the door on this model – Hayes said that “we want to get this in front of customers” – but now it’s also talking about working with automakers directly to get its technology stack into vehicles before they’re even sold.</p>
<p>“We’ll find any path to market we can take,” he added. Under the straight-to-consumer model, the company is starting with a limited number of compatible models, and the cars must be relatively new due to the minimum technological requirements of the system.</p>
<p>Along with the funding news, Ghost also said it had brought on Jacqueline Glassman, former Chief Counsel and Acting Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as General Counsel. She joined the company in April and will likely play a key role as Ghost joins other autonomous driving technology developers in the path to commercialization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is embracing longer videos. The company announced this morning it will roll out the option to create videos of up to 3 minutes in length after first testing the change with a larger number of creators over the past several months. Previously, TikTok videos could be up to 60 seconds in length, after initially expanding from 15-second clips. This 60-second video format had since been copied by newer TikTok competitors, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Snapchat Spotlight</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">YouTube Shorts</a>.</p>
<p>According to TikTok, the company decided to expand its max video length based on feedback it heard from its creator community. For some kinds of content, creators wanted more time and flexibility when filming &#8212; like when they were filming cooking demos, beauty tutorials, educational content, and comedic sketches, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;With longer videos, creators will have the canvas to create new or expanded types of content on TikTok, with the flexibility of a bit more space,&#8221; explained TikTok Product Manager Drew Kirchhoff, in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/longer-videos">announcement</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before the expansion to 3 minutes, many creators had worked around TikTok&#8217;s limitations by encouraging viewers to &#8220;like and follow&#8221; them for part 2 (or 3, or 4&#8230;) of their video series. That may have worked to gain some additional followers, but it became frustrating to viewers who didn&#8217;t want to scroll through the creators&#8217; other videos just to find the rest of the video content they had originally been interested in. It also made it clear how many TikTok creators were having to find a solution to an artificial limitation that didn&#8217;t need to exist.</p>
<p>This change to video length could make TikTok even more of a competitor to YouTube, which has been worried enough about TikTok&#8217;s growth to launch its own TikTok rival directly in its own app, YouTube Shorts. But TikTok understands its platform advantage isn&#8217;t how short the videos are, it&#8217;s the combination of features it offers &#8212; including its extensive library of special effects, AR tools, music catalog, and the dialog created among creators by way of specialized tools like stitches and duets.</p>
<p>Other rivals are also taking notice of the TikTok threat.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Instagram Head <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632?s=21">Adam Mosseri said</a> the Facebook-owned app historically associated with photo-sharing would soon begin experimenting with making short, entertaining videos a more central part of the Instagram experience. He promised Instagram would test out with new ways to better embrace video, including &#8220;fullscreen, immersive, entertaining, mobile-first video.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be honest, there&#8217;s some really serious competition right now. TikTok is huge. YouTube is even bigger,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>TikTok had first begun tests of 3 minutes videos <a href="https://twitter.com/mattnavarra/status/1334125358103277575?lang=en">late last year.</a> The company  says the option to film longer videos will roll out to global users over the weeks ahead. Users will be notified when they receive the update.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most companies don&#8217;t announce their first venture investment after almost 20 years in the business, nor do they announce that round is the equivalent of a good startup&#8217;s entire private fundraising history. But <a href="https://articulate.com/">Articulate</a>, a SaaS training and development platform, is not your typical company and today it announced a whopping $1.5 billion investment on a $3.75 billion valuation.</p>
<p>You can call it Series A if you must label it, but whatever it is, it&#8217;s a hefty investment by any measure. General Atlantic led the round with participation from Blackstone Growth and Iconiq Growth. GA claims it&#8217;s one of the largest A rounds ever, and I&#8217;m willing to bet it&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>CEO Adam Schwartz founded the company with his life savings in 2002 and hasn&#8217;t taken a dime of outside investment since. &#8220;Our software enables organizations to develop, deliver, and analyze online training that is engaging and effective for enterprises and SMBs,&#8221; Schwartz explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that the company started back in 2002 as a plug-in for PowerPoint. Today it is a software service with the goal of helping enable everyone to deliver training, even if they aren&#8217;t a training professional. Articulate actually has two main products, one is a set of tools for companies building training that connects to an enterprise learning management system or LMS. The other is aimed at SMBs or departments in an enterprise.</p>
<p>Its approach seems to be working with the company reporting it has 106,000 customers across 161 countries including every single one of the Fortune 100. Schwartz was loath to share any additional metrics, but did say they hope to use this money to grow 10x over the next several years.</p>

<p>Company president Lucy Suros, who has been with the organization for a decade, says even with this success, they see plenty of opportunity for growth and they felt taking this capital now would really enable them to accelerate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the most dominant player by far in course authoring apps, but when you look at that whole ecosystem and you think about where companies are in transforming from instructor-led training to online training, they&#8217;re still really in the early innings so there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Anton Levy, co-president and managing director at General Atlantic, who is leading the investment for the firm, says that this is a &#8220;big, bold, incredible business&#8221; and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re making an investment of this size and scope. &#8220;The reason we&#8217;re stepping up in such a large way, and what&#8217;s such a large check for us, is because of the business they&#8217;ve built, the team they&#8217;ve built, and frankly the market opportunity that they&#8217;re playing in and their ambition,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Today the company has 300 employees and they have been working as a remote company long before COVID. With the new capital, that number could triple over the next several years. Suros says that when she started at the company, there were 50 employees, mostly male engineers and she went to work to make it a more diverse work environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve put emphasis and a lot of just structural things in place to ensure that we are bringing more [diverse] people to the table, and then supporting folks once they&#8217;re here,&#8221; she said. With the new capital, the company announced a lot of new benefits and she said those were developed with the idea of helping break down barriers for under-represented groups in their ranks including covering gender transition-related costs.</p>
<p>She says that one of the benefits of becoming more visible as a company is being able to talk about and their <a href="https://articulatehco.com/#/lessons/4QO-wAZFGaknlor-QI8Heibaff8OM7yF">human-centered organization framework</a>, the set of principles the company put in place to define its values. &#8220;[We think about] how that can impact the employees and drive human flourishing for its own sake, and that also happens to lead to better business outcomes. But we&#8217;re really also interested in it from [the standpoint that] we want to be good and do good in the world and promote human flourishing at work,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company seems to have been doing just fine up until now, but with this kind of capital, it aims to take the business to another level, while trying to be good corporate citizens as they do that.</p>
