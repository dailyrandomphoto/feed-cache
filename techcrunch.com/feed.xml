										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">They say for every door that opens another closes and the executive shuffle at VMware is certainly proving that old chestnut true. Four months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/">Pat Gelsinger stepped down as CEO</a> to return to run Intel, the virtual machine pioneer announced yesterday that long-time exec <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/ahead-of-dells-spin-out-vmware-appoints-longtime-exec-raghu-raghuram-as-its-new-ceo/">Raghu Raghuram was taking over</a> that role.</p>
<p>That set in motion another change when COO Sanjay Poonen, whom some had speculated might get the CEO job, announced yesterday afternoon on Twitter that<a href="https://twitter.com/spoonen/status/1392467802724868102?s=20"> he was leaving the company</a> after 7 years.</p>
<p>Coincidence? We think not.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says that he was surprised that Poonen didn&#8217;t get the job, but perhaps the VMware board valued Raghuram&#8217;s product focus more highly. &#8220;At 50, he [would have been] a long term solution, and he did a great job on the End User Computing (EUC) side of the product before becoming COO. I guess that it is still not VMware&#8217;s core business,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Regardless, Mueller still liked the choice of Raghuram as CEO, saying that he brought stability and reliability to the position, but he sees him likely as a solid interim solution for several years as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">spins out from Dell</a> and becomes an fully independent organization again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously the board wanted to have someone who knows product, and has been there a long time, and is associated with the VMware core success &#8212; so that creates relatability [and stability].&#8221; He added, &#8220;At 57 he is the transitional candidate, and a good choice, a veteran who is happy to run this 2-3 or maybe 5 years and won&#8217;t go anywhere [in the interim]. And the board has time to find a long-term solution,&#8221; Mueller told me.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ahead of Dell&#8217;s spin out, VMware appoints longtime exec Raghu Raghuram as its new CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/ahead-of-dells-spin-out-vmware-appoints-longtime-exec-raghu-raghuram-as-its-new-ceo/embed/#?secret=pbfoUEiHq6" data-secret="pbfoUEiHq6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mark Lockwood, lead analyst on VMware at Gartner sees Raghuram as the right man for the job with no reservations, one who will continue to implement the current strategy while putting his own stamp on the position.</p>
<p>&#8220;That the VMware board chose someone in Raghu Raghuram who has been <em>the</em> technical strategy executive inside the company for years speaks volumes about the board’s comfort level with the existing strategy trajectory of the company. Mr. Raghuram will most certainly steer the company slightly differently than Mr. Gelsinger did, but at least from the outside, the CEO appointment appears to be a stamp of approval on the company’s broad portfolio,&#8221; Lockwood said.</p>
<p>As for Poonen, he says that the writing was on the wall when he didn&#8217;t get the promotion. &#8220;Although Sanjay Poonen has indeed been a valuable executive for VMware, it was always unlikely that he would remain if not chosen for the CEO role,&#8221; Lockwood said.</p>
<p>Stephen Elliot, an analyst at IDC, was also bullish on the Raghuram appointment, saying he brings a broad understanding of the company, and that&#8217;s important to VMware right now. &#8220;He understands VMware customers, the technologies, M&amp;A, and the importance of execution and its impact on profitable growth. He has been central to almost every successful strategy the company has created, and been a leader for product strategy and execution. He has a very good balance of making tactical and strategic moves to anticipate the value VMware can deliver for customers in a 1-3 year horizon,&#8221; Elliot said.</p>
<p>Elliot thinks Poonen will be just fine and will find a landing spot pretty quickly. &#8220;He is another very talented executive; he will become a CEO elsewhere, and another company will be very lucky,&#8221; he said. He says that it will take time to see if there is any impact from that, but he believes that VMware shouldn&#8217;t have trouble attracting other executive talent to fill in any gaps.</p>
<p>For every every executive move, there are choices for replacements, and subsequent fall-out from those choices. We saw a full-fledged example of that yesterday on display at VMware. If these industry experts are right, the company chose stability and reliability and a deep understanding of product. That would seem to be solid enough reasoning on the part of the board, even though Poonen leaving seems to be collateral damage from the decision, and a big loss for the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Cloud Run</a>, Google Cloud&#8217;s serverless platform for containerized applications, is getting committed use discounts. Users who commit to spending a given amount on using Cloud Run for a year will get a 17% discount on the money they commit. The company offers a similar pre-commitment discount scheme for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/signing-up-committed-use-discounts">VM-based Compute Engine instances</a>, as well as automatic &#8216;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/sustained-use-discounts">sustained use</a>&#8216; discounts for machines that run for more than 25% of a month.</p>
<p>In addition, Google Cloud is also introducing a number of new security features for Cloud Run, including the ability to mount secrets from the Google Cloud Secret Manager and binary authorization to help define and enforce policies about how containers are deployed on the service. Cloud Run users can now also now use and manage their own encryption keys (by default, Cloud Run uses Google-managed keys) and a new Recommendation Hub inside of Cloud Run will now offer users recommendations for how to better protect their Cloud Run services.</p>
<p>Aparna Sinha, who recently became the director of product management for Google Cloud&#8217;s serverless platform, noted that these updates are part of Google Cloud&#8217;s push to build what she calls the &#8220;next generation of serverless.&#8217;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really excited to introduce our new vision for serverless, which I think is going to help redefine this space,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;In the past, serverless has meant a certain narrower type of compute, which is focused on functions or a very specific kind of applications, web services, etc. &#8212; and what we are talking about with redefining serverless is focusing on the power of serverless, which is the developer experience and the ease of use, but broadening it into a much more versatile platform, where many different types of applications can be run, and building in the Google way of doing DevOps and security and a lot of integrations so that you have access to everything that&#8217;s the best of cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>She noted that Cloud Run saw &#8220;tremendous adoption&#8221; during the pandemic, something she attributes to the fact that businesses were looking to speed up time-to-value from their applications. IKEA, for example, which <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90547486/ikeas-e-commerce-was-already-pretty-bad-during-covid-19-it-absolutely-fell-apart">famously</a> had a hard time moving from in-store to online sales, bet on Google Cloud&#8217;s serverless platform to bring down the refresh time of its online store and inventory management system from three hours to less than three minutes after switching to this model.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s kind of the power of serverless, I think, especially looking forward, the ability to build real-time applications that have data about the context, about the inventory, about the customer and can therefore be much more reactive and responsive,&#8221; Sinha said. &#8220;This is an expectation that customers will have going forward and serverless is an excellent way to deliver that as well as be responsive to demand patterns, especially when they&#8217;re changing so much in today&#8217;s uncertain environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the container model gives businesses a lot of flexibility in what they want to run in these containers &#8212; and how they want to develop these applications since Cloud Run is language-agnostic &#8212; Google is now seeing a lot of other enterprises move to this platform as well, both for deploying completely new applications but also to modernize some of their existing services.</p>
<p>For the companies that have predictable usage patterns, the committed use discounts should be an attractive option and it&#8217;s likely the more sophisticated organizations that are asking for the kinds of new security features that Google Cloud is introducing today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next generation of serverless combines the best of serverless with containers to run a broad spectrum of apps, with no language, networking or regional restrictions,&#8221; Sinha writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;The next generation of serverless will help developers build the modern applications of tomorrow—applications that adapt easily to change, scale as needed, respond to the needs of their customers faster and more efficiently, all while giving developers the best developer experience.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year and a half’s worth of global pandemic has had a profound impact on virtually every sector of the workforce. When it comes to future automation food prep isn’t quite at the top of the list (that distinction likely goes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/robotics-roundup-11/">warehouse fulfillment</a>, for the time being), but it’s certainly up there. And it’s easy to see why the events of 2020 and beyond have left many kitchens looking for alternative sources of labor.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Chef Robotics today announced that it has raised a combined $7.7 million pre-seed and seed round, with the goal of helping automate certain aspects of food preparation. The list of investors is pretty long on this one (with seed and pre-seed rolled up into one), including Kleiner Perkins, Promus Ventures, Construct, Bloomberg Beta, BOLD Capital Partners, Red and Blue Ventures, Gaingels, Schox VC, Stewart Alsop and Tau Ventures, among others.</p>

<p>The product team includes ex-employees of Cruise, Google, Verb Surgical, Zoox, and Strateos. Chef’s team isn’t quite ready to show off its robot just yet (hence generic kitchen stock photo #8952 up top) – not entirely unusual for a robotics company still in the early stages. What it <em>has</em> outlined, thus far, is a robotics and vision system destined to increase production volume and enhance consistency, while removing some food waste from the process. Fast casual restaurants appear to be a key focus for this sort of tech.</p>
<p>The company describes it thusly,</p>
<blockquote><p>Chef is designed to mimic the flexibility of humans, allowing customers to handle thousands of different kinds of food using minimal hardware changes. Chef does this using artificial intelligence that can learn how to handle more and more ingredients over time and that also improves. This allows customers to do things like change their menu often. Additionally, Chef’s modular architecture allows customers to quickly scale up just as they would by hiring more staff (but unlike humans, Chef always shows up on time and doesn’t need breaks).</p></blockquote>
<p>More details on the underlying tech soon, no doubt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://legionfarm.com/">Legionfarm</a>, the gaming platform that lets gamers play with pro players in their favorite games, has today announced the close of a $6 million Series A round. Investors in the round include SVB, Y Combinator, Scrum VC, Kevin Lin, Altair Capital, Ankur Nagpal and more.</p>
<p>Legionfarm launched out of Y Combinator at the beginning of last year with a mission to give pro players a way to generate income and amateur players the chance to get better by playing with a pro coach. It started out with an a la carte business model but has since added a subscription product.</p>
<p>It either costs $12/hour to play on an individual session basis (one hour of play) or you can pay $25 or $50/month. That gives gamers access to discounted prices for pros and unlimited sessions with pros who are brand new to the platform, which Legionfarm calls &#8216;rookies&#8217;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded by Alex Belyankin, who is a former pro gamer and was once in the top .01 percent of World of Warcraft players. There are many, many pro caliber players out in the world who can&#8217;t necessarily make a living off of gaming. They either have to be signed by an org (super limited supply) or play in as many tournaments as possible (unreliable) or stream on Twitch.</p>
<p>Legionfarm gives these pros the opportunity to earn a living playing the games they love.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="H20oOTqXNz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/yc-backed-legionfarm-lets-competitive-gamers-pay-to-play-with-pro-coaches/">YC-backed Legionfarm lets competitive gamers pay to play with pro coaches</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YC-backed Legionfarm lets competitive gamers pay to play with pro coaches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/yc-backed-legionfarm-lets-competitive-gamers-pay-to-play-with-pro-coaches/embed/#?secret=H20oOTqXNz" data-secret="H20oOTqXNz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, gamers are always looking to get better but don&#8217;t often have the environments in a game to do so, particularly in Battle Royale games. Legionfarm, which supports a couple of the biggest BRs (Call of Duty: Warzone and Apex Legends), allows these players to team up with pros and learn from them.</p>
<p>The startup is also running a hardware support program, which lets pros on the platform effectively rent gear by paying for it over time in installments that come directly out of their earnings each month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently,  we&#8217;ve learned that one pro player can acquire seven or more new customers to the platform if we work with the pro properly,&#8221; said Belyankin. &#8220;That&#8217;s the biggest growth point for us and the biggest challenge. We don&#8217;t need to demand in the performance channels, but through existing supply. If we manage to build some sustainable processes here, I think we&#8217;re going to skyrocket because we see some huge potential here.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An activist short seller has written a letter to the chief executive of insurance giant Lemonade with details of an &#8220;accidentally discovered&#8221; security flaw that exposes customers&#8217; account data.</p>
<p>Carson Block, founder of investment research firm Muddy Waters Research, sent the letter to Lemonade co-founder and chief executive Daniel Schreiber on Thursday, describing the bug that allowed anyone to inadvertently access personally identifiable data from customers’ accounts as “unforgivably negligent.”</p>
<p>Block&#8217;s <a href="https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/lmnd/open-letter/">letter</a> said: &#8220;By clicking on search results from public search engines, we shockingly found ourselves logged in to and able to edit Lemonade customers&#8217; accounts without having to provide any user credentials whatsoever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lemonade launched in 2015 and offers renters&#8217;, homeowners&#8217; and pet insurance policies across the U.S. and Europe. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/08/softbank-backed-lemonade-files-to-go-public/">went public last year</a> and saw its shares rocket by more than 130% on the day of its initial public offering. Lemonade <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/lemonade-stock-is-falling-after-earnings-februarys-freeze-in-texas-didnt-help-51620827012">this week</a> reported a $49 million quarterly loss, deeper than what Wall Street was expecting.</p>
<p>The bug was co-discovered by Muddy Waters Research and Wolfpack Research, Block said. In <a href="https://twitter.com/Reed_Wolfpack/status/1392829803246587908">a tweet</a>, Wolfpack lead analyst Reed Sherman said one of Muddy Waters&#8217; security experts &#8220;was able to send me a PDF of my renter&#8217;s insurance policy less than 15 minutes after this was first discovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Block told TechCrunch that his firm is shorting the company&#8217;s stock, per his letter, &#8220;because it is clear Lemonade does not give a fuck about securing its customers&#8217; sensitive personal information.&#8221; Block said in his letter that Lemonade should &#8220;shut down its website, APIs, and mobile application&#8221; until the issue is fixed, which he says may date back to July 2020.</p>
<p>Block published his letter to Lemonade with redactions as to not give away specific details of the bug. In a call, Block provided more details about the bug to TechCrunch in order to verify the vulnerability. One indexed search result let us log into a person&#8217;s Lemonade account and view their name, address, and quote details without ever asking for the user&#8217;s password.</p>
<p>A short time later, some of the indexed results stopped working. TechCrunch asked Lemonade for comment but did not hear back prior to publication. We&#8217;ll update when we do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based startup <a href="https://www.sylvera.com">Sylvera</a> is using satellite, radar and lidar data-fuelled machine learning to bolster transparency around carbon offsetting projects in a bid to boost accountability and credibility &#8212; applying independent ratings to carbon offsetting projects.</p>
<p>The ratings are based on proprietary data sets it&#8217;s developed in conjunction with scientists from research organisations including UCLA, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and University College London.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just grabbed $5.8M in seed funding led by VC firm Index Ventures. All its existing institutional investors also participated &#8212; namely: Seedcamp, Speedinvest and Revent. It also has backing from leading angels, including the existing and former CEOs of NYSE, Thomson Reuters, Citibank and IHS Markit. (It confirms it has committed not to receive any investment from traditional carbon-intensive companies when as ask.) And it&#8217;s just snagged a $2M research contract from Innovate UK.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem it&#8217;s targeting is that the carbon offsetting market suffers from a lack of transparency.</p>
<p>This fuels concerns that many offsetting projects aren&#8217;t living up to their claims of a net reduction in carbon emissions &#8212; and that &#8216;creative&#8217; carbon accountancy is rather being used to generate a lot of hot air: In the form of positive sounding PR which sums to meaningless greenwashing and more pollution as polluters get to keep on pumping out climate changing emissions.</p>
<p>Nonetheless the carbon offset markets are poised for huge growth &#8212; of at least 15x by 2030 &#8212; as large corporates accelerate their net zero commitments. And Sylvera&#8217;s bet is that that will drive demand for reliable, independent data &#8212; to stand up the claimed impact.</p>
<p>How exactly is Sylvera benchmarking carbon offsets? Co-founder Sam Gill says its technology platform draws on multiple layers of satellite data to capture project performance data at scale and at a high frequency.</p>
<p>It applies machine learning to analyze and visualize the data, while also conducting what it bills as &#8220;deep analytical work to assess the underlying project quality&#8221;. Via that process it creates a standardised rating for a project, so that market participants are able to transact according to their preferences.</p>
<p>It makes its ratings and analysis data available to its customers via a web application and an API (for which it charges a subscription).</p>
<p>&#8220;We assess two critical areas of a project &#8212; its carbon performance, and its &#8216;quality&#8217;,&#8221; Gill tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We score a project against these criteria, and give them ratings &#8212; much like a Moody’s rating on a bond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carbon performance is assessed by gathering &#8220;multi-layered data&#8221; from multiple sources to understand what is going on on the ground of these projects &#8212; such as via multiple satellite sources such as multispectral image, Radar, and Lidar data.</p>
<p>&#8220;We collate this data over time, ingest it into our proprietary machine learning algorithms, and analyse how the project has performed against its stated aims,&#8221; Gill explains.</p>
<p>Quality is assessed by considering the technical aspects of the project. This includes what Gill calls &#8220;additionality&#8221;; aka &#8220;does the project have a strong claim to delivering a better outcome than would have occurred but for the existence of the offset revenue?&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is a known problem with some carbon offsets claimed against forests where the landowner had no intention of logging, for example. So if there wasn&#8217;t going to be any deforestation the carbon credit is essentially bogus.</p>
<p>He also says it looks at factors like permanence (&#8220;how long will the project’s impacts last?&#8221;); co-benefits (&#8220;how well has the project incorporated the UN’s Sustainability Development Goals?); and risks (&#8220;how well is the project mitigating risks, in particular those from humans and those from natural causes?&#8221;).</p>
<p>Clearly it&#8217;s not an exact science &#8212; and Gill acknowledges risks, for example, are often interlinked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is critical to assess these performance and quality in tandem,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;It’s not enough to simply say a project is achieving the carbon goals set out in its plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the additionality of a project is low (e.g. it was actually unlikely the project would have been deforested without the project) then the achievement of the carbon goals set out in the project does not generate the anticipated carbon goals, and the underlying offsets are therefore weaker than appreciated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed funding in a statement, Carlos Gonzalez-Cadenas, partner at Index Ventures, said: “This is a phenomenally strong team with the vision to build the first carbon offset rating benchmark, providing comprehensive insights around the quality of offsets, enabling purchase decisions as well as post-purchase monitoring and reporting. Sylvera is  putting in place the building blocks that will be required to address climate change.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic finish line in sight &#8212; at least for some &#8212; now is a good time to start assessing which segments have been most impacted by the events of the past year and a half. In terms of robotics, investments have been all over the place &#8212; and for good reasons. COVID-19 seems destined to have a profound and lasting impact on work, and more than ever, robots and automation are going to play a part in that.</p>
<p>Food has been a big target. Manufacturing and health, as well &#8212; all for pretty clear reasons. When we come out of this, however, we may end up seeing that the most immediate and profound impact was on warehouse and fulfillment. Not that it needed much help, but online retail had a huge moment &#8212; led, naturally, by Amazon.</p>
<p>As the company butted heads with workers and union organizers at one fulfillment center in Alabama, the company has been readying additional fulfillment centers. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gov-edwards-announces-new-amazon-robotics-facility-in-shreveport-301286880.html">Shreveport, Louisiana is the latest</a>, with Governor John Bel Edwards referring to the new warehouse as a “robotics fulfillment center.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As with all of these, that means a combination of humans and robots. There are, of course, questions with regard to what the balance will be, going forward. And, of course, it’s no surprise that pro-union Amazon workers frequently cited being treated like a robot among their biggest workplace concerns.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="h9lIRb7Ryx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/robotics-startup-lets-machines-get-closer-as-humans-keep-their-distance/">Robotics startup lets machines get closer as humans keep their distance</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Attempting to stay afloat in the world of Amazon is a big part of why so many warehouses are particularly interested in robotics at the moment. After all, the tech has not only given the retailer a competitive advantage, it’s helped keep them running amid a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Berkshire Grey has been one of the bigger players in the category, thanks in no small part to some massive raises. To date, the Boston-area company has raised $263 million, before announcing a SPAC last year. <a href="https://www.berkshiregrey.com/resources/press-release/berkshire-grey-accelerates-company-momentum-in-2021/">Today, it announced</a> that it’s using some of that money to further expand into markets including Canada and Japan.</p>

<p>“2020 was a pivotal time for eCommerce companies, retailers, grocers and package handling logistics providers – and it continues into this year. The need to automate to meet consumer needs was already pronounced and the pandemic accelerated the changes and increased the need,” founder and CEO Tom Wagner said in a release. “Many of these changes in consumer behaviors are here to stay and that means, businesses need to adapt and improve operations with robotic automation to fulfill those needs. We’re honored to work with companies who have enlisted our AI-enabled robotic solutions to help meet business goals and consumer expectations.”</p>
<p>The already-hot China market continues to gain momentum, as well. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/youibot-funding/">Youibot this week</a> announced a $15 million raise, led by Softbank Ventures. The Shenzhen company is a HAX grad that produces manufacturing robots.</p>

<blockquote><p>Founded by a group of PhDs from China’s prestigious Xi’an Jiaotong University, Youibot develops solutions for factory automation and logistics management, as well as inspection and maintenance for various industries. For example, its robots can navigate around a yard of buses, inspect every tire of the vehicles and provide a detailed report for maintenance, a feature that helped it rack up Michelin’s contract.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Repairability has been a big sticking point for consumer electronics over the past several years. As devices have gotten thinner &#8212; and companies have pushed to maintain control over proprietary systems &#8212; many devices have become near impossible for an every-day person to repair.</p>
<p>It’s an issue for a number of reasons &#8212; not the least of which is an inability to upgrade a system instead of scrapping it altogether. In a world where human impact on the environment is increasingly top of mind, forced obsolescence is an understandably important issue for many.</p>
<p>Framework is one of an increasing number of companies working to address these issues. It’s a list that also includes products like Fairphone on the mobile side. It’s a niche versus the overall market, to be sure, but it’s one that could well be growing. Announced in January, the Framework Laptop <a href="https://frame.work/">is up for preorder today</a>. The 13.5-inch notebook starts at $999 and will start shipping at the end of July.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hMV1Jq8Vt4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The SF-based company had initially targeted spring shipping, but ongoing chip supply problems have delayed the product. The system actually doesn’t look half-bad for a product and company that are clearly repair/upgrade-first.</p>
<p>There are three basic configurations &#8212; Base, Performance and Professional, ranging from $999 to $1,999, upgrading from an Intel Core i5, 8GB of Ram and 256GB of storage to a Core i7 and 32GB/1TB. Windows also gets upgraded from Home to Pro at the top level. At $749, the company offers a barebones shell, where users can plug in their own internals.</p>

<p>Other upgrades include:</p>
<blockquote><p>On top of that, the Framework Laptop is deeply customizable in unique ways. Our Expansion Card system lets you choose the ports you want and which side you want them on, selecting from four at a time of USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, MicroSD, ultra-fast 250GB and 1TB storage, and more. Magnetic-attach bezels are color-customizable to match your style, and the keyboard language can be swapped too.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk defense startup <a href="https://www.spec-trust.com/">SpecTrust</a> is emerging from stealth today with a $4.3 million seed raise and a public launch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber Mentor Fund led the round, which also included participation from Rally Ventures, SignalFire, Dreamit Ventures and Legion Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpecTrust aims to “fix the economics of fighting fraud” with a no-code platform that it says cuts 90% of a business’ risk infrastructure spend that responds to threats in “minutes instead of months.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">January of 2020, I got a bug in my ear to, instead of an API, build a cloud-based service that handles all this complex orchestration and unifies all this data,” said CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nate Kharrl, who co-founded the company with Bryce Verdier and </span>Patrick Chen<span style="font-weight: 400;">. “And, it worked. And it worked fast enough that you can’t even tell it’s there doing its work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, he says, SpecTrust even in its early days was able to pull identity behavior information in seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, it’s more like five and seven milliseconds,” he said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, engineers don’t have to lift anything or adjust data models.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the San Jose, California-based startup’s offering is deployed on the internet, between a website or app and its users, an organization gets fraud protection without draining the resources of its engineers, the company says. Founded by a team that ran risk management divisions at eBay and ThreatMetrix, SpecTrust is banking on the fact that companies &#8212; especially financial institutions &#8212; will be drawn to the flexibility afforded by a no-code offering.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1iqWWNUCCM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/">Don&#8217;t hate on low-code and no-code</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Don&#8217;t hate on low-code and no-code&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/embed/#?secret=1iqWWNUCCM" data-secret="1iqWWNUCCM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the industry is split up between compliance and onboarding, authenticating risk and payments, and user trust and safety, Kharrl said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We put all the tools together to address all things combined, to make sure the person an institution is talking to is who they say they are, and not acting with malicious intent,” he told TechCrunch. “We sit in between them and their traffic to make sure the risk and fraud teams have what they need to spot bad guys.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151466" style="width: 1337px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151466" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2151466 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg" alt="" width="1327" height="716" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg 1327w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SpecTrust.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1327px) 100vw, 1327px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151466" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: SpecTrust</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online businesses spend billions on risk defense yet still lose a lot of money to fraudsters, scammers and identity thieves, Kharrl said. And, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a global shift in the digital economy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as more people came to rely on the internet to meet day-to-day needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With these new trends in commerce and banking came more opportunities for fraudsters, scammers and identity thieves to target people and businesses,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he added. For example, an alarming number of cybercriminals employed no-code attack tools and click-to-deploy infrastructure to launch sophisticated attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech and crypto companies are feeling the biggest impacts, as legacy software designed for big banks, for example, can be slow and expensive, said Kharrl. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We built SpecTrust to instantly put complete assessment, automation and enforcement capabilities in the hands of teams charged with fighting modern cybercrime threats,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using its platform, the company says an organization’s risk team can review and investigate everything a customer does “from its first page view to its last click with unified behavior, identity, history and risk data.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even non-technical staffers can do things like identify attack behavior,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> verify customer identity information, validate payment details and work to mitigate threats before they become losses, according to Kharrl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon Lim of SignalFire says that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SpecTrust has built an end-to-end risk protection platform that enables customers of all sizes and risk profiles “to access the latest innovative risk protection solutions, quickly respond to the evolving threat landscape and share the best practices and learnings across the entire customer base.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, it was drawn to the startup’s no-code platform and ability to provide visibility over every user interaction versus treating each interaction as an independent event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This not only delivers stronger protection to customers but also a smoother experience to the end user,” Lim said.</span></p>
<p>The fraud prevention space is hot these days. Sift, which also aims to predict and prevent fraud, in April <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/fraud-prevention-platform-sift-raises-50m-at-over-1b-valuation-eyes-acquisitions/">raised $50 million in a funding round</a> that valued the company at over $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’re new to Discord, you might be thrown off by the lack of an endless feed peppered with ads. On Discord, all of the action happens in interest-specific servers, and the company wants to make it easier for anyone to stumble across and plunge into those communities.</p>
<p>The company launched<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/"> Stage Channels</a>, its own Clubhouse-like voice event rooms, in late March. With those building blocks in place, in June Discord will start surfacing events (think open mic nights, book clubs, etc.) through a new portal called Stage Discovery, adding a way for anybody to connect with the cool communities in the process.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2151701 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg" alt="discord-stage-discovery" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord-stage-discovery.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Discord Product Manager Rick Ling says Stage Channels are a hit so far, and the company realized that events can be a gateway to introduce new users to the communities at the heart of the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, just dropping in and out of these audio conversations is not the end goal,&#8221; Ling said during a press event. Soon, servers will be able to list public events, inviting anybody to come check things out. Discord also says that its new discovery feature will launch with some noteworthy partners, hinting that “one rhymes with…… rhymes.” (It’s Grimes.)</p>
<p>Discord has a few other new features around the corner too. Threaded conversations are on the way this summer and the company is about to begin a pilot program to test paid, ticketed audio events. The latter could be a huge boon for creators, who haven&#8217;t been able to make money through the platform previously, and an important extra revenue stream for a platform that has no plans to get into the targeted advertising game.</p>
<h2>Discord&#8217;s next evolution</h2>
<p>Stage Discovery is a bit of a departure for Discord. Previously, to check out a live event, you needed to pop into a server first. Because the platform is so community-based, people interested in a topic, say a particular Twitch streamer, often hop directly into those servers from elsewhere. Discord does have some discovery and search functionality — users can thumb through popular and featured public servers in its Discover tab — but historically it’s been relatively basic. But by expanding the “discovery surface,” Discord is likely to attract a lot of people who either haven’t heard of the app or think it’s just a voice chat utility for gamers.</p>
<p>Discord is obviously taking notes from Clubhouse here — live audio event discovery is Clubhouse&#8217;s whole<em> thing</em> — but Discord&#8217;s deep well of interest-based communities stands to push its own experience far beyond what the newer audio upstart can offer. The company also has a five year head start and universal brand recognition with young people: Discord says it has 150 million monthly active users and most of them are 18-24 year-olds that comprise a big chunk of Gen Z. Discord doesn&#8217;t really need to compete with Clubhouse — in many ways, it was there first.</p>

<p>Discord&#8217;s new discovery feature will show up in the home tab, offering a directory of live voice events. The feature’s real promise is that those events can bring new users into the fold, connecting them to thriving communities that have a lot more going on beyond events. Users will be able to see voice events at which their friends are hanging, events that servers they belong to are hosting and other live events that they aren’t connected to.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, this is still really a window into communities and how to join communities,” Discord Product Marketing spokesperson Jesse Wofford told TechCrunch. Wofford emphasized that Discord isn’t trying to lure anybody into an endless scrolling loop — instead the goal is connecting users with the vibrant communities for which the platform is known.</p>

<h2>Discord grows up</h2>
<p>Discord is also celebrating its sixth birthday by sprucing up its brand a little, brightening its color scheme and making a few tweaks to its apparently beloved anthropomorphized little purple controller dude, Clyde. (Discord insists that Clyde is “blurple.”) The company says it wants to keep things playful while making its visual identity “more inclusive and welcoming” to the kind of people who haven’t been using the app for years.</p>
<p>While a big boost to discovery is on the near horizon, Discord’s product philosophy hasn’t changed. “There are no feeds, no likes, no way for anything to go viral,&#8221; Discord founder and CEO Jason Citron said, adding that Discord was designed with community building in mind from day one.</p>
<p>Discord wasn’t always such a welcoming place. The app has always served gamers, but it was also a<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/technology/discord-chat-app-alt-right.html"> haven for white supremacists</a>, including the ones who organized the Charlottesville rally that left Heather Heyer dead. In a not-so-distant past life, dangerous far-right extremism thrived on Discord, even as the company largely avoided the bad headlines that slammed more mainstream social platforms for facilitating hate.</p>
<p>Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/28/17062554/discord-alt-right-neo-nazi-white-supremacy-atomwaffen">rooted out neo-Nazis</a> and other dangerous communities starting in 2017, and by 2021 the company was well-positioned to tell a different story. Now, 15% of the company works on its Trust and Safety team, a group dedicated to protecting users and shaping content moderation policies. The product was built for gamers from the get-go, but Discord has been broadening its horizons recently and started having conversations with users about how it’s helped them fight isolation during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s aspirations ultimately go well beyond the gaming community. Unlike Instagram’s ad-choked social feed or Twitter’s often brain-melting endless feed, Discord remains a joy to use. And all of that user-friendliness doesn’t appear to be a bait and switch either. Revenue from its Nitro premium product and other paid perks are growing fast and the company has no plans for targeted ads.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s savvy pandemic-era campaign to broaden Discord’s appeal to nongaming communities — musicians, study groups, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/3uFgJhu">surrealist fantasy baseball leagues</a> — appears to be paying off. Discord’s user numbers are explosive and the company is adding sensible new features at a healthy clip. The outlook is good for the company and its users alike, and what a rare convergence that is.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the old software world — think Oracle and SAP — sales were the competitive advantage. Today, we live in a world of product-led growth, where engineers (and the software they have built) are the biggest differentiator. If your customers love what you’re building, you’re headed in the right direction. If they don’t, you’re not.</p>
<p>However, even the most successful product-led growth companies will reach a tipping point, because no matter how good their product is, they’ll need to figure out how to expand their customer base and grow from a startup into a $1 billion+ revenue enterprise.</p>
<p>The answer is the hamburger model. Why call it that? Because the best go-to-market (GTM) strategies for startups are like hamburgers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The bottom bun:</strong> Bottom-up GTM.</li>
<li><strong>The burger</strong>: Your product.</li>
<li><strong>The top bun:</strong> Enterprise sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the hamburger GTM model, your product is the meat. We’ll go through each layer before talking about some of the best ways to implement the model successfully at your company.</p>
<h2>The hamburger model</h2>
<p><strong>The meat — product at the center</strong>: The hamburger model starts with a great product. As a founder, this means you don’t need to think about revenue on Day One. You do, however, need to obsess over your customers, what they want and how to build it. Nothing is more important.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom bun —</strong> <strong>users not leads:</strong> In a top-down sales model, marketing creates leads that are then converted into sales by enterprise reps. In a bottom-up model, marketing creates users, not leads, and those users are never touched by sales. For companies that have been customer-obsessed from the very beginning because they built something people love, this bottom-up model can feel far more natural and fuel a successful business.</p>
<p><strong>The top bun —</strong> <strong>building enterprise sales:</strong> Even the best bottom-up sales models aren’t enough on their own, and every company eventually needs top-down sales. It may sound counterintuitive, but even the companies most famous for their bottom-up approaches now have enterprise sales teams. That’s because there are certain types of customers — for example, healthcare, insurance and government — that require salespeople to engage with due to compliance and security reasons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the basic elements of the hamburger GTM model: A killer product that sets you apart, a bottom-up sales strategy to convert users into paying customers, and a sales team to go after bigger customers that require more attention.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Retail giant Walmart <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/05/13/walmart-announces-plans-to-acquire-zeekit-a-leading-virtual-fitting-room-platform-to-enable-enhanced-and-social-shopping-experience-for-customer">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s acquiring the Tel Aviv-based startup <a href="https://zeekit.me/">Zeekit</a>, which allows consumers to virtually &#8220;try on&#8221; clothing when shopping online. The company leverages a combination of real-time image processing, computer vision, deep learning and other AI technology to show shoppers how they would look in an item by way of a simulation that takes into account body dimensions, fit, size and even the fabric of the garment itself.</p>
<p>Deal terms were not disclosed. According to data from PitchBook, Zeekit had raised over $24 million in outside capital, but we&#8217;ve confirmed that&#8217;s inaccurate. Zeekit <a href="https://jewishbusinessnews.com/2016/09/15/israeli-startup-zeekit-the-most-advanced-virtual-fitting-room-app-raises-9-million/">raised a $9 million Series A</a> in 2016, and has raised a total of $16 million since 2014.</p>
<p>The company had already been working with a range of retailers and brands ahead of the acquisition, including Walmart, as well Macy&#8217;s, Asos, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas and others. It had once <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/09/rebecca-minkoffs-fashion-week-show-uses-augmented-reality-to-help-real-women-shop-the-look-live/">worked with Rebecca Minkoff during Fashion Week</a> to help women shop the show&#8217;s looks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zeekit was founded in 2013 by CEO Yael Vizel, VP of Research and Development Nir Appleboim and CTO Alon Kristal, with the premise that if online shoppers could see how clothing would look on their own bodies, the technology could reduce the rate of returns due to non-fitting, non-flattering items.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151668" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151668" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2151668" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/download.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Walmart says customers will be able to use the Zeekit technology to virtually try on items from brands including Free People, Champion, Levi Strauss, ELOQUII Elements, Free Assembly, Scoop, Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara, plus its own private label brands, like Time and Tru, Terra &amp; Sky, Wonder Nation and George.</p>
<p>When the technology goes live on Walmart.com, customers can choose to upload an image of their own or choose from a series of models that best represent their height, shape and skin tone in order to see themselves virtually in any item of clothing. The goal is to provide a similar experience to trying on clothing when shopping online as you would otherwise have had when in a retail store.</p>
<p>Shoppers will also be able to share their virtual outfits with friends for a second opinion, via the new integration, adding the social element back into online shopping.</p>
<p>In addition to the virtual try-on, Walmart says Zeekit&#8217;s technology may be used to build other fashion experiences over time, including a virtual closet experience where you could mix and match styles.</p>
<p>With the deal&#8217;s closure, Zeekit&#8217;s three co-founders will be joining Walmart.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re confident that with the team’s expertise in bringing real-time image technologies, computer vision and artificial intelligence to the world of fashion, we’ll identify even more ways to innovate for our customers in our continued effort to be the first-choice destination for fashion,&#8221; said Denise Incandela, Walmart U.S. EVP of Apparel and Private Brands, in an <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/05/13/walmart-announces-plans-to-acquire-zeekit-a-leading-virtual-fitting-room-platform-to-enable-enhanced-and-social-shopping-experience-for-customer">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Walmart in years past had heavily invested in apparel, including by acquiring online brands like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/16/walmart-to-buy-bonobos-for-310m-in-its-bigger-push-into-fashion-retail/">Bonobos</a>, ModCloth, Eloquii and others, and even tried offering some brands, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/05/bonobos-and-nike-get-their-own-branded-shops-on-walmarts-jet-com/">Nike</a>, their own shop on Walmart. com. Not all of these efforts paid off. <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/walmart-sells-modcloth-to-financial-firm/564464/">Walmart sold ModCloth</a> only a couple of years after buying it, for example, after ModCloth customers balked at being owned by a retail giant, and the brand remained unprofitable. More recently, Walmart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/09/rebecca-minkoffs-fashion-week-show-uses-augmented-reality-to-help-real-women-shop-the-look-live/">partnered</a> with online consignment shop ThredUP to list a large number of secondhand items on Walmart&#8217;s website.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pF8QSNXXds"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/4-views-on-the-future-of-retail-the-check-out-process-and-lines/">4 views on the future of retail and the shopping experience</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 views on the future of retail and the shopping experience&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/4-views-on-the-future-of-retail-the-check-out-process-and-lines/embed/#?secret=pF8QSNXXds" data-secret="pF8QSNXXds" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition to the struggles around profitability, apparel more broadly has been a harder area for online retail to get right, often because of the difficulties involved with picking out items that have to fit unique bodies and the non-standard sizing fashion designers use &#8212; meaning clothing can run smaller or larger, depending on a given brand, even when shopping &#8220;your size.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another factor that may have impacted the acquisition was the pandemic, which pushed e-commerce years ahead, as retailers closed their doors and consumers stayed home to shop online due the circumstances of the health crisis. During this time, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/amazon-unseats-walmart-to-become-the-no-1-apparel-retailer-in-the-us.html?">Amazon passed Walmart</a> as the top apparel retailer in the U.S., according to Wells Fargo, which estimated its apparel and footwear sales grew 15% in 2020 to over $41 billion, or 20-25% higher than Walmart.</p>
<p>Walmart didn&#8217;t say when Zeekit would go live on Walmart&#8217;s website, only that it would show up &#8220;soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>We understand that, post-acquisition, Walmart will not continue to operate Zeekit’s existing business. Zeekit will work with their current customers on a transition plan.</p>
<p><em>Updated 5/13/21, 11:05 AM ET with more accurate funding totals. Previously we noted PitchBook data. We&#8217;ve since confirmed the figures directly. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blubracket.com/">BluBracket</a>, an early-stage startup that focuses on keeping source code repositories secure, even in distributed environments, announced a $12 million Series A today.</p>
<p>Evolution Equity Partners led the round, with help from existing investors Unusual Ventures, Point72 Ventures, SignalFire and Firebolt Ventures. When combined with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/blubracket-scores-6-5m-seed-to-help-secure-code-in-distributed-environments/">$6.5 million seed round</a> we reported on last year, the company has raised $19.5 million so far.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, being able to secure code in distributed environments came in quite handy when much of the technology world moved to work from home last year. BluBracket co-founder and COO Ajay Arora says that the pandemic forced many organizations to look carefully at how they secured their code base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So the anxiety organizations had about making sure their source code was secure and that it wasn&#8217;t leaking, from that standpoint that was a big tailwind for us. [With companies moving to a] completely remote development workforce, and with code being so important to their business as intellectual property, they needed to get that visibility into what vulnerabilities were there,&#8221; Arora explained.</p>
<p>Even prior to the pandemic, the company was finding they were gaining traction with developers and security pros by using a bottom up approach offering a free community version of the software. Having that free version as a top of the funnel for their sales motion was also helpful once COVID hit full force.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2020 was a disaster, but the pandemic put security in the spotlight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/2020-was-a-disaster-but-the-pandemic-put-security-in-the-spotlight/embed/#?secret=zRMcejaEB6" data-secret="zRMcejaEB6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, Arora says the company has multiple thousands of developers, DevOps and SecOps users across dozens of organizations using the company&#8217;s suite of products. The big reference company right now is Priceline, but he says there are other big names that would prefer not to be public about it.</p>
<p>The company currently has 30 employees, with plans to double that by the end of the year, and he says that building diversity and inclusion into the hiring process is part of the company&#8217;s core values, and part of how the executive team gets measured.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re big believers in putting our money where our mouth is and one of the OKRs for me and my co-founder [CEO Prakash Linga], or one of the things that we&#8217;re actually compensated for, is how well we are doing in building diversity and inclusion on the team,&#8221; he said. He adds that the recruiters that they are using are also being held to the same standard when it comes to providing a diverse set of candidates for open positions.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2018 and the founding team came from Vera, a startup that helped secure documents in motion. That company <a href="https://www.helpsystems.com/about/news/helpsystems-acquires-vera-broaden-data-security-portfolio">was sold to HelpSystems in December 2020</a> after Arora and Linga had left to start BluBracket.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Companies across the United States should be closely following the California State Legislature hearings on the “Silenced No More Act,” which would prevent the use of nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence employees from speaking up about all forms of discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>The legislation was introduced in response to the stunning claims brought forward by former Pinterest employees alleging a pattern of racial and gender discrimination, harassment and retaliation. They courageously called attention to the hypocrisy of Pinterest’s aspirational comments on social issues even though the company had required them to sign NDAs.</p>
<p>As attorneys who work with shareholders to hold companies accountable for this misconduct, these allegations have deeply impacted our work. They formed the basis of an ongoing shareholder derivative lawsuit that a state pension fund we represent brought against Pinterest’s board of directors and top executives for participating in and otherwise protecting powerful executives who are alleged to have discriminated against Pinterest employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Failure to recognize this necessity will lead to future corporate scandals as multiple accounts of the same type of misconduct in the workplace come to light.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The Silenced No More Act would extend existing laws that limit the use of NDAs. Such laws are important because NDAs are intended to protect executives by keeping their harassment, discrimination and retaliation under wraps. That NDAs chill the voices of employees who have already been victimized makes them even more toxic. NDAs cause women to fear reprisal from the company, sometimes even incorporating financial penalty clauses, long after their individual claims have been resolved.</p>
<p>The Silenced No More Act should pass swiftly and be a model for other states, but this is what all companies throughout the country should be doing on their own, rather than waiting for legislation to drag an ethical NDA policy out of them.</p>
<p>Failure to recognize this necessity will lead to future corporate scandals as multiple accounts of the same type of misconduct in the workplace come to light. It will continue to uphold an unsustainable corporate system where executives in positions of power assume they will be protected no matter how unlawful their behavior toward others in the workplace.</p>
<p>We have seen from our investigations the compounding impacts of NDAs and how they allow problems to fester over years.</p>
<p>The two of us, working with others and on behalf of Alphabet shareholders, were part of the team that led a groundbreaking <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/alphabet-settles-shareholder-lawsuit-.html">$310 million settlement</a> with the tech company that led to historic diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) reforms at the company. That settlement was the result of a shareholder derivative lawsuit where stockholders alleged that executives and board members violated their fiduciary duties by enabling a double standard that allowed executives to sexually harass and discriminate against women without consequence.</p>
<p>In that case, we believe Alphabet’s “culture of concealment” was driven in large part by the silencing effects of NDAs.</p>
<p>The duration of misconduct, enabled by NDAs, goes far beyond Alphabet and Pinterest. There is no shortage of #MeToo scandals at powerful companies, many with presences in California, that were exacerbated by muzzling NDAs. Weinstein Company, Wynn Resorts, NBC and 21st Century Fox are prominent examples of companies that first tried to keep allegations quiet through the use of NDAs and later faced a firestorm of allegations from former employees.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the landscape surrounding discrimination and harassment in the workplace is changing. Shareholders, workers, customers and other key business stakeholders are becoming more active in demanding that companies stop protecting harassers.</p>
<p>All of this should send a message to boards and C-suite executives that they must set the tone from the top and they are far better off being proactive than reactive. That means actively creating a company culture where DEI is a foundational component &#8212; not an afterthought. It also means intentionally prioritizing transparency and proactively doing away with policies that are antithetical to that goal, like NDAs that are intentionally designed to suppress the voices of employees.</p>
<p>The public and shareholders want to be associated with companies that do right by their employees. Business should recognize this change from a culture of compliance to one of equity and inclusion and embrace this new reality by stopping the practice of requiring complainants to enter into NDAs and fostering a culture of inclusion and accountability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More money for the now very buzzy business of reshaping how people work: <a href="https://worksome.eu">Worksome</a> is announcing it recently closed a $13 million Series A funding round for its &#8220;freelance talent platform&#8221; &#8212; after racking up 10x growth in revenue since January 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a remote working boom.</p>
<p>The 2017 founded startup, which has a couple of ex-Googlers in its leadership team, has built a platform to connect freelancers looking for professional roles with employers needing tools to find and manage freelancer talent.</p>
<p>It says it&#8217;s seeing traction with large enterprise customers that have traditionally used Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to manage and pay external workforces &#8212; and views employment agency giants like Randstad, Adecco and Manpower as ripe targets for disruption.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Most multinational enterprises manage flexible workers using legacy MSPs,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Morten Petersen (one of the Xooglers). &#8220;These largely analogue businesses manage complex compliance and processes around hiring and managing freelance workforces with handheld processes and outdated technology that is not built for managing fluid workforces. Worksome tackles this industry head on with a better, faster and simpler solution to manage large freelancer and contractor workforces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worksome focuses on helping medium/large companies &#8212; who are working with at least 20+ freelancers at a time &#8212; fill vacancies within teams rather than helping companies outsource projects, per Petersen, who suggests the latter is the focus for the majority of freelancer platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worksome helps [companies] onboard people who will provide necessary skills and will be integral to longer-term business operations. It makes matches between companies and skilled freelancers, which the businesses go on to trust, form relationships with and come back to time and time again,&#8221; he goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;When companies hire dozens or hundreds of freelancers at one time, processes can get very complicated,&#8221; he adds, arguing that on compliance and payments Worksome &#8220;takes on a much greater responsibility than other freelancing platforms to make big hires easier&#8221;.</p>
<p>The startup also says it&#8217;s concerned with looking out for (and looking after) its freelancer talent pool &#8212; saying it wants to create &#8220;a world of meaningful work&#8221; on its platform, and ensure freelancers are paid fairly and competitively. (And also that they are paid faster than they otherwise might be, given it takes care of their payroll so they don&#8217;t have to chase payments from employers.)</p>
<p>The business started life in Copenhagen &#8212; and its Series A has a distinctly Nordic flavor, with investment coming from the Danish business angel and investor on the local version of the <em>Dragons&#8217; Den</em> TV program Løvens Hule; the former Minister for Higher Education and Science, Tommy Ahlers; and family home manufacturer Lind &amp; Risør.</p>
<p>It had raised just under $6M prior to thus round, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/worksome/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, and also counts some (unnamed) Google executives among its earlier investors.</p>
<p>Freelancer platforms (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/upwork-ipo/">marketplaces</a>) aren&#8217;t new, of course. There are also an increasing number of players in this space &#8212; buoyed by a <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">new flush of VC dollars chasing the &#8216;future of work&#8217;, whatever hybrid home-office flexible shape that might take. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So Worksome is by no means alone in offering tech tools to streamline the interface between freelancers and businesses.</span></p>
<p>A few others that spring to mind include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/lystable-takes-10m-top-up-to-tackle-freelancer-payments/">Lystable</a> (now Kalo), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/malt-raises-28-6-million-for-its-freelancer-platform/">Malt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/fiverr-business/">Fiverr</a> &#8212; or, for techie job matching specifically, the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/hackerrank-raises-30m-to-match-developers-with-jobs/">HackerRank</a> &#8212; plus, on the blue collar work side, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/jobandtalent-tops-up-with-108m-for-its-workforce-as-a-service-platform/">Jobandtalent</a>. There&#8217;s also a growing number of startups focusing on helping freelancer teams specifically (e.g. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/collective-launches-a-saas-marketplace-for-freelancer-teams/">Collective</a>), so there&#8217;s a trend towards increasing specialism.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Collective launches a SaaS marketplace for freelancer teams&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/collective-launches-a-saas-marketplace-for-freelancer-teams/embed/#?secret=wlGOHLe2bv" data-secret="wlGOHLe2bv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Worksome says it differentiates vs other players (legacy and startups) by combining services like tax compliance, background and ID checks and handling payroll and other admin with an AI powered platform that matches talent to projects.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not the only startup offering to do the back-office admin/payroll piece, either, nor the only one using AI to match skilled professionals to projects. But it claims it&#8217;s going further than rival &#8216;freelancer-as-a-service&#8217; platforms &#8212; saying it wants to &#8220;address the entire value chain&#8221; (aka: &#8220;everything from the hiring of freelance talent to onboarding and payment&#8221;).</p>
<p>Worksome has 550 active clients (i.e. employers in the market for freelancer talent) at this stage; and has accepted 30,000 freelancers into its marketplace so far.</p>
<p>Its current talent pool can take on work across 12 categories, and collectively offers more than 39,000 unique skills, per Petersen.</p>
<p>The biggest categories of freelancer talent on the platform are in Software and IT; Design and Creative Work; Finance and Management Consulting; plus &#8220;a long tail of niche skills&#8221; within engineering and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>While its largest customers are found in the creative industries, tech and IT, pharma and consumer goods. And its biggest markets are the U.K. and U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are currently trailing at +20,000 yearly placements,&#8221; says Petersen, adding: &#8220;The average yearly spend per client is $300,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worksome says the Series A funding will go on stoking growth by investing in marketing. It also plans to spend on product dev and on building out its team globally (it also has offices in London and New York).</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months the startup doubled the size of its team to 50 &#8212; and wants to do so again within 12 months so it can ramp up its enterprise client base in the U.S., U.K. and euro-zone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are a lot of freelancer platforms out there but a lot of these don’t appreciate that hiring is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to reducing the friction in working with freelancers,&#8221; argues Petersen. &#8220;Of the time that goes into hiring, managing and paying freelancers, 75% is currently spent on admin such as timesheet approvals, invoicing and compliance checks, leaving only a tiny fraction of time to actually finding talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worksome woos employers with a &#8220;one-click-hire&#8221; offer &#8212; touting its ability to find and hire freelancers &#8220;within seconds&#8221;.</p>
<p>If hiring a stranger in seconds sounds ill-advised, Worksome greases this external employment transaction by taking care of vetting the freelancers itself (including carrying out background checks; and using proprietary technology to asses freelancers&#8217; skills and suitability for its marketplace).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a two-step vetting process to ensure that we only allow the best freelance talent onto the Worksome platform,&#8221; Petersen tells TechCrunch. &#8220;For step one, an inhouse-built robot assesses our freelancer applicants. It analyses their skillset, social media profiles, profile completeness and hourly or daily rate, as well as their CV and work history, to decide whether each person is a good fit for Worksome.</p>
<p>&#8220;For step two, our team of talent specialists manually review and decline or approve the freelancers that pass through step one with a score of 85% or more. We have just approved our 30,000th freelancer and will be able to both scale and improve our vetting procedure as we grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>A majority of freelancer applicants fail Worksome&#8217;s proprietary vetting processes. This is clear because it says it has received 80,000 applicants so far &#8212; but only approved 30,000.</p>
<p>That raises interesting questions about how it&#8217;s making decisions on who is (and isn&#8217;t) an &#8216;appropriate fit&#8217; for its talent marketplace.</p>
<p>It says its candidate assessing &#8220;robot&#8221; looks at &#8220;whether freelancers can demonstrate the skillset, matching work history, industry experience and profile depth&#8221; deemed necessary to meet its quality criteria &#8212; giving the example that it would not accept a freelancer who says they can lead complex IT infrastructure projects if they do not have evidence of relevant work, education and skills.</p>
<p>On the AI freelancer-to-project matching side, Worksome says its technology aims to match<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> freelancers &#8220;who have the highest likelihood of completing a job with high satisfaction, based on their work-history, and performance and skills used on previous jobs&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This creates a feedback loop that&#8230; ensure that both clients and freelancers are matched with great people and great work,&#8221; is its circular suggestion when we ask about this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But it also emphasizes that its AI is not making hiring decisions on its own &#8212; and is only ever supporting humans in making a choice. (An interesting caveat since existing EU data protection rules, under Article 22 of the GDPR, provide for a right for individuals to object to automated decision making if significant decisions are being taken without meaningful human interaction.) </span></p>
<p>Using automation technologies (like AI) to make assessments that determine whether a person gains access to employment opportunities or doesn&#8217;t can certainly risk scaled discrimination. So the devil really is in the detail of how these algorithmic assessments are done.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why such uses of technology are set to face close regulatory scrutiny in the European Union &#8212; under incoming rules on &#8216;high risk&#8217; users of artificial intelligence &#8212; including the use of AI to match candidates to jobs.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">current legislative proposals</a> in this area specifically categorize &#8220;employment, workers management and access to self-employment&#8221; as a high risk use of AI, meaning applications like Worksome are likely to face some of the highest levels of regulatory supervision in the future.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Worksome is bullish when we ask about the risks associated with using AI as an intermediary for employment opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We utilise fairly advanced matching algorithms to very effectively shortlist candidates for a role based solely on objective criteria, rinsed from human bias,&#8221; claims Petersen. &#8220;Our algorithms don&#8217;t take into account gender, ethnicity, name of educational institutions or other aspects that are usually connected to human bias.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;AI has immense potential in solving major industry challenges such as recruitment bias, low worker mobility and low access to digital skills among small to medium sized businesses. We are firm believers that technology should be utilized to remove human bias’ from any hiring process,&#8221; he goes on, adding: &#8220;Our tech was built to this very purpose from the beginning, and the new proposed legislation has the potential to serve as a validator for the hard work we’ve put into this.</p>
<p>&#8220;The obvious potential downside would be if new legislation would limit innovation by making it harder for startups to experiment with new technologies. As always, legislation like this will impact the Davids more than the Goliaths, even though the intentions may have been the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zooming back out to consider the pandemic-fuelled remote working boom, Worksome confirms that most of the projects for which it supplied freelancers last year were conducted remotely.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are currently seeing a slow shift back towards a combination of remote and onsite work and expect this combination to stick amongst most of our clients,&#8221; Petersen goes on. </span>&#8220;Whenever we are in uncertain economic times, we see a rise in the number of freelancers that companies are using. However, this trend is dwarfed by a much larger overall trend towards flexible work, which drives the real shift in the market. This shift has been accelerated by COVID-19 but has been underway for many years.</p>
<p>&#8220;While remote work has unlocked an enormous potential for accessing talent everywhere, 70% of the executives expect to use more temporary workers and contractors onsite than they did before COVID-19, according to a recent McKinsey study. This shows that businesses really value the flexibility in using an on-demand workforce of highly skilled specialists that can interact directly with their own teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked whether it&#8217;s expecting growth in freelancing to sustain even after we (hopefully) move beyond the pandemic &#8212; including if there&#8217;s a return to physical offices &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Petersen</span> suggests the underlying trend is for businesses to need increased flexibility, regardless of the exact blend of full-time and freelancer staff. So platforms like Worksome are confidently poised to keep growing.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you ask business leaders, 90% believe that shifting their talent model to a blend of full-time and freelancers can give a future competitive advantage (Source: BCG),&#8221; he says. &#8220;We see two major trends driving this sentiment; access to talent, and building an agile and flexible organization. This has become all the more true during the pandemic &#8212; a high degree of flexibility is allowing organisations to better navigate both the initial phase of the pandemic as well the current pick up of business activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the amount of change that we’re currently seeing in the world, and with businesses are constantly re-inventing themselves, the access to highly skilled and flexible talent is absolutely essential &#8212; now, in the next 5 years, and beyond.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX&#8217;s bourgeoning Starlink satellite-based broadband internet service just got a big boost from a significant new partner: Google Cloud. Thanks to a new partnership between the two, SpaceX will now be locating Starlink ground stations right within Google&#8217;s existing data centers, providing the Starlink network with direct access to ground-based network infrastructure to help facilitate network connections for customers who are on the edges of the footprint of existing network access.</p>
<p>Starlink&#8217;s entire aim is to provide reliable, broadband-quality connections to areas that have typically be hard or impossible to reach with legacy ground-based network infrastructure, including cellular networks. The tie-up with Google means that not only will business and public sector customers taking advantage of that new network reach have access to internet connections, but also to cloud-based infrastructure and applications, including AI and machine learning capabilities, analytics and more.</p>
<p>This should not only bolster Starlink&#8217;s reliability in terms of its consumer clients, but also provide key capabilities for serving enterprise customers — another key target demographic for the growing Starlink business, though much of the public focus thus far for Starlink&#8217;s roll-out has been on residential access across its expanding beta.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google and Starlink expect to begin to become available to enterprise customers soon — sometime pin the &#8220;second half of 2021&#8221; according to a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-cloud-and-spacexs-starlink-to-deliver-secure-global-connectivity-301290801.html"> press release</a> issued by the companies.</p>
<p>SpaceX has been very aggressive in building out the Starlink network in the past few months, launching 480 in just around there months. All that in-space infrastructure build out could well have been pre-amble to this collaboration and enterprise-focused service launch, in addition to helping SpaceX expand Starlink consumer service quality and availability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://liquiddeath.com/">Liquid Death</a>, a  four-year-old, LA-based canned mountain water startup that has steadily garnered market share and press coverage by promising, amusingly, to &#8220;murder your thirst,&#8221; just raised $15 million in Series C funding. The round brings the company&#8217;s total backing to date to $50 million.</p>
<p>The new financing &#8212; it follows a $23 million Series B round last fall &#8212; was seemingly about getting more strategic partners involved with the brand. Most meaningfully, Live Nation, the giant concert promoter, just became an equity investor and, as part of the deal, will only sell Liquid Death across its venues and festivals across the United States for a period of time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big deal. Though Liquid Death has done pretty well on its own in terms of its distribution &#8212; it says its water is now carried in 16,000 locations throughout the U.S., including bars, tattoo parlors, cafes, local liquor stores and &#8220;big box&#8221; stores like Whole Foods, Walmart and 7-Eleven &#8212; Live Nation connects the brand with a massive and captive audience. Specifically, Live Nation says that in a typical (not COVID) year, it brings in 100 million fans to events across more than 120 Live Nation-owned-and-operated venues and festivals across the U.S. (Because Liquid Death comes in recyclable aluminum cans versus far-less recyclable plastic bottles, the tie-up is a good look for Live Nation, too.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Liquid Death co-founder and CEO Mike Cessario, a former creative director and copywriter, declined yesterday to say how much Live Nation plans to charge for his products. But he did confirm that because the now 60-person company has &#8220;seen a ton of growth in retail and online in the past year,&#8221; it &#8220;didn’t need to raise a ton of cash right now.&#8221; In fact, he noted that as a &#8220;maturing&#8221; startup, Liquid Death now has &#8220;more access to favorable debt terms for working capital&#8221; should it go that route at some point.</p>

<p>Other investors in the new round include Tony Hawk, Wiz Khalifa, Steve Aoki, Hulu president Kelly Campbell and Dollar Shave Club founder Michael Dubin.</p>
<p>Cessario says the new funding won&#8217;t be used to expand internationally &#8212; not yet. Though Liquid Death is available in Canada and receives &#8220;tons of requests on social for international expansion,&#8221; the company is &#8220;focused on conquering the U.S. and Canada for the time being,&#8221; he tells us. As for branching out into new products, he says the team is &#8220;exploring some ideas like limited-release flavors for later this year.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-might-be-the-fastest-growth-story-of-this-era/">While a unicorn named Hopin</a> tends to dominate the virtual conferencing space, a new startup just raised millions of dollars by focusing on what it believes is an untapped niche in the same universe: academic conferences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.morressier.com/">Morressier</a>, a virtual conference and publishing platform specifically for the scientific community, announced today that it has raised $18 million in a Series A round led by Owl Ventures. Existing investors Cherry Ventures and Redalpine Venture Partners also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/samibln?lang=en">Sami Benchekroun</a> spent a lot of time at medical and scientific conferences while growing up thanks to his parents, who were both pursuing careers in medicine. Eventually, he began recognizing a pattern between all of the conferences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“People from around the world would come together and literally bring physical content like printed out posters [or] a presentation on USB keys, to these conferences, but after the three days, all that content is lost,” he said. “All the people [who] are working on cancer research and HIV research are coming to these conferences completely offline, sharing the ideas, and then everything is lost.”</p>
<p>The irony of it was distracting so, in 2014, he began trying to digitize the early exchange of knowledge at a conference.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tired of &#8216;Zoom University&#8217;? So is edtech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/edtech-zoom-university/embed/#?secret=pilSWYTrHi" data-secret="pilSWYTrHi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Democratizing sounds cheesy but it&#8217;s really that,” he said. “People from Africa or Asia have no chance to really get access to these really high profile conferences that are mainly happening in the States or Europe, so by actually making everything digital, we can give back.”</p>
<p>The company began with a focus on content ephemerality, and nearly 7 years later, Morressier has built an end-to-end software layer that it hopes makes the academic conference experience as cutting edge as the research within it.</p>
<p>First, Morressier works with a society to create a landing page for an upcoming conference. Researchers can apply there to present their research at said conference. Morressier then aggregates all the research submissions and begins conducting a peer review process, with academics from the society validating the research and deciding if its relevant. The peer review process can often happen offline on excel sheets and word documents, so Morressier helps move the entire operations online. Once the peer review is done, the startup creates a content library to go along with a virtual or in-person conference where it can live indefinitely.</p>
<p>Finally, it gets to hosting the dissemination of that content to giving post-event analytics to event hosts to understand how research is being consumed.</p>
<p>“In order to make a compelling, end to end solution for every society out there, we added that live stream video component only in the beginning of 2020,” he said.</p>

<p>Morressier has over 700,000 accounts on its service, and has held conferences with the American Chemical Society and the Society of Photo-optical Instrumentation Engineers among others. The company makes money by working directly with the societies and charging them a flat fee for using the platform conference organization and managing their peer review process. It also has a per document-based fee structure so as more research is uploaded to its database, Morressier makes more money.</p>

<p>While growth is the obvious next step for the freshly-funded company, Morressier hasn’t been exactly sluggish in the meantime. The company had 6x growth in number of authors and 13x growth in number of documents on its platform, bringing on $4.5 million in sales in 2020. The early-stage startup began 2020 with a 28-person staff, and plans to grow to 100 people by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The founder, of course, accounts part of this growth to the pandemic, which took down some of the natural red tape that exists in education.</p>
<p>“I always try to play this down but quite frankly, in research and education, unfortunately things take longer [because of] government structures,” he said, of adoption speed. Indeed, the company took four years to raise its first check due to development. Now, three years after that, Morressier has closed another tranche of capital, thanks to a global understanding that virtual events are the future. Now, it&#8217;s just time for Morressier to prove its pandemic bump has paved a way for it to become a high-growth business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku today announced the launch of its own original programming, which will initially become available to viewers in the U.S., U.K., and Canada through the media platform&#8217;s free streaming hub, The Roku Channel, starting on May 20th. The debut lineup will include 30 titles, including both the scripted and reality programming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/roku-acquires-quibis-content/">Roku had acquired</a> from the short-form streaming service Quibi earlier this year, following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/quibi-is-dead/">shutdown</a>.</p>
<p>Quibi, of course, had launched at an inopportune time for a service that was designed for on-the-go viewing, when it arrived <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/05/quibi-launches-its-mobile-streaming-service-in-the-middle-of-the-quarantine-era/">in the middle of a pandemic</a>. But some <a href="https://www.cnet.com/reviews/quibi-review/">have argued</a> that much of Quibi&#8217;s content <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/the-bites-are-quick-and-bad.html">wasn&#8217;t compelling</a> enough to pull in the number of subscribers to make the service a success. It will be interesting to see how well that same content now fares on Roku where it will no longer be &#8220;mobile-first,&#8221; but will more likely be streamed on a big-screen TV.</p>
<p>Among the better-known Quibi shows that will now be joining Roku are Chrissy Teigen&#8217;s &#8220;Chrissy&#8217;s Court,&#8221; Comedy Central&#8217;s &#8220;Reno 911!,&#8221; Kevin Hart&#8217;s &#8220;Die Hart&#8221; action series, <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/quibi-first-emmys-wins-1234774206/">Emmy-winning</a> &#8220;FreeRayshawn,&#8221; documentaries “Blackballed” and “Big Rad Wolf,” and reality show reboot &#8220;Punk&#8217;d.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These and others will become Roku&#8217;s first original programs, joining the over 40,000 other free movies and TV shows on <a href="https://therokuchannel.roku.com/">The Roku Channel.</a> This free streaming hub has been growing rapidly, in part due to the pandemic which forced people to stay at home, but also because of broader demand for free streaming content.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2020, The Roku Channel reached 63 million people in U.S. households, up more than 100% year-over-year. Streaming hours also doubled year-over-year &#8212; growth that&#8217;s twice as fast as the overall Roku platform itself, the company notes. In the first quarter of 2021, The Roku Channel grew to reach an estimated 70 million people.</p>
<p>The full list of Roku Originals includes available for the May 20th launch include: #FreeRayshawn,&#8221; &#8220;About Face,&#8221; &#8220;Bad Ideas with Adam Devine,&#8221; &#8220;Barkitechture,&#8221; &#8220;Big Rad Wolf,&#8221; &#8220;Blackballed,&#8221; &#8220;Centerpiece,&#8221; &#8220;Chrissy’s Court,&#8221; &#8220;Cup of Joe,&#8221; &#8220;Die Hart,&#8221; &#8220;Dishmantled,&#8221;Dummy,&#8221; &#8220;Fight Like a Girl,&#8221; &#8220;Flipped, &#8220;The Fugitive,&#8221; &#8220;Gayme Show, &#8220;Iron Sharpens Iron,&#8221; &#8220;Last Looks, &#8220;Let’s Roll with Tony Greenhand,&#8221; &#8220;Most Dangerous Game,&#8221; Murder House Flip,&#8221; &#8220;Murder Unboxed,&#8221; &#8220;Nightgowns,&#8221; &#8220;Prodigy,&#8221; &#8220;Punk’d,&#8221; &#8220;Reno 911!,&#8221; &#8220;Royalties,&#8221; &#8220;Shape of Pasta,&#8221; &#8220;Thanks a Million,&#8221; and &#8220;You Ain’t Got These.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roku will market the shows to viewers inside The Roku Channel, through an ad unit below the left-side navigation on the Roku home screen, and even through a coveted slot in the navigation menu itself.</p>
<p>In addition to the 30 new programs launching in May, more Roku Originals will roll out over the course of 2021. In total, Roku acquired more than 75 titles from Quibi, in a deal that reportedly valued the content at <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/roku-acquires-quibi-shows-free-streaming-1234881238/">&#8220;significantly less&#8221; than $100 million.</a> That means Roku users will eventually gain access to the Quibi shows that had been in the pipeline, but never got a chance to debut.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QuMIPIGN7Ug" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Quibi&#8217;s content made sense for Roku because it was designed for ad-supported viewing and not because of Quibi&#8217;s mobile gimmicks &#8212; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-08-quibi-mobile-video-turnstyle.html">like &#8220;turnstyle&#8221;</a> which made both portrait and landscape orientations look great, or horror shows that <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/steven-spielberg-quibi-jeffrey-katzenberg-horror-1203237395/">only stream after dark</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always unique &#8216;stunt-y&#8217; ways to bring shows to life, and we will explore those for shows that make sense,&#8221; noted Roku VP Sweta Patel, who leads the company&#8217;s Engagement and Growth Marketing. &#8220;But it&#8217;s going to have to make sense for how our viewers view &#8212; which is primarily on a [Roku] device,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>In other words, Roku viewers won&#8217;t care about all the Quibi tricks, just the content itself. However, the shows will stream through The Roku Channel mobile app, for the subset of viewers who do watch on the go.</p>
<p>Roku will also leverage the existing ad breaks Quibi had built into its content, it says. That means after every 8 to 10-minute long &#8220;episode,&#8221; a one-minute ad will play. That&#8217;s still a lighter ad load than traditional TV, Patel notes. The same ad-selling structure that The Roku Channel uses today will also apply to Originals, including the potential for brand sponsorships.</p>
<p>While Roku believes the Originals can help to bring in a younger, 18-34 year-old demographic, it&#8217;s not necessarily signaling a plan to increase investments in exclusive, original programming like this. Instead, Roku will watch to see how the new content performs and then use those insights to add more content to The Roku Channel&#8217;s library over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;This really It was a unique opportunity for us to get some incredible content for our growing base. We are always sourcing content and &#8212; whether that&#8217;s producing it or acquiring it &#8212; it has to make sense for our AVOD business model,&#8221; says Patel. However, now that Roku has its own programming to offer, it will make sense for the company to roll out The Roku Channel to its global markets outside the U.S., U.K., and Canada.</p>
<p>The company wouldn&#8217;t comment on those plans.</p>
<p>Alongside the launch of Roku Originals, Roku also announced a partnership with Laugh Out Loud, the comedy brand founded by Kevin Hart. It will now bring the linear channel LOL! Network to The Roku Channel, joining the now over 190 live, linear channels featured on the service.</p>
