										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://attio.com">Attio</a>, a new CRM for people who are familiar with modern collaboration tools, such as <a href="https://www.airtable.com">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>. The startup wants to create a product that can hold all important information about your customers, suppliers and partners, but that is also flexible so that you can organize, view and manipulate data easily.</p>
<p>Attio raised a $7.7 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.pointnine.com">Point Nine</a> with participation from <a href="https://www.balderton.com">Balderton Capital</a> and <a href="https://headline.com">Headline</a>. <a href="https://www.passioncapital.com">Passion Capital</a>, who was already an investor in the company, as well as several angel investors, also participated in the round. Business angels include Front co-founder and CEO Mathilde Collin, Loom co-founder and CTO Vinay Hiremath, Loom and Hyper co-founder Sahed Khan and Indeed co-founder Paul Forster.</p>
<p>That’s a long list of investors and it shouldn’t come as a surprise when you look at the background of the founder. Attio’s co-founder and CEO Nicolas Sharp previous worked for Passion Capital as an associate and then created Attio with Alexander Christie. He spent a lot of time working on the firm’s deal flow process.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238863" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We think that there’s something incredible happening in business software in general and also in CRM in particular,” Sharp told me. He mentioned Airtable and Notion as inspiration. “It allows customers to build whatever they want.”</p>
<p>“We have that thing happening on one hand, which is interesting by itself. On the CRM market, we have this paradigm shift of this new way of selling things. It’s now all about fostering relationships through different channels,” he added.</p>
<p>In other words, CRM software is no longer restricted to sales teams. Now, many people working for company A interact with different people at company B. It becomes hard to keep track of what’s going on when you don’t have a single point of contact.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238866" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238866" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2238866" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238866" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Attio</p></div></p>
<p>Attio pulls data from your existing tools. When you set up your account, you import your team’s contacts. You can also sync email conversations with the CRM platform. You can choose between two sharing levels — metadata only, or subject lines and metadata. And, of course, you can also sync your calendar.</p>
<p>After that, Attio automatically enriches your data with more information from third-party sources, such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. You can view a timeline of your company’s recent interactions with a specific contact. You can also search for a company and view everybody you know at that company.</p>
<p>It gets particularly interesting when you start building collections. A collection is a list of contacts for a specific project. For instance, you can create a collection with all your investors, another collection with your sales funnel, another collection with reporters you know, etc.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to view a collection. Like in Airtable, you can choose to add data using a spreadsheet-like interface with rows and columns. You can add columns with new attributes that are relevant to your collection.</p>
<p>But you can also switch to kanban view and move contacts from one column to another. There’s also a calendar view. Each view is customizable with filters and a sorting criteria.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238865" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238865" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2238865" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238865" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Attio</p></div></p>
<p>Attio has been designed like most software-as-a-service tools, which means that it works well as a team. You can view recent activity in the activity tab, you can create tasks and add notes to start working on a project as a team.</p>
<p>The company has around 120 paid customers, such as teams working for Coca-Cola, Supercell, Saltpay, Causal and Upfront Ventures. What’s interesting is that Attio isn’t the only ‘new CRM’ trying to reinvent this software category. Other companies include <a href="https://www.folk.app">Folk</a>, which I’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/folk-helps-you-share-contacts-with-your-team/">recently profiled</a>, <a href="https://4degrees.ai">4Degrees</a> and <a href="https://www.affinity.co">Affinity</a>.</p>
<p>When Sharp started thinking about the product, the competitive landscape was different. “At the time, Notion was just getting started. We saw people building new spreadsheets, new note-taking apps. And no one was applying those principles to CRM and that category,” he said. It’s going to be interesting to follow this space to see how it evolves. As for customers, they now have a ton of options when selecting their CRM platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, fintech API infrastructure players came into the African tech scene, ushering in Plaid-like services to businesses and developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the attention on these companies, particularly from venture capitalists, spiralled into this year, with each significant player raising large seed to Series A rounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://onepipe.com/">OnePipe</a>, a fintech API company with a different play from the lot, joins the list today, raising $3.5 million seed to double down on its embedded finance offering.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238935" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African impact-focused VC</span><a href="https://atlanticaventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlantica Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a co-lead investor in OnePipe’s <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/12/16/onepipe-raises-950k-pre-seed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$950,000 pre-seed</a> round last year, also co-led this seed round alongside</span><a href="https://tribecap.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribe Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and V&amp;R Associates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors Canaan Partners, Saison Capital, Norrsken (the fund of Klarna founder Niklas Adalberth), The Fund and Two Culture Cap also participated. Existing investors Chris Adelsbach, Techstars, Ingressive Capital, Acquity, P1, Raba and DFS Lab followed on with new checks, alongside a few angel investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are generally three main fintech API infrastructure plays. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is data and financial accounts aggregation (Plaid, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/nigerian-fintech-okra-raises-3-5m-backed-by-accenture-ventures-and-susa-ventures/">Okra</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/tiger-global-backs-african-fintech-mono-in-15m-series-a-round/">Mono</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/stitch-gets-a-2m-seed-extension-hires-benjamin-dada-to-lead-nigerian-expansion/">Stitch</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/african-fintech-pngme-raises-15m-for-its-financial-data-infrastructure-platform/">Pngme</a> are some players in the space)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second focuses on embedded finance and banking as a service, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/treasury-prime-series-b/">Treasury Prime</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/fintech-marqeta-expands-into-credit-card-space/">Marqeta</a> ply their trade. The third is core open banking pioneered by the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/truelayer-nabs-130m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-open-banking-rises-as-a-viable-option-to-card-networks/">TrueLayer</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnePipe’s original game plan was to create an API gateway that connected banks and fintechs under a uniform standard, a move that would allow the company to perform core open banking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But founder and C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/opeadeoye">Ope Adeoye</a> (self-described as the company’s chief plumber), on a call with TechCrunch, said upon continuous integration with these financial institutions, it became clear the company needed to pivot since it wasn’t generating many demand cycles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And having struck partnerships with a few banks, OnePipe decided to take a step back and delve into the world of embedded finance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike open banking and data aggregation plays where a company needs to collaborate with almost every bank in the country where they operate, it’s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the case with companies offering embedded finance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why OnePipe has six partner banks at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The caveat goes like this, the moment you make a positioning play for banking as a service, all you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need is one partner bank that lets you go deep because the embedded finance [offering] is about depth and not breadth,” said the CEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you go for data aggregation or open banking in general, then you are going for breadth, not depth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So on our side, we said we’d rather go with tier two and tier three bands, where once you describe the concept to them, they get it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It powers their growth and is more valuable to them, unlike other larger financial institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By running API infrastructure on behalf of these partner banks and helping them monetize it, OnePipe works with non-financial institutions to launch and cross-sell an array of financial services such as credit, accounts and payments within their offerings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We raised a round last year to focus on one use case of the partnership, which was to pull together the APIs of a fixed set of banks and offer embedded banking or banking as a service play,” Adeoye asserted. “Meaning, we make it possible for non-financial institutions, or businesses in general, to offer banking services to their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So an FMCG startup, for instance, can plug into a bank’s API managed by OnePipe and begin to issue accounts to customers, allowing them to make payments off those accounts and access credit when they need it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 10 months OnePipe switched up to this model, it has processed more than 6.3 million transactions worth over $46.3 million, the company said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These numbers are from over 1 million individual accounts and 138+ businesses, ranging from FMCG and retail to lending and agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnePipe takes a percentage cut from transactions made on these accounts and shares with its partner banks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For loans offered via its APIs, OnePipe takes at least 1% of the loan interest from its lending partners and also shares it with the businesses and partner banks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With what OnePipe has accomplished so far, Aniko Szigetvari, the founding partner at Atlantica Ventures, believes the company is not only deepening financial inclusion in Nigeria but the continent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In our view, embedded finance is the next enabler for both traditional and financial service businesses to increase customer loyalty and revenue by offering a wide range of third-party financial products and revenue streams for their customers,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though OnePipe is currently only present in Nigeria, it is making its first move beyond the country’s shores to align with Szigetvari’s statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnePipe is going through a strategic partnership route as Adeoye mentioned that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his company made a deal with African logistics and freight company Sendy to expand into other African countries. Per the company’s statement, the plan is to “pull a Stripe-Shopify-esque tag team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We made sure that before we looked into other African countries, we were going in with a customer on the ground already,” said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We did a deal with Sendy that made them participate in this round, and we will then deploy the capital for expansion. So as they go to Egypt, South Africa, we’ll </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be deploying with them and grow together.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The International Digital Economy Academy (<a href="https://idea.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEA</a>) quietly opened<a href="http://www.sznews.com/content/mb/2021-06/03/content_24269733.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> last year</a>, perched among ultramodern office buildings on Shenzhen&#8217;s side of the river border with Hong Kong.</p>
<p>While geographically separated from Hong Kong, technically, the research institute is located inside a special area straddling the two cities: the <a href="https://www.itc.gov.hk/en/doc/collaboration/joint_policy_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shenzhen-Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Cooperation Zone</a>. The name is self-explanatory. It&#8217;s a joint effort by the governments of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, with support from Beijing and favorable policies, to collaborate on scientific and technological research.</p>
<p>IDEA is one of the organizations that have set up inside the<a href="https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/video/photo/content/post_322531.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 3.89 km² special zone</a> &#8212; which is about the size of 540 football pitches &#8212; and is a brainchild of Harry Shum. The renowned computer scientist was an executive vice president at Microsoft from 2013 to 2019 and also co-founded Microsoft&#8217;s largest research branch outside the U.S., Microsoft Research Asia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like his former colleague at Microsoft, Kai-Fu Lee, Shum was active in both the research and business sides of AI. Now at IDEA, his team aims to &#8220;develop disruptive innovative technologies based on social needs and give back to society in a way that allows more people to benefit from the development of the digital economy.&#8221; Several research directors at IDEA are also Microsoft veterans, including Yutao Xie and Jiaping Wang.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">sweeping regulatory clampdown</a> on China&#8217;s internet firms has led to headlines saying Beijing has turned against tech. But the government&#8217;s intent is more nuanced. It&#8217;s zeroing in on Big Tech deemed harmful to the society and economy, companies that have encouraged financial market risks, gaming addiction, exploitation of gig workers, and other ills.</p>
<p>In the meantime, China remains fixated on its goal to promote fundamental research and reduce reliance on Western technologies. In Shenzhen, home to tech giants like Huawei, DJI and Tencent, the government is recruiting world-class scientists. Harry Shum and his team are among the latest to have joined the raft.</p>
<p>IDEA definitely has a buzzy name (and a great acronym). The term &#8220;digital economy&#8221; comes up often in President Xi Jinping&#8217;s speeches on how technology can be a driving force for the economy. The &#8220;digital economy has become a key force in restructuring the global economy and transforming the global competitive landscape in recent years,&#8221; the President <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202110/20/WS616f4e77a310cdd39bc6fedc.html">said</a> in October. &#8220;The internet, big data, cloud computing and other technologies are being increasingly integrated into all sectors of economic and social development.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>IDEA is examining how AI can transform industries like finance, manufacturing and medical care. This week, it announced it&#8217;s <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Zs2BD5KXuYoomkGIdQlGcw">partnering with leading Chinese quant trader</a> Ubiquant on a joint lab to work on &#8220;risk monitoring and avoidance for financial transaction markets,&#8221; as well as &#8220;basic infrastructure for high-performance computing systems.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kenya’s economy is powered by informal businesses, which contribute 33.8% to the country’s GDP and provide <a href="https://www.knbs.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Economic-Survey-2021.pdf">83.4%</a> of the total employment outside of small-scale agriculture, data from the country&#8217;s bureau of statistics shows. The contribution of these enterprises is pivotal to the country’s economy yet they remain underserved by traditional banking institutions making it hard for them to <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/262361468914023771/pdf/106986-WP-P151793-PUBLIC-Box.pdf">access the financing</a> needed to grow.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the financing gap left by conventional banking institutions has presented an opportunity for innovation, leading to the birth of fintechs like <a href="https://asilimia.co.ke/home">Asilimia</a>. The Kenyan startup has over the last three years been offering a lifeline to traders in Kenya by enabling them to make mobile money transactions that are devoid of transfer charges through its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asilimia-kenya-has-launched-leja-its-digital-app-manage-dogad-dogoui/?trk=public_profile_article_view">Leja app</a>.</p>
<p>And now, having secured $2 million in pre-seed funding ($1 million equity and $1 million debt), the startup is headed for its next phase of growth, which will involve extending loans to traders offering more relief to this subgroup that is often left out and regarded as high risk by the traditional banking sector.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238953" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding came from various investors including Fredrik Jung Abbou; a two-time unicorn founder and Norrsken Impact Accelerator, while the debt round had the participation of French Public Investment Bank (Bpifrance) and GreenTec Capital Partners.</p>
<p>Asilimia is set to use the funding to hire talent as it looks to fine tune its technology and to expand to another market within East Africa. It will also extend loans to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) based on data from its Leja app.</p>
<p>“We have entered a phase where we are exploring ways in which we can extend the much-needed credit enabling traders to buy equipment or products to sustain their enterprises,” Asilimia co-founder and CEO, Tekwane Mwendwa told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgane-kablan-957024120/?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAB3nQlMBAUGUT8-4BWi92LrqJQosM4Ndw80">Morgane Kablan</a>, is the startup’s other co-founder and chief operating officer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By providing mobile loans, Asilimia will join a space that has about 100 lending apps including Branch by San Francisco-based Branch International Ltd and PayPal-backed Tala.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239160" style="width: 6010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239160" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2239160 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg" alt="" width="6000" height="4000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239160" class="wp-caption-text">Asilimia team in Nairobi, Kenya.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Asilimia.</p></div></p>
<p>The Digital Lenders Association of Kenya told TechCrunch in a past interview that about 25 apps it represents disburse about $40 million a month. The apps offer collateral-free loans making them attractive to borrowers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/kenya-cracks-down-on-digital-lenders-over-data-privacy-issues/">looking for quick cash</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to enabling users to make mobile money transactions at no fee, Leja also supports bookkeeping, making it easier for the traders to track their revenues and outflows, without the need for technical or accounting knowledge. The platform provides valuable data that Asilimia plans to tap to extend loans to users.</p>
<p>Mwendwa said that Asilimia will create credit scoring models from the collected data to determine how much will be extended to borrowers.</p>
<p>“We will factor in their b2b transactions, cash flow, sales, liabilities and expenses because all this information is in the app. This is possible because traders love to use our app which, unlike other lending apps, has inventory management. I like to think of our app as the operating system of informal businesses and we are happy that it is a one-stop shop for the traders,” said Mwendwa.</p>
<p>“Another thing that traders struggle with is airtime top-up. We interact with them daily and understand their pain points, and so we want to give them all the support they need so that they can continue doing business &#8211; we will also extend airtime top up credit at no interest,” he said.</p>
<p>Tekwane said that a normal user makes about three transactions through the app every day and the business has been growing 30% week on week. About 27,000 users use its apps, with total transactions done through the Leja app reaching about $20 million.</p>
<p>Previously, the startup has been through the prestigious Station F incubation program in Paris and the Norrsken Impact Accelerator program. In 2019, the startup won the Africa Cup at the 2019 SA Innovation Summit, securing a $350,000 investment from Unicorn Group, a pan-African investment firm. It used the financing to fund its growth which included adding Leja to its portfolio.</p>
<p>Beyond East Africa, Asilimia is exploring growth opportunities in other regions, as it seeks to continue bridging the financing gap currently experienced by traders across the continent.</p>
<p>“MSMEs play a vital role across Africa and making it easier for them to succeed is great for the continent as a whole,” said Norrsken Impact Accelerator co-founder and managing director Funda Sezgi.</p>
<p>“Tekwane and the team have built a solution that works and we are delighted to be supporting them as they drive prosperity in a key sector for the African economy.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you&#8217;ve ever visited the site of the six-year-old, London-based direct-to-consumer clothing company Vollebak, you&#8217;ve likely marveled at the exaggerated descriptions of clothing it sells, including a jacket &#8220;designed for a world of megastorms, where &#8216;waterproof&#8217; is not enough,&#8221; a hoodie that promises to repel rain, wind, snow and fire; and and an &#8220;ice age&#8221; [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever visited the site of the six-year-old, London-based direct-to-consumer clothing company <a href="https://www.vollebak.com/">Vollebak</a>, you&#8217;ve likely marveled at the exaggerated descriptions of clothing it sells, including a jacket &#8220;designed for a world of megastorms, where &#8216;waterproof&#8217; is not enough,&#8221; a hoodie that promises to repel rain, wind, snow and fire; and and an &#8220;ice age&#8221; fleece &#8220;designed to recreate the feeling and performance of the soft hides worn by prehistoric man.&#8221;</p>
<p>That marketing genius comes directly from CEO Steve Tidball, who cofounded the outfit with his twin, Nick Tidball &#8212; both of whom worked in advertising previously and both of whom are active outdoorsmen, though their families and the growth of Vollebak have kept them closer to home in recent years. Indeed, Steve Tidball writes the copy himself, he revealed last week in an interview about Vollebak, a brand that prides itself on making &#8220;clothes for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>During that chat, he also answered our questions about how much tech is actually involved in the clothing&#8217;s production. And he let us know that Vollebak has so far raised around $10 million in outside funding, including through a Series A round that is about to close, led by the London-based venture firm <a href="https://www.venrex.partners/">Venrex</a>, with participation from Airbnb cofounder Joe Gebbia, and Headspace CFO Sean Brecker, among others. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You started this company with your twin, Nick. So much of its genius seems to be in how your clothing is marketed. Tell us a bit about how it came together.</strong></p>
<p>ST: We launched the company five years ago. Before that, we&#8217;d been working together in advertising for 15 years, so I think one of the reasons the marketing is more fun than it might otherwise be is that was our job.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve operated by an incredibly simple rule from a marketing perspective, which is basically: spend as little money as humanly possible. So, for instance, a couple years ago, we created our first piece of clothing for space, which was a deep sleep cocoon. And in marketing, you&#8217;re always [asking] who&#8217;s your audience, and really, our audience was one person here, which was Elon [Musk], so we found was a billboard [space] opposite SpaceX, and we just took out a poster there, and it said, &#8220;Our jackets are ready. How&#8217;s your rocket going?&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t cost much money, but it was really great fun, and NASA called the next week, and then we got [to] chatting to them.</p>
<p><strong>Your clothing is a reflection of the stuff that you think is going to happen to people over the next century, from space travel to sustainability.  You have a solar charge jacket that you say can glow like a firefly in the dark, for example. You have a &#8220;black squid&#8221; jacket that you say recreates one of nature&#8217;s most brilliant solutions to high visibility, the adaptive camouflage of the squid. How much tech is really involved here?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the last five years, the angle of tech we focused on is material science. That&#8217;s the one thing that, as a startup, we&#8217;ve had access to, because if you&#8217;re going to look at much [complex] technologies like AI or exoskeletons, you need a really huge amount of funding to go tackle those, whereas any startup can really go and look at material science. So that&#8217;s the angle we&#8217;re really fascinated with . ..[because]  that&#8217;s typically not been explored, how much material science could go into a product.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things we ever launched was the world&#8217;s first graphene jacket. Even the scientists who isolated graphene for the first time can&#8217;t actually tell you what graphene is going to do.  . . .[So] we said, well, one side has graphene and the other side doesn&#8217;t. Why don&#8217;t you go out and test it and tell us what it does? We had a theory that it could store and redistribute heat because graphene behaves in a very surprising way and there&#8217;s no limit to how much heat it can store. What came back were two particularly amazing stories, one of a U.S. doctor who&#8217;d been freezing at night in the Gobi Desert and who wrapped his graphene jacket around a camel, and after it absorbed the heat of the camel, he put his jacket back on and stayed warm through the night.</p>
<p>Another friend of ours, a Russian guy who was out in the Nepalese mountains and was in danger of freezing to death, used the graphene jacket to absorb the last rays of sun.It warmed up, and he put it on as his inner layer and credits it with keeping him warm through the night.</p>
<p><strong>How do you manufacture a graphene shirt or ceramic shirt? Do you have a special loom? Do you make it out of a 3d printer? What&#8217;s the process?</strong></p>
<p>You manufacture it with great difficulty is the answer, which is why our stuff costs more than regular clothing. What you really end up with is very specialist factories, typically in Europe, with really high tech machinery that very few people have access to.</p>
<p><strong>Do you typically do short production runs for your merchandise?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and at the start, that was really just a function of capital, meaning we didn&#8217;t have much, so we just made as many clothes as we could, they sold out really quickly, and we tried to make some more as the business has grown. There&#8217;s definitely stuff where it&#8217;s so complicated or so experimental, it would be reckless to make 10,000 of them. So yeah, we&#8217;ve made short runs of some of our most experimental stuff, just to see: does it work? Could it be improved?</p>
<p><strong>One of those experimental new products is the Mars jacket and pants. Where does one wear that?</strong></p>
<p>Of the funny things about making anything for Mars is that the irony, of course, that you have to test it on Earth. But the reality of going to Mars or any space travel is there&#8217;s going to be an exponential increase in the number of people going there and the number of jobs they need to do when they go there. You&#8217;re going to need scientists, biologists, builders, engineers, architects, they&#8217;re gonna have to wear something. And so the reality is, we want to start working on it early, so what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re starting to think about some of the tasks that need to be carried out, whether it&#8217;s on the moon or Mars or lower orbit stuff, and about: what are the jobs? What are some of the challenges that we&#8217;re going to face? This is why the jacket comes with a vomit pocket, because your vestibular system is thrown into disarray as soon as you encounter a lack of gravity.</p>
<p><strong>How do you know about the vestibular system? You&#8217;re a marketing genius. Are you also a scientist?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a pretend scientist [laughs]. But we have a lot of really interesting people around us, whether it&#8217;s people who think about the future of warfare, or people who think about the future of space travel, we often joke that our business is run on WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you receive most of that feedback? C</strong><strong>ertain D2C brands that are very active on social and Instagram and have Slack channels. How do things work over there?</strong></p>
<p>I had this really early thought that if you could combine really cool innovative technology with really friendly people on the end of email, that could be a really cool thing.</p>
<p><strong>You only sell directly through the Vollebak site. Will that ever change?</strong></p>
<p>Not in the near term future, one of the things that&#8217;s been absolutely central to the brand is getting that feedback, andI really worry about losing that connection to the customers. Let&#8217;s say someone has a cool experience with one of our shirts or one of our jackets, and they bought it at some wholesale store, and they have no real connection to us. I feel that&#8217;s lost information.</p>
<p>We will be doing more stuff in the metaverse space very, very soon, because I just find it so exciting, the idea that there&#8217;s going to be this competition or integration between the virtual world and real world. So we&#8217;re currently building some fairly crazy stuff in that space. We&#8217;re currently on the hunt for some supercomputers powerful enough to process some of the stuff we&#8217;re working on. But yet basically, anything that we think is going to define the future, we&#8217;ll plow pretty heavily into.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blume Ventures said on Wednesday it has raised $105 million in the first close of its fourth fund, less than two years after finalizing its previous fund, as investment activity intensifies in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old firm, one of the largest Indian venture funds, said it expects its new fund to balloon to close to $200 million by March next year, which is when it hopes for the final close. Its current LPs include some multi-family office wealth management funds, sovereigns, and some corporates across Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>With the new fund, the investment firm will continue to focus on backing early stage startups in their pre-seed and pre-Series A rounds, said Karthik Reddy, co-founder and managing partner at Blume Ventures, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239116" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://blume.vc">Blume Ventures</a> &#8212; which counts online learning platform Unacademy, fintech Slice, hyperlocal delivery service Dunzo, edtech Classplus, used-car marketplace Spinny, and insurer Turtlemint among its portfolio startups &#8212; backs early stage startups and typically writes its starting check in the range of $1 million to $2.5 million.</p>
<p>Over the years, Blume Ventures has become one of the most respected venture firms in the country. Even the startups that don’t end up getting a check from the fund speak highly of its partners, according to many entrepreneurs with whom TechCrunch has spoken.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s announcement comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record amounts of capital. Sequoia Capital India, Tiger Global, Falcon Edge Capital, and SoftBank have increased the pace of their investments in India in recent quarters as they double down on finding winners in one of the last great growth markets.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also seen many firms aggressively scramble for new strategies. But Blume Ventures appears to follow the more conservative approach. The venture firm has written about 25 checks from its previous fund and still has some reserves to do follow-on rounds, said Reddy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the height of the pandemic, Blume Ventures was “slow and thoughtful” as it was not very comfortable with assessing firms over Zoom calls, he said. “We took our own time to write the last few checks,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are getting amazing love from large investors,” he said, adding that it may appear that some of the startups larger firms have backed in recent quarters have seen multi-fold jumps in valuations, but he pointed to some business-to-business e-commerce marketplaces and noted that their growth build-up had been in the works for three to four years.</p>
<p>With the firm’s $102 million third fund, Blume Ventures backed a number of firms in edtech and deep-tech SaaS spaces, he said. Reddy said it was too early to say how the third fund has performed, but added that it has probably never seen its portfolio firms reach the $50 million to $100 million valuations stage faster.</p>
<p>“But that’s natural. If you have a good founder, good story to tell, you don’t need a boat load of revenue to go and raise a double-digit round today,” he said, adding that by March the firm expects valuation of 10 portfolio startups from the third fund to be over $75 million. “This is a first-time experience for us. It took us much longer in previous funds.”</p>
<p>With the new fund, the largest for Blume Ventures, the firm expects to participate for longer in the lifecycle of its portfolio startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Samsung Electronics announced today it has selected a site in Taylor, Texas, to build a new semiconductor wafer fabrication plant that is set to produce advanced logic devices. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The estimated $17 billion investment, which will mark the largest investment made by Samsung in the U.S., is expected to create about 2,000 new jobs directly and thousands of related jobs once the new facility is in full operation. The funding will bring Samsung’s total investment in the U.S. to more than $47 billion since beginning U.S. operations in 1978. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Taylor site, about 16 miles from Samsung’s current manufacturing site in Austin, is expected to serve as a key location for Samsung’s global semiconductor manufacturing capacity along, with its latest new production line in Pyeongtaek, South Korea. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239083" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new facility will manufacture products based on advanced process technologies such as mobile, 5G, high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Samsung’s decision comes amid a global chip shortage that has undermined industries from </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">automobiles to electronics.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company said it remains committed to supporting customers globally by making advanced semiconductor fabrication more accessible and meeting surging demand for semiconductor products.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Samsung will start construction on the Taylor site, which will span more than 5 million square meters, in the first quarter of 2022, aiming to have production up and running in the second half of 2024.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“As we add a new facility in Taylor, Samsung is laying the groundwork for another important chapter in our future,” said Kinam Kim, vice chairman and CEO of device solution division at Samsung Electronics. “With greater manufacturing capacity, we will able to better serve the needs of our customers and contribute to the stability of the global semiconductor supply chain. We are also proud to be bringing more jobs and supporting the training and talent development for local communities, as Samsung celebrates 25 years of semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After reviewing multiple locations within the U.S. for a potential manufacturing plant, the decision to invest in Taylor was based on multiple factors, including the local semiconductor ecosystem, infrastructure stability, local government support and community development opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Based on media reports, Samsung, which evaluated other locations such as Arizona, New York and South Korea for the new chip plant, picked Texas’ Williamson County because it offered a better tax policy. In July, Samsung Electronics applied for a tax break (from the Taylor Independent School District) to build a chipmaking factory in Taylor, Texas, according to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://assets.comptroller.texas.gov/ch313/1620/1620-taylor-samsung-app.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a file</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> submitted with Texas authorities in July. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“It [Samsung] seeks a strong public partner to support the project through financial and other incentives (e.g., infrastructure and utility assistance). In connection with the project, the company is seeking rebates under Chapter 380 and 381 assistance from the Texas Enterprise Fund. In addition, the company is also pursuing incentives relating to certain infrastructure and utility improvements, rate reductions, and other non-cash benefits to support construction and operations of the proposed project,” as per the document. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Samsung will also contribute financial support to create a Samsung Skills Center for the Taylor Independent School District (ISD) to help students develop future career skills and provide internships and recruiting opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Companies like Samsung continue to invest in Texas because of our world-class business climate and exceptional workforce,” said Governor Wayne Abbott. “Samsung’s new semiconductor manufacturing facility in Taylor will bring countless opportunities for hardworking Central Texans and their families and will play a major role in our state’s continued exceptionalism in the semiconductor industry.”</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Samsung Group’s de facto leader Jay Y. Lee, visiting North America last week, met with the U.S. government officials in Washington, D.C. to discuss the second chip plant and semiconductor supply chain. Lee also met with other tech firm leaders, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and execs at Moderna and Verizon Wireless, to strengthen their business ties. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Intel recently broke ground on two new chipmaking plants in Arizona. At the same time, TSMC started constructing a $12 billion chip factory in Arizona and announced its plan to build the first chip plant in Japan in October. Texas Instruments also unveiled its investment plan for four new semiconductor fabrication plants in Sherman, Texas. </span></p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It’s not just your imagination — usage-based pricing (UBP) is seemingly everywhere in 2021.</p>
<p>SaaS companies have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">ditching traditional subscription pricing</a> in favor of usage-based models that better align with modern buying behavior and the value delivered by their products. UBP, also known as consumption-based pricing, connects how much a customer pays with how much they consume a given product or service.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Usage-based subscriptions can be a way for SaaS companies to test the feasibility of UBP without needing to completely change their business model.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Public cloud observability company New Relic introduced its consumption-based pricing model in July 2020. More recently the company doubled down on the model, deciding to only pay sales reps based on customers’ actual consumption rather than subscription commitments. The decision appears to be paying off, as New Relic has seen a spurt in both account growth and data retention, two leading indicators the company tracks closely.</p>
<p>Similar pricing pivots have been made by startups like Cypress, which introduced consumption-based pricing in March 2021; pre-IPO companies like Kong, which announced a pay-as-you-go pricing tier in May 2021; and even longstanding companies like 40-year-old Autodesk, which introduced pay-as-you-go pricing in September.</p>
<p>According to our <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/2021-state-of-usage-based-pricing/">State of Usage-Based Pricing Report</a>, which includes data from nearly 600 participants, 45% of SaaS companies had a UBP model in 2021. This figure is up significantly compared to 34% in 2020 and 30% in 2019.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238034" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238034" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2238034" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-State-of-Usage-Based-Pricing-1-1.png" alt="Graph depicting rise of usage-based pricing adoption 2018-2023" width="1024" height="530" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-State-of-Usage-Based-Pricing-1-1.png 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-State-of-Usage-Based-Pricing-1-1.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-State-of-Usage-Based-Pricing-1-1.png?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-State-of-Usage-Based-Pricing-1-1.png?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-State-of-Usage-Based-Pricing-1-1.png?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-State-of-Usage-Based-Pricing-1-1.png?resize=1536,795 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-State-of-Usage-Based-Pricing-1-1.png?resize=2048,1060 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-State-of-Usage-Based-Pricing-1-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238034" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>OpenView Partners</p></div></p>
<h2>The wave won&#8217;t slow down in 2022</h2>
<p>A quarter of companies that currently use a UBP model say they introduced it within the last 12 months. This year’s adoption of UBP exceeds that of both 2019 and 2020 combined.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a majority of the UBP holdouts (61%) say they expect to either launch or test usage-based pricing in the near future. If these trends continue, UBP will become the norm, not the exception, as early as 2022.</p>
<h2>Subscriptions versus UBP isn’t an either-or decision</h2>
<p>The data shows that UBP can — and often does — co-exist with traditional subscription pricing. Those with a usage-based model are divided equally between those who offer usage-based subscription tiers (23%) and those with a largely usage-based or pay-as-you-go pricing model (23%).</p>

The deal surely brought a smile to the faces of Auth0&#8217;s investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-auth0-and-ubiquity?utm_source=tc%20post&amp;utm_campaign=tc%20post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On December 1 at 12p PT / 3p ET</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Auth0 co-founder Eugenio Pace and investor Sunil Nagaraj of Ubiquity to learn for certain.</p>

<p>Eugenio Pace spent more than a decade at Microsoft before starting his journey with Auth0. Nagaraj, for his part, is founding partner at Ubiquity Ventures, which is a seed-stage firm with close to $100 million in AUM.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/"><strong>Apple sues NSO:</strong></a> If you read international political news, you’ve likely heard of NSO Group. Its hacking tools have been used by governments to spy on dissidents and journalists alike. It turns out Apple has had it with the group’s “nation-state spyware Pegasus,” as TechCrunch put it. So Apple is suing NSO Group, calling the company “immoral 21st century mercenaries who have created highly sophisticated cyber-surveillance machinery that invites routine and flagrant abuse.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/india-plans-law-that-will-prohibit-all-private-cryptocurrencies-with-certain-exceptions/">India looks to ban crypto:</a></strong> A plan to “introduce, evaluate and enforce a bill to prohibit ‘all private cryptocurrencies’ in the country” is set to come with the winter legislative session in India. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/nigeria-follows-chinas-footsteps-in-piloting-digital-currency/">wouldn’t be the first country</a> to look to supplant private-market blockchain tech with plans for a national digital coin. China is another such country. The bill may include exceptions, but it’s not a promising trend for India’s crypto sector.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/10b-is-the-new-1b-and-we-need-a-new-framework-for-startup-valuations/">Forget unicorns; we need new terms:</a></strong> Remember when startup unicorns were rare and reaching a $1 billion valuation was big news? It was some time ago. Now with more than 900 unicorns around the world, the term has lost meaning. What should we replace it with?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/dent-reality-raises-3-4m-to-bring-augmented-reality-into-the-grocery-store/"><strong>AR tomatoes:</strong></a><strong> </strong>London-based Dent Reality wants to bring augmented reality, or AR, to the grocery store. Sure, there’s a lot of chatter these days concerning the metaverse thanks to Facebook’s parent company, but smaller, more targeted AR products could have a place in our collective futures. The startup just raised $3.4 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/uk-based-mental-health-provider-ieso-raises-53m-armed-with-an-unprecedented-dataset/"><strong>Your AI therapist will see you now:</strong></a> The U.K.-based startup ieso has raised a huge $53 million Series B for its work to bring cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to its country’s National Health Service (NHS). Per the company’s website, it is “integrating AI and automation” into the therapy market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/verbit-lands-250m-series-e-at-a-2b-valuation-to-double-down-on-its-acquisition-strategy/"><strong>Verbit raises (again) for AI transcription software:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Transcribing words from audio is big business. Lots of folks get paid to do it by hand. There are startups like Otter also competing in the space. But Verbit surely has more money than its competitors, having just closed a $250 million Series E at a $2 billion valuation less than half a year after its last raise. The company blends software and humans in its approach.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/peek-raises-80m-as-its-travel-experiences-software-and-marketplace-business-passes-2b-in-bookings/"><strong>Peek shows that Doing Things is making a comeback:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If Airbnb lets you rent houses, Peek lets you — or your company — rent experiences. And the company just landed an $80 million round at a $2 billion valuation. We presume that the investment means that folks are once again out and about, despite COVID’s remaining risks.</li>
<li><strong>Today’s news from BNPL Land:</strong> The buy now, pay later (BNPL) boom continues this week, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/lee-fixels-addition-leads-32m-investment-into-truepay-a-brazilian-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-startup/">TruePay raising $23 million for its Brazilian solution</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/klarna-offers-pay-now-option-in-u-s-klarna-card-coming-soon/">sector giant Klarna launching a “buy now” option</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/column-tax-announces-5-1m-seed-round-to-launch-mobile-tax-prep-products/"><strong>Column Tax preps for tax season with new round:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Filing taxes in the United States is about as much fun as fixing a car in the dark, by yourself, without tools. It’s a mess, thanks in part <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free">to Intuit deliberately spending money</a> to ensure it can keep collecting tax prep rents. Regardless, Column is focusing on the younger market, integrating with tech that folks already use, and it expects to have its tax prep service out in time for the U.S. tax season.</li>
<li>And because it is that time of year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/gift-guide-the-best-tech-gifts-for-plant-geeks/">here’s a TechCrunch gift guide with a chlorophyll twist</a>.</li>

<p>Swedish autonomous freight company Einride recently raised $110 million to fund its expansion into the United States. In partnership with stateside brands like Oatly and GE Appliances, the company will operate self-driving trucks and autonomous EV pods that connect to Saga, its proprietary IoT system.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/einride-founder-robert-falck-on-his-moral-obligation-to-electrify-autonomous-trucking/">Founder and CEO Robert Falck spoke to TechCrunch</a> about why he thinks climate tech solutions are more likely to come from startups and why he doesn&#8217;t believe in Level 5 autonomy, where a vehicle can perform every driving task under any conditions.</p>
<blockquote><p>No human driver can reach Level 5. I mean, consider this: If it’s a blizzard, do you drive as fast as you would on a sunny summer afternoon? No, of course not. So that’s the thinking we applied.</p></blockquote>

Well, the two had plans, it appears. The music service has teamed up with DistroKid to offer “a direct artist payments system.” TechCrunch put the new work under the larger rubric of Tidal “experimenting with streaming payout models that are thought to distribute funds more equitably to musicians who don’t get millions of streams on any given day.”</li>

NASA wants to give you a nudge. And it’s launching the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, mission to do so. Jokes aside, having the ability to steer rocks from Earth’s path is a good idea, provided that you aren’t in favor of concluding our global experiment with highly evolved primates.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/rocket-lab-aims-to-catch-electron-rocket-booster-mid-air-with-a-helicopter-next-year/">Forget drone ships, how about helicopter retrieval?</a> </strong>Want to catch a rocket booster? You can do it in a few ways. SpaceX has little flat boats for the work. Rocket Lab wants to snag its Electron rockets out of the air with helicopters. Either way, the approaches are better than the old method of letting boosters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_cemetery">just kersplat into the ocean</a>.</li>
<li>If you are into the enterprise side of things, our own Ron Miller <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/with-his-first-reinvent-looming-what-will-awss-new-boss-bring-to-the-table/">has a good blog up</a></strong> about what he’s expecting — hoping? — to hear from the new AWS boss next week.</li>

News is out that the U.S. video company is launching “a reboot of Gameloft’s Asphalt Xtreme, which officially shut down this September.” That’s kinda cool? It’s hardly AAA fare, but all the same, Netflix has to do <em>something</em> different to stand out.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In August 2020, two FBI agents were standing on my doorstep, unannounced, wanting to ask me questions about a TechCrunch story we had published the year before.</p>
<p>The story was about how a hacker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/19/mexican-embassy-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took thousands of documents</a>, including visas and diplomatic passports, from a server at Mexico&#8217;s Embassy in Guatemala. The hacker said they had contacted Mexican officials about the vulnerable server but were ignored, and so the hacker tweeted out a link to the embassy&#8217;s files. &#8220;When I don’t get a reply, then it’s going public,&#8221; the hacker told me.</p>
<p>I contacted Mexico&#8217;s consulate in New York for comment, as is standard practice when reporting a story. A spokesperson said the Mexican government took the matter &#8220;very seriously.&#8221; We published our story, and that seemed to be the end of it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238967" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FBI knock at my door a year later suggested it wasn&#8217;t. I declined to speak with the agents and closed the door.</p>
<p>After we published our story the Mexican government requested the help of the U.S. Department of Justice through diplomatic channels to investigate the hack and presumably try to identify the hacker. Because I had contact with the hacker, that must have made me a subject of interest to the Mexican authorities, hence the visit a year on.</p>
<p>A month after the house call, the Mexican government provided the FBI with a list of written questions it wanted us to answer, many of which were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/19/mexican-embassy-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already answered in the story</a>. Our response to the DOJ declined to provide anything more than what we had already published.</p>
<p>Legal demands against reporters are not uncommon; some even see it as an occupational hazard of working in the media. Demands often come in the form of a threat, almost always compelling the journalist or news outlet to retract a story, or sometimes even to stop a story before it&#8217;s published. Journalists covering cybersecurity — a beat rarely known for its chipper and upbeat headlines — are especially prone to legal threats by companies or governments wanting to avoid embarrassing headlines about their poor security practices.</p>
<p>Take the recent public standoff between Missouri Governor Mike Parson and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper, which the governor accused of illegal hacking after one of its journalists <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/missouri-teachers-social-security-numbers-at-risk-on-state-agency-s-website/article_f3339700-ece0-54a1-9a45-f300321b7c82.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found thousands of Social Security numbers</a> on the state education department&#8217;s website. The journalist verified this with three people whose Social Security numbers were exposed, promptly informed the state of the security lapse and held the story until the data could be taken down.</p>
<p>Parson said the reporting violated the state&#8217;s hacking laws and ordered law enforcement and a county prosecutor to investigate the paper, claiming the reporting was &#8220;an attempt to embarrass the state.&#8221; Legal experts, <a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1448733737856888840" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawmakers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/f12-isnt-hacking-missouri-governor-threatens-to-prosecute-local-journalist-for-finding-exposed-state-data/">even members of Parson&#8217;s own party</a> derided the governor for his rebuke of the newspaper, which was found to have acted <a href="https://statescoop.com/missouri-parson-reporter-did-nothing-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entirely ethically</a>. Parson <a href="https://gizmodo.com/missouri-governor-ramps-up-attack-on-newspaper-over-hac-1847920825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubled down</a> in a video paid for by his political action committee, which contained several false claims and called the newspaper &#8220;fake news.&#8221; Earlier this month, the department <a href="https://dese.mo.gov/communications/news-releases/State%20of%20Missouri%20Offers%20Credit%20and%20Identity%20Theft%20Monitoring%20to%20Educators%20after%20Data%20Vulnerability%20Incident" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apologized</a> for the lapse that ultimately affected more than 620,000 state educators.</p>
<p>Claiming illegality or impropriety is a tactic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/talkspace-cease-desist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used more broadly</a> against security researchers, who find and disclose exposed personal information and security flaws before malicious hackers can exploit them. Security researchers, much like independent journalists, often work alone and have no choice but to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/what3words-legal-threat-whatfreewords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiesce to legal threats</a>, fearing high legal costs of taking a case to court, even if their work is entirely legal and helped to prevent a potentially worse security incident down the line. Not all of them have an experienced and willing media legal team to back their play.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve rebuffed spurious legal demands before, but having federal agents on your doorstep simply for doing your job is certainly a new one for me. There has been no suggestion of wrongdoing, though it&#8217;s unsettling not knowing what view Mexico would take if I ever stepped foot on its soil.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the legal threats and demands that don&#8217;t make it to print that can have the most damage. Legal demands inherently have a silencing effect. Sometimes they succeed. Journalism can be risky and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/01/the-dinner-that-destroyed-gawker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the newsrooms don&#8217;t always win</a>. Left unchecked, legal threats can have a chilling effect that stifles both security research and journalism by making it legally toxic to work. That means the world is less informed and sometimes less secure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arc is not even a year old and the electric boat startup has attracted investment from top VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, entertainment industry big wigs and now a $30 million raise led by an early Tesla executive who led the automaker&#8217;s early manufacturing efforts.</p>
<p>The $30 million Series A was led by Greg Reichow, the former Tesla executive who is now a partner at Eclipse Ventures. Existing investors &#8212; Andreessen Horowitz, Chris Sacca&#8217;s Lowercarbon Capital and Ramtin Naimi&#8217;s Abstract Ventures also joined. Reichow will also join Arc&#8217;s board, the startup said in its Tuesday announcement. To date, Arc has raised $37 million, including earlier investment from the funds of Will Smith&#8217;s Dreamers VC, Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman&#8217;s Thirty Five Ventures and Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs&#8217; Combs Enterprises.</p>
<p>The influx of capital and heavy hitting backers for the young company reflects broadening interest in electrification beyond a vehicle with two or four wheels — a sector that has been flooded with multimillion-dollar private funding raises as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/electric-automaker-rivian-largest-ipo-2021/">eye-popping debuts on public exchanges.</a> (Earlier this week, GM announced it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/gm-acquires-25-stake-in-electric-boat-company-pure-watercraft/">taken a 25% stake</a> in electric boat company Pure Watercraft.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238956" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also, of course, a validation of Arc&#8217;s particular business, which is to electrify everything on the water, starting with a limited-edition $300,000 boat.</p>
<p>Mitch Lee, who is CEO, and former SpaceX engineer Ryan Cook co-founded Arc with a plan to develop and sell electric watercraft at various price points and use cases. They started by focusing on the design and development of a purpose-built hull and purpose-built battery packs. Its first boat is the Arc One, a 24-foot aluminum boat that produces 475 horsepower and can run between 3 to 5 hours on a single charge. Arc will produce fewer than 25 Arc One boats.</p>
<p>Arc has plans that expand beyond building and selling a couple of dozen high-priced boats. But at least in the near term, Arc is focused on delivering the Arc One, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the biggest mysteries in former Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes&#8217; high-profile fraud trial was whether or not she would testify. So it was a shock late Friday afternoon when the Stanford dropout took the stand, 11 weeks after the trial began. Now that the prosecution has rested its case &#8212; questioning witnesses like former U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, whistleblower Erika Cheung, Theranos patients, investors, medical professionals and journalists &#8212; Holmes is telling her side of the story under oath, her defense aiming to build the case that she did not knowingly defraud her investors.</p>
<p>The former Silicon Valley hotshot faces two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. If convicted, each count could land her up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>So far, Holmes has stuck to her argument that while Theranos made errors, the startup&#8217;s failure wasn&#8217;t fraud. She claims that when she told stakeholders about the capabilities of Theranos&#8217; technology, she was conveying what she thought was the truth. Since Holmes isn&#8217;t a trained scientist, she says she listened to the guidance of the experts she hired &#8212; she even testified that scientists and engineers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/11/23/technology/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos?name=styln-elizabeth-holmes-trial&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=LegacyCollection&amp;variant=show&amp;is_new=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designed a slide deck</a> presented to investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Holmes&#8217; defense has produced emails from high-ranking lab officials like chief scientist Ian Gibbons, who <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1463195853049319424" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said that</a> Theranos machines had &#8220;demonstrated capabilities fully equivalent to lab methods in areas where we have done assay development.&#8221; Holmes testified that Gibbons&#8217; emails indicated that Theranos&#8217; 4.0 Edison machine &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1463193993047465984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could run any test</a>,&#8221; per live courtroom reporting from Law 360&#8217;s Dorothy Atkins (the trial is not livestreamed). Gibbons died by suicide in 2013 while employed at Theranos, days before he was to be summoned to appear in court about a Theranos-related patent dispute.</p>
<p>Holmes has also denied that she was trying to lead Walgreens astray by sending the company documents with the unauthorized use of Pfizer&#8217;s logo. She said in court that she wishes <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1463204231964336128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she had handled the situation differently</a>, but that she had included the Pfizer logo because Theranos had done some testing with Pfizer before they decided not to work together. Her defense also pulled up a study from Johns Hopkins University from around the same time, which called the Theranos technology &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1463205972399181827" target="_blank" rel="noopener">novel and sound</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a direct response to a key claim from the prosecution, which produced evidence that Holmes sent Walgreens a document in 2010 called “Pfizer Theranos System Validation Final Report.&#8221; As it turned out, this document was<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/to-hook-walgreens-holmes-gave-execs-fake-pharma-reports-prosecution-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> created by Theranos staff</a>, not Pfizer. Yet Pfizer&#8217;s logo appeared prominently in the document, which indicated that the pharmaceutical giant endorsed Theranos&#8217; technology. Theranos entered into deals with Walgreens and Safeway that year. But in court, a Pfizer scientist <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/uh-no-pfizer-scientist-denies-holmes-claim-that-pfizer-endorsed-theranos-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied</a> that Pfizer endorsed Theranos, adding that no employees approved the document she sent while in talks about the deal. Pfizer had looked into Theranos&#8217; technology in 2008, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/uh-no-pfizer-scientist-denies-holmes-claim-that-pfizer-endorsed-theranos-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose not to invest</a> in the company.</p>
<p>Holmes has also begun discussing her relationship with the Theranos board, who were paid $150,000 per year and given half a million shares for their role &#8212; former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was paid $500,000 per year as a consultant. So far, it seems Holmes is trying to characterize the board as being knowledgeable enough about the nature of the company to make an informed investment in the company. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/11/23/technology/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos?name=styln-elizabeth-holmes-trial&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=LegacyCollection&amp;variant=show&amp;is_new=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1463208425857290246?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courtroom reporters</a> have noted that Holmes is deploying corporate and scientific jargon in her testimony.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Elizabeth Holmes built Theranos with a heartfelt pitch that raised enough capital from high-profile investors to reach a $10 billion valuation. With just a needle prick of blood, her technology would run dozens of blood tests to detect disease quicker, and at a lower cost. She <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/i-get-it-elizabeth-holmes/">famously repeated</a> the line: “I hope that less people will have to say goodbye too soon to people that they love.”</p>
<p>But, as we now know &#8212; and as you can now learn about through tell-all <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/theranos-the-inventor-review/">HBO documentaries</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/16/in-bad-blood-a-pedestrian-tale-of-heuristics-and-lies/">investigative nonfiction books</a> &#8212; the technology didn&#8217;t work, and the company appeared to continue testing patients&#8217; blood despite knowing they couldn&#8217;t deliver accurate medical information. Her criminal trial began in early September in San Jose, California &#8212; after delays due to the pandemic and Holmes&#8217; childbirth &#8212; with Judge Edward Davila at the bench.</p>
<p>In her heyday, when Forbes named her the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2015/05/27/forbes-announces-inaugural-list-of-americas-50-richest-self-made-women/?sh=4ab0aca824c1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youngest and wealthiest</a> female self-made billionaire in America, she was portrayed as a Steve Jobs-like genius with unstoppable charisma. But in court filings, Holmes&#8217; defense said that Ramesh &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Balwani, her former boyfriend and COO of Theranos, was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-holmess-office-romance-now-on-display-in-court-11633440600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abusive and controlling</a>. The filings indicate that Holmes&#8217; lawyers might introduce testimony on Holmes&#8217; mental health and the effects of the abuse as part of her defense, perhaps pinning the blame of Theranos&#8217; failure on Balwani, who will be tried for fraud separately next year.</p>
<p>But as Holmes has testified the last few days, the San Jose courthouse has looked more like a circus than the site of a criminal fraud case. Law360 reporter Dorothy Atkins tweeted this morning that when she arrived at 4:30 AM, she was the <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1463124934184476675" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32nd person in line</a> to enter the courthouse. Due to the popularity of the case, audience members have <a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/judges/davila-edward-j-ejd/usa-v-holmes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been urged</a> to only take notes or live-report using silent keyboards, like touch screens on a smartphone. Some journalists have <a href="https://twitter.com/eringriffith/status/1462782002327814148" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brought tarot cards</a> to give readings while waiting hours in line. The fanfare is reminiscent of the early days of the trial in September, when fans (yes, fans) of the disgraced entrepreneur <a href="https://uproxx.com/viral/elizabeth-holmes-cosplayers-reactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cosplayed as Elizabeth Holmes</a>. As a play on that viral moment, artist<a href="https://daniellebaskin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Danielle Baskin</a> &#8212; who often <a href="https://vctradingcards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pokes fun</a> at Silicon Valley culture &#8212; sold blonde wigs, black turtlenecks, lipstick and blood energy drinks in line this morning (she later tweeted that she learned today that you can&#8217;t &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/djbaskin/status/1463217331962736644" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell merch</a>&#8221; on federal property.)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Though Elizabeth Holmes makes for an easy Halloween costume, the <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1463183206115684360" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antics</a> around the high-profile case can&#8217;t undermine the horrifying evidence presented by the prosecution, which is working to prove to the jury that Holmes knowingly defrauded investors by lying about the efficacy of Theranos products.</p>
<p>One former Theranos patient, Erin Tompkins, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-elizabeth-holmes-trial-patients-describe-alarming-test-results-11637272480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified in court</a> that her Theranos test results detected the presence of HIV antibodies, which could mean she had the virus that causes AIDS, a life-threatening disease. Tompkins said she didn&#8217;t have insurance at the time, so it wasn&#8217;t until three months later that she could get a blood test elsewhere, which did not detect HIV. She said she was initially drawn to Theranos since the prices were so low. Another patient, Dr. Mehrl Ellsworth, testified that he received inaccurate results, which falsely indicated that he had prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Dr. Adam Rosendorff, the former Theranos lab director, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/business/elizabeth-holmes-trial-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified that</a> &#8220;the company was more about PR and fundraising than patient care,&#8221; adding that Holmes went ahead with Theranos&#8217; commercial launch despite his concerns about the technology. One of the Theranos whistleblowers, Erika Cheung, recounted her story of quitting the startup because she was uncomfortable processing patient samples when she didn&#8217;t think the technology could provide accurate results.</p>
<p>After court adjourns today, the trial will take a break for the Thanksgiving holiday, resuming Holmes&#8217; testimony on Monday. According to <a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/cases-of-interest/usa-v-holmes-et-al/US-v-Holmes-18-cr-00258-EJD-Updated-Trial-Schedule-10-27-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court schedules</a>, her defense is expected to continue presenting its case through the middle of December.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startup culture is informal, which is why some workers end up with job titles like &#8220;customer delight manager&#8221; or &#8220;product whisperer.&#8221;</p>
<p>That might work inside mature companies, but early-stage founders who are presenting themselves to investors must be more specific.</p>
<p>In an interview with Natasha Mascarenhas, B2B stealth startup founder Akshaya Dinesh recounted the time her team was rejected by an accelerator because they hadn&#8217;t yet picked a CEO.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238828" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“We said something like, ‘We’re very early and we’re both technical so we’re kind of doing everything together,’ but if we had to choose it would be X,&#8221; said Dinesh.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/name-your-job-title-before-you-name-your-startup/">Making sure each contributor has a clearly defined title</a> gives potential investors a better understanding of the team and its abilities — and it will also help avoid future legal disputes.</p>
<p>But like it or not, it also means some founders will receive a larger slice of the pie than others.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we’ve learned through loud legal disputes and quieter signs, titles matter,&#8221; writes Natasha, who also interviewed several investors and legal experts. &#8220;Perhaps even more than the name of your startup does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he became a partner at Battery Ventures, Bill Binch was chief revenue officer at Pendo, a product analytics app.</p>
<p>In his former role, he was responsible for providing his company’s board with quarterly updates on growth and revenue.</p>
<p>“As a wise mentor once told me, no one ever gets a promotion from a board meeting, but people sure do get fired afterward,” he writes in an article about the five slides sales and revenue teams must get right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headline reel.</li>
<li>Detailed, five-quarter view.</li>
<li>Segments, geographies and verticals.</li>
<li>Pipeline.</li>
<li>Sales team health.</li>

<p>Bringing a CFO aboard is not a high priority at most early-stage startups.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t a critical role until the company reaches product-market fit, and the best ones are expensive to recruit and retain.</p>
<p>Hiring a part-time CFO may be a better option, particularly for companies that are shaping up their finances before seeking new funding, advises Ranga Bodla, head of industry marketing for Oracle NetSuite.</p>
<p>&#8220;With no sign that the flow of capital will ease in the near future, bringing in a fractional CFO could be a well-timed strategic move for startups with ambitious growth plans,&#8221; he writes.</p>

<p>In India, nearly every store has a placard with a Paytm QR code customers can use to pay for nearly anything.</p>
<p>Given its ubiquity, there was boundless optimism ahead of the fintech’s IPO last week. However, the stock tanked the next day and fell further this week.</p>
<p>It appears the public didn’t like the IPO price too much, Alex Wilhelm writes. Despite a growing merchant base and strong rise in GMV, it appears Paytm “is struggling to pull enough revenue from its work to cover the cost of doing business.”</p>

<p>Interchange fees can be costly for e-commerce retailers in more than one way — costly payment methods like credit cards lead to customers making fewer transactions and abandoning shopping carts.</p>
<p>And Amazon’s recent decision to stop accepting Visa cards on its U.K. site is evidence of just how much those costs can matter, writes Ryan Lawler.</p>
<p>A host of e-commerce platforms are increasingly moving to alternatives like buy now, pay later as customers tend to buy more often when given no-interest or interest-free payment alternatives, and providers like Affirm and Afterpay are poised to reap the benefits of this shift, Ryan writes.</p>
<p>“We’re likely to see more BNPL partnerships and adoption as retailers seek to grow their top-line sales, reach new customers and move beyond credit cards as a primary payment method.”</p>

<p>Founders are often told to perfect one product and only shift focus after they’ve either succeeded or failed at it.</p>
<p>But Confluent simultaneously built a cloud product while still figuring out its on-premise service business, writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenge for us was that we had a software offering with very large customers with lots of demands, and we had to [build] a cloud offering across all the different clouds while still servicing that [existing] customer base,&#8221; Confluent CEO and co-founder Jay Kreps told Ron.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing the existing business and building something new are both pretty hard problems, so that was the big challenge for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kreps and Ron also spoke about how the dual focus paid off to help Confluent become a $22-billion publicly listed company, its early days, and why founders should trust their instincts.</p>

<p>Sequoia Capital announced in October that it would create a new structure that rolled up all of its investments into a single fund.</p>
<p>“Our industry is still beholden to a rigid 10-year fund cycle pioneered in the 1970s,” wrote partner Roelof Botha in a blog post.</p>
<p>The move to a more permanent, Registered Investment Adviser model is meant to counter that, several U.K.-based VC investors told Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a fund like Sequoia with the strength of their LP relationships to even consider this kind of option,&#8221; Molten Ventures partner Vinoth Jayakumar said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Learn more about OpenView's annual Financial &#038; Operating Benchmarks report, which looks into numbers and best practices behind top of class SaaS performance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With capital in abundance, SaaS startups don&#8217;t seem to be too worried about how much runway they have remaining.</p>
<p>According to OpenView&#8217;s annual <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2021-financial-operating-benchmarks-report">Financial &amp; Operating Benchmarks report</a>, only 13% of nearly 600 companies surveyed named &#8220;burning too much cash&#8221; as one of their top three concerns, compared to 30% last year.</p>
<p>While 2020 was atypical and a rebound this year is not surprising, the report goes one step further, arguing that there is an increasing gap between the haves and have nots of B2B software.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more apparent, the authors claim, than when you look at public B2B SaaS companies. In an analysis accompanying the new report, they point out data showing that some companies see their enterprise value increase much faster than the competition.</p>
<p>The combination of an enormous market, a compelling growth engine and outstanding unit economics is helping top startups attract talent and capital, which might increasingly be escaping lower-performing companies, according to the report&#8217;s authors.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Investors have forgotten all about the Rule of 40.&#8221;							<cite>OpenView Partners</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But what does that mean for founders that aren&#8217;t anywhere near an IPO yet? And which benchmarks can they use to evaluate their performance? To find out, we talked to the report&#8217;s two lead co-authors, OpenView&#8217;s Vice President Sean Fanning and Operating Partner Kyle Poyar. We also reached out to Dale Chang, operating partner at Scale Venture Partners, which aggregates data of its own via its <a href="https://www.scalestudio.vc/">Scale Studio</a>; and to <a href="https://www.rippleventures.com/matt-cohen">Matt Cohen</a> from Canadian VC firm Ripple Ventures.</p>
<p>Our conversations covered some of the strategies SaaS companies can adopt to emulate their top peers — including product-led growth and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/more-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-pricing/"> usage-based pricing</a>, of which OpenView is a known advocate — as well as a lingering concern: Are the multiples we are seeing sustainable?</p>
<h2>Measuring up</h2>
<p>If we had to only retain one chart from OpenView&#8217;s report, it would be the benchmarks table below, which features a few metrics and separates them based on the respondents&#8217; annual recurring revenue (ARR):</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236398" style="width: 2244px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236398" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2236398 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Financial-and-operating-metrics-by-ARR-2021-OpenView.png" alt="Financial and operating metrics by ARR - 2021 - OpenView" width="2234" height="1240" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Financial-and-operating-metrics-by-ARR-2021-OpenView.png 2234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Financial-and-operating-metrics-by-ARR-2021-OpenView.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Financial-and-operating-metrics-by-ARR-2021-OpenView.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Financial-and-operating-metrics-by-ARR-2021-OpenView.png?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Financial-and-operating-metrics-by-ARR-2021-OpenView.png?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Financial-and-operating-metrics-by-ARR-2021-OpenView.png?resize=1536,853 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Financial-and-operating-metrics-by-ARR-2021-OpenView.png?resize=2048,1137 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Financial-and-operating-metrics-by-ARR-2021-OpenView.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2234px) 100vw, 2234px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236398" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OpenView Partners</p></div></p>
<p>A note to readers explains that &#8220;each cell represents the median performance of a company, as well as the range (bottom quartile and top quartile) of each metric at each respective ARR scale&#8221; with the median in bold and the range in parentheses.</p>
<p>The authors note that &#8220;benchmarks are the map, not the territory&#8221; and that &#8220;performance and valuation are a multivariate equation.&#8221; Still, the founder of a startup with ARR between $1 million and $2.5 million might be pleased to see that growing 100% year on year means outperforming the average SaaS company in that category. But they will also note that top-of-class companies grow by about a whopping 300%.</p>
<h2>All eyes on growth</h2>
<p>The median growth rate of SaaS businesses would already leave the average SMB in dismay, but the top quartile&#8217;s performance is on a different level, especially for early-stage companies. Just look at this chart:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The gaming community, developers and publishers are beginning to embrace accessibility as a core part of the business and hobby, but there&#8217;s a long way to go. <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/campaigns/research-policy/accessibility-in-gaming/#Interests-and-behaviours-among-disabled-gamers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A report on the needs and habits of disabled gamers in the U.K.</a> suggests that millions worldwide face difficulties regularly in how they play, buy or otherwise enjoy games.</p>
<p>Performed by disability advocacy organization Scope and compellingly contextualized by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-22-scopes-accessibility-in-gaming-report-gives-a-clear-sense-of-where-we-are-and-where-we-need-to-get-to" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer contributor Vivek Gohil</a>, the study polled 1,326 people (812 disabled, 514 not disabled) on the problems they face in the gaming world.</p>
<p>Two-thirds said they face barriers in gaming, most commonly the availability or affordability of assistive technology. Many say they&#8217;ve avoided buying games because of a lack of accessibility options, or have been unable to play (or return) games they bought which lacked such options.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238988" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Interestingly, disabled gamers are considerably more likely to buy in-game items, watch esports and otherwise engage with various platforms. As Gohil points out, just within the U.K. there are some 14 million disabled people commanding billions in disposable income; a large proportion of whom are active gamers, valuable ones at that; yet they are seldom considered a demographic worth advertising to or including in-game.</p>
<p>That does seem to be changing as more big developers realize that accessibility options make their games better for everyone. Major titles like the new Ratchet &amp; Clank, The Last of Us: Part II and Forza Horizon 5 include a wide variety of accommodations for everything from colorblindness to gameplay slowdown and granular difficulty options.</p>
<p>Better hardware is also on the way as small companies produce assistive devices for lots of different needs, and of course Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/microsoft-highlights-the-xbox-adaptive-controller-in-emotional-super-bowl-ad/">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a> has been a huge hit for people who can&#8217;t use traditional controllers.</p>
<p>The company also recently hosted an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/xbox-and-special-olympics-hold-first-gaming-for-inclusion-esports-event/">inclusion-focused esports tournament in collaboration with the Special Olympics</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LfNQQFWqf1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/xbox-and-special-olympics-hold-first-gaming-for-inclusion-esports-event/">Xbox and Special Olympics hold first &#8216;Gaming for Inclusion&#8217; esports event</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Xbox and Special Olympics hold first &#8216;Gaming for Inclusion&#8217; esports event&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/xbox-and-special-olympics-hold-first-gaming-for-inclusion-esports-event/embed/#?secret=LfNQQFWqf1" data-secret="LfNQQFWqf1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But they&#8217;ll be the first to admit that more needs to be done, and it&#8217;s not all engineering and development. In-game chat, notoriously toxic at the best of times, is positively horrific when people with disabilities join in, the Scope study found. In fact &#8220;doing more to tackle negative attitudes about disability online&#8221; was the most common priority cited by the respondents. More and better representation of people with disabilities in games, and more affordable assistive tech, were also rated as important.</p>
<p>The need for better accessibility in the gaming world is clear, but difficult to quantify — so studies like this one are particularly valuable. <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/campaigns/research-policy/accessibility-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can read the full report here</a>.</p>

The company previously planned to launch in late 2021.</p>
<p>Apple first announced the feature at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-drivers-license-ios-15-tsa-174600256.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>WWDC 2021</ins></a>. At the time, the company said the tool would allow you to add your driver’s license or state ID card to Apple Wallet just like you would a credit or debit card. Among the first locations that will support the feature will be select Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints at some US airports.</p>

<p>Outside of early 2022, Apple has not shared a specific release date for the feature. What’s clear is that it won’t arrive with iOS 15.2. That update is currently in beta testing and does not include support for storing digital IDs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh on the heels of Rocket Lab’s third successful booster recovery, CEO Peter Beck said the next step will be attempting to catch the booster mid-air using a helicopter, likely within the first half of next year.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab recovered the first stage of its Electron launcher during an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/rocket-labs-electron-booster-splashes-down-in-the-pacific-ocean/">ocean splashdown last week</a>, after the rocket delivered two BlackSky geospatial imaging satellites to low Earth orbit. The company stationed a helicopter near the splashdown area during that mission, but only for reconnaissance purposes. The ultimate goal for the company&#8217;s reusability program has always been to actually recover the booster in mid-air, and now it’s nearly upon them.</p>
<p>The main work to be done between now and then is helicopter readiness, Beck said during a call with reporters Tuesday. The aircraft that will be used for the mid-air catch attempt will be significantly heavier, and will have a significantly heavier payload capacity, than the one that was present at last week’s launch (the first stage weighs around 980 kilos).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The other part of it is slotting that flight and with a very, very busy manifest,” he said. “A priority is always making sure we deliver our customers on time. So that&#8217;s the next thing, but we certainly hope to have that flight within the first half of next year or as soon as practically possible, really.”</p>
<p>The company is planning a number of commercial flights between now and the mid-air recovery attempt, but these will be non-recovery missions. The next big learning opportunity for Rocket Lab will be once it is able to catch the booster and return it dry to the factory, Beck added.</p>
<p>Looking to next year, Beck said he foresees a busy year for the company, in part as a response to the ongoing coronavirus restrictions in New Zealand that have restricted Rocket Lab’s launch cadence throughout this year. While he didn’t speculate on how many launches the company might complete next year, he said he anticipated 2022 being the busiest year so far for the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the world quickly transitions into a global village thanks to the rapid penetration of internet networks, it is easy for some people to be left behind owing to the remoteness of their locations. In most parts of Zanzibar, an autonomous island in East Africa, for example, services by terrestrial cable and satellite networks are deficient, leaving a big percentage of the population uncovered. But, if plans by the <a href="https://worldmobile.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Mobile Group</a> &#8212; a global telecommunications operator &#8212; materialize, many Zanzibaris will be connecting to the internet for the first time in the next few months.</p>
<p>World Mobile is building infrastructure for last-mile connectivity using spectrums like free-space optical communication and other radio transmitters, which do not require licensing, translating to less expensive internet access.</p>
<p>The spectrums connect to multiple air nodes to create a mesh network, providing internet coverage to far-flung villages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237198" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“There&#8217;s a lot of fiber optics that have been laid throughout the continent, and we pick up on the last mile of fiber and use alternative spectrums like free-space optics, or other radio spectrums that do not require licensing,” World Mobile group CEO and founder Micky Watkins told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Watkins said that because they do not require licenses for these alternative spectrums they get a massive tax saving, which translates to cheaper internet for users.</p>
<p>“We use these alternative spectrums to build the backhaul (connection between an access node and the core network) and then create a device (node) that people can use to pick up from that backhaul,” said Watkins.</p>
<p>For sustainability, the air nodes will be owned by private entities, through a one-off fee of about $7,000 that they will recoup over time by earning income or rewards in the form of World Mobile Token (WMT), the operator’s cryptocurrency, as people connect to the internet through their access points. The network operator is working with micro-lenders in financing entrepreneurs to buy the nodes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Each air node provides reliable Wi-Fi internet to 500 to 700 people, and other ancillary utilities like public lighting through integrated solar-powered floodlights.</p>
<p>Watkins said the concept of a sharing economy reduces operational expenditures incurred in maintenance, security and leasing costs, while also powering a self-sustaining business model.</p>
<p>“And now the residents have a choice; do I own livestock or is it better for me to own part of a telecom infrastructure and run a telecommunications platform? This option was never there before; so, just like Uber or Airbnb, we are operating under the sharing economy model.”</p>
<p>World Mobile is currently serving about 3,000 customers on the five pilot sites, but has plans to expand to 30 sites by January &#8212; as it moves to fast-track the connectivity efforts.</p>
<p>Watkins said that current users spend about $4 a month on internet usage. The operator has a network of vendors where users onboard their fiat cash or buy WMT, the company’s digital currency, to connect to the internet.</p>
<p>World Mobile has a more ambitious plan of covering Zanzibar in five years, making internet available to the entire population of 1.5 million people, stepping up competition for traditional network companies like Zanlink and satellite internet companies like GlobalTT teleport and operator.</p>
<p>“We have a few deals that are coming through the pipeline that will allow us to have connectivity throughout the whole of Zanzibar, including the whole shoreline and in between mainland (Tanzania) and the borders of Zanzibar, allowing us to implement IoT, as well as connectivity for the people,” said Watkins.</p>
<p>The company is set to roll out the network in Kenya and Tanzania, where they already have operations, over the coming months.</p>
<p>“This is a movement, and this can be the biggest mobile network in the world that is run by the people. No one has ever done that before. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re actually going for,” said Watkins.</p>

<h2>How Zanzibar is tapping connectivity to build a digital economy</h2>
<p>As more citizens get connected, the Zanzibar government has started implementing its digital economy framework, a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/5289999/Zanzibar_eGovernment_Agenda_A_Way_Forward" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plan</a> it had shelved for over a decade.</p>
<p>Among the many ideas it had laid out and is now on course for includes tapping connectivity to grow its <a href="https://thecommonwealth.org/blue-economy#:~:text=The%20'Blue%20Economy'%20is%20an,ocean%20or%20'blue'%20resources.&amp;text=Similar%20to%20the%20'Green%20Economy,environmental%20risks%20and%20ecological%20scarcities.">blue economy</a> and to develop solutions that protect Zanzibar’s blue economy from illegal fishing trawlers.</p>
<p>Zanzibar’s ocean-based activities provide employment to 33% of its labor force and contribute more than <a href="https://uongozi.or.tz/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Realizing-the-Blue-Economy-in-Zanzibar_WP21_17.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29% of the island’s GDP,</a> but could realize more from its ocean-based wealth with better technologies.</p>
<p>It will also help in building infrastructure that will help it automate all its administrative tasks and processes. This means building an e-government system that would allow the interaction of government with its citizens, businesses, employees and between its agencies. The investment will make the government more accessible to its citizens, who no longer need to physically visit offices for services or information.</p>
<p>“The new administration is really focusing on digital transformation. We need to get there. But first we&#8217;re going to ensure that everybody can access the internet at an affordable rate,” said Said Seif Said, director general of the E-Government Agency of Zanzibar (eGaz).</p>
<p>The agency was established to promote policies, standards and other practices to improve ICT uptake across the public institutions.</p>
<p>“We might have a different solution like an integrated blue economy management system &#8212; which means we&#8217;re including satellite automatic identification systems, vessel management systems and drones. So, all this is to solve the problem of illegal unreported and unregistered fishing. And all these technologies need the connectivity to be in place.”</p>
<p>The urgency to digitize has partly been fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated Zanzibar’s plan for a digital government and economy. Zanzibar is now compensating for the time lost by quickening its pace toward that transition.</p>
<p>“The COVID pandemic has really changed how we do everything and we need to enable our citizens to do what they need to do from their homes. We have to ensure the sheer accessibility of government services countrywide in an affordable, effective and efficient manner through the appropriate use of ICT, and that&#8217;s where this collaboration with the World Mobile Group and Input Output Global (IOG) comes in,” he said.</p>
<p>In the partnership, IOG, a blockchain and digital identity firm behind Cardano blockchain, will automate Zanzibar’s systems by implementing blockchain technology in registry systems to provide “digital identifications with traceability”. It will also integrate back-end government systems to enable business-process automation and facilitate the flow of communication within government institutions.</p>
<p>World Mobile subscribers will access <a href="https://www.atalaprism.io/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atala PRISM</a>, IOG’s digital identity solution for services such as education, banking and healthcare.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zanzibar is launching a blockchain academy that will, beginning early next year, hold conferences as the tourist destination positions itself as a blockchain center of the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. We’re just starting to roll out this year’s gift guides, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2021/">check back from now until the end of December for more</a>! </em></p>
<p>Sometimes when you get mad about something silly on the internet, people will tell you, &#8220;go touch some grass.&#8221; But a few months back, when Mark Zuckerberg announced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/"> Facebook&#8217;s rebrand to Meta</a> and shared his vision of the metaverse, I felt an insatiable need to go outside so that I could literally touch grass. The development of new technology is exciting, but when it can feel a bit overwhelming, there&#8217;s nothing better than being surrounded by some green stuff.</p>
<p>Luckily, not all new technology wants to render us tethered to our VR headsets &#8212; some tech is designed to help us turn our homes into thriving gardens.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234094" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>An app to keep your plants alive</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2158063" style="width: 2790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158063" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2158063 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg-tc.jpg" alt="" width="2780" height="1880" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg-tc.jpg 2780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg-tc.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg-tc.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg-tc.jpg?resize=768,519 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg-tc.jpg?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg-tc.jpg?resize=1536,1039 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg-tc.jpg?resize=2048,1385 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/greg-tc.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2780px) 100vw, 2780px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158063" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Greg</p></div></p>
<p>The first startup I ever covered at TechCrunch was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/greg-an-app-for-plant-lovers-grows-5-4-million-in-seed-funding/">Greg</a>, an app that uses machine learning to help you know when to water your plants. When CEO Alex Ross saw my Zoom background &#8212; a large, forest tapestry that I bought for my freshman dorm seven years ago &#8212; he asked if I have plants. I told him that I can&#8217;t keep plants alive, because all of the windows in my apartment are north-facing.</p>
<p>He recommended some plants that can thrive in low light (snake plants, pothos, zz plants) and he guaranteed that if I used Greg, I could keep them alive. I was skeptical. Of course the co-founder of a plant app would tell you that if you use his app, you can keep your plants alive. But six months later, my snake plant, pothos and zz plant are all doing just fine. And I&#8217;ve become so obsessed with plants that here I am, writing the plant tech gift guide. Thanks, Greg.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Greg isn&#8217;t a miracle app. Even though monsteras need lots of light to thrive, I couldn&#8217;t resist how pretty they are, so I got one from a local plant nursery and placed it by the window at my desk. My hubris wounded me. It did not do well. So, I bought a relatively inexpensive grow light. Now, my monstera is doing great, and not to brag, but I&#8217;ve even kept a jade succulent standing up.</p>
<p>Greg won&#8217;t tell you, &#8220;Hey, your monstera desperately needs light because your apartment is dark and sad,&#8221; but you can change the settings on each individual plant you track on the app to indicate whether it&#8217;s on a grow light, since the amount of light a plant gets affects its watering cycle.</p>
<p>Greg is free for up to five plants, but you can buy unlimited access with Super Greg, which runs for $6.99 per month, $30 per year (so around $2.50 per month, if you pay annually) or $49.99 for lifetime access.</p>
<p>As Ross told TechCrunch: &#8220;Coinbase onboards people into crypto, Greg onboards people into plants.&#8221; A wild quote, but in my case, he was kind of right.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> From free to $7 per month. Available on <a href="https://greg.app/download/?utm_source=website_cta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS and Android</a></p>
<h2>Okay, now where do you buy the plants?</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2234282" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234282" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234282 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thesill.png" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thesill.png 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thesill.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thesill.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thesill.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thesill.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234282" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Sill</p></div></p>
<p>Among techy startup people, you&#8217;ll probably hear about <a href="https://www.thesill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sill</a>, an online retailer selling plants. Founder Eliza Blank is an investor in <a href="https://greg.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg</a> &#8212; small world!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not fortunate enough to live in walking distance of multiple plant nurseries, ordering online can be a good option, but oof. Some of these plants are pricey for stuff that literally grows on trees! (Looking for free cuttings? Check to see if there&#8217;s a plant exchange group for your neighborhood.)</p>
<p>But if you want to send something nice to a friend for the holidays, you&#8217;re probably not going to buy a snake plant from your local plant shop, box it up and bring it to the UPS store. So in that case, sure, buy that <a href="https://www.thesill.com/products/snake-plant-laurentii?variant=30412141690985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$60 snake plant and chic, modern planter</a>. And honestly, without the overpriced (but pretty!) planters you can buy a snake plant for <a href="https://www.thesill.com/products/snake-plant-laurentii?variant=39521020313705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as low as $23</a>, which isn&#8217;t much more than what you&#8217;d probably pay at a nursery. So go treat yourself. Just don&#8217;t get the <a href="https://www.thesill.com/products/monstera-deliciosa?variant=31411322028137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monstera</a> unless you have lots of natural light or are willing to invest in a grow light.</p>
<p>Modern Sprout also makes indoor garden kits designed to hand-hold habitual plant killers through growing things from <a href="https://store.modsprout.com/products/terracotta-grow-kits-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cacti</a> to <a href="https://store.modsprout.com/products/garden-jar-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edible herbs</a>. But again, even if you follow the directions closely, your plants need light to survive. So…</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s talk grow lights</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, your standard lightbulb won&#8217;t give your plants the light they need to thrive. So if you aren&#8217;t fortunate enough to have a sun-drenched salon in your home, grow lights are crucial to making sure you can still enjoy an indoor oasis &#8212; or, at least, one that isn&#8217;t filled exclusively with snake plants.</p>
<h3>Best on a budget</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2234274" style="width: 1408px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234274" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234274 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png" alt="" width="1398" height="1054" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png 1398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png?resize=300,226 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png?resize=768,579 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png?resize=680,513 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-15-at-2.50.26-PM.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1398px) 100vw, 1398px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234274" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Juhefa LED Grow Light</p></div></p>
<p>I bought myself this grow light when I was skeptical about whether my monstera was dying because it hates me, or because it needed more light. So I didn&#8217;t want to invest in any super high-tech setup when I was still, as Greg CEO Alex Ross would say, &#8220;onboarding into plants.&#8221; At $24, this one&#8217;s the best bang for your buck. You can program it to adhere to a daily schedule and it has a very strong clamp to keep the gooseneck LEDs in place. Honestly, I can&#8217;t really say anything more than the fact that it works. No complaints. But maybe you want something prettier?</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $24 on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TFHFP7Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07TFHFP7Q&amp;linkId=5aa1b2fc86883190ac43b5e50399734c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a></p>
<h3>This one&#8217;s just ridiculously pretty</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2234272" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234272" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234272 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="854" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growframe.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234272" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Modern Sprout Growframe</p></div></p>
<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t have enough space for your plants. Why not make more room on your walls? If a picture is worth 1,000 words, plants are worth … probably also about a thousand. We&#8217;re not here to slander the fine arts.</p>
<p>But if all the art you own is stored in your crypto wallet (sigh), your walls might be looking bare, so why not hang up your plants in an LED grow frame? Depending on the size and shape, these frames run about $200, which isn&#8217;t cheap, but again: They&#8217;re <em>pretty</em>. Still, before you invest, make sure you know how to hang an eight-pound piece of tech on your wall. You don&#8217;t want this thing to come crashing down, especially if you have plants on it!</p>
<p>The frame&#8217;s LEDs can be controlled and set on a timer with the Modern Sprout app. These are full-spectrum white LEDs, so while they&#8217;ll still grow your plants, you won&#8217;t have to deal with the obtrusive red and blue colors that other grow lights use. Again, this thing isn&#8217;t magic &#8212; you&#8217;re going to want to be smart about which plants can thrive on your wall, presumably not near a window, receiving only artificial light. May I suggest a <a href="https://www.thesill.com/blogs/plants-101/how-to-care-for-jade-crassula-ovata?_pos=1&amp;_sid=b45d944a3&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jade succulent</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $200 at <a href="https://store.modsprout.com/products/smart-growframe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Sprout</a></p>
<h3>Not enough books on your bookshelf?</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2234266" style="width: 1254px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234266" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2234266 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg" alt="" width="1244" height="1400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg 1244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg?resize=267,300 267w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg?resize=768,864 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg?resize=604,680 604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/glowbar.jpeg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 1244px) 100vw, 1244px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234266" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Modern Sprout Grow Bar</p></div></p>
<p>Got a lot of bookshelves and not enough books? More plant space!</p>
<p>The Modern Sprout Smart Growbar is a bit cheaper than the Growframe at $119, and it attaches via velcro to the underside of a cabinet or shelf to keep your plants happy.</p>
<p>If your bookshelf is full, why not build an herb garden in your kitchen? If you don&#8217;t eat fresh basil on a regular basis … I&#8217;m sorry. But this Growbar can help with that. Like the Growframe, this device is app-enabled and emits only natural white LED light.</p>

<p>Soltech&#8217;s grow lights are designed to look like luxury light fixtures that also just so happen to be designed to help plants grow. The $75 <a href="https://www.soltechsolutions.com/product/vita-grow-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vita Grow Light</a> can screw into any existing light fixture you have, but it&#8217;s far heavier than a traditional lightbulb. So, for instance, if you live in an apartment that gets very little natural light and your landlord included some very cheap floor lamps as a gesture of good faith, maybe don&#8217;t use your Vita in those very flimsy lamps. But if your lighting doesn&#8217;t resemble what you&#8217;d find in a college dorm, you&#8217;re probably good to go with the Vita. Like other high-end grow lights, the Vita emits a warm, natural light, so you won&#8217;t even know it&#8217;s a special kind of lightbulb. No blues and reds here!</p>
<p>If you want to get extra fancy, Soltech also sells light fixtures that <a href="https://www.soltechsolutions.com/product/aspect-plant-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hang from your ceiling</a> or <a href="https://www.soltechsolutions.com/product/highland-track-light-system-international/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drill into your wall</a>.</p>

<h2>Plants need water, too</h2>
<p>Now that your plants are well lit, how do you keep them watered? Let&#8217;s say, hypothetically, you&#8217;re going out of town for over a month, live alone in a badly lit apartment and your landlord won&#8217;t give you a second fob key unless you pay $75, and you&#8217;re too stubborn for that. So that means you can&#8217;t give a friend a key to water your plants while you&#8217;re gone. How can you keep your plants watered without human intervention?</p>
<h3>Add some modern style to your plants while keeping them hydrated</h3>

<p>Plantstraws, run by founder Elin Fyhr and her father, sells handmade products designed and produced in a small, Stockholm studio. The product spruces up a well-known DIY trick for plant watering, in which you dampen a string and run it between a bowl of water and your plant&#8217;s roots. This product essentially does the same thing, running a rope through a brass metal tube that looks way more stylish than a DIY setup.</p>
<p>Though Plantstraws is based in Sweden, they ship around the world. A plant straw is about $30, and though they don&#8217;t come with the beautiful glassware shown in the product photos, they still look good with a mason jar, an old wine bottle or whatever else you have lying around. Even when you&#8217;re not out of town, you can use plant straws to keep your plants healthy &#8212; but it&#8217;s better to use them on plants that require a decent amount of water, like a money tree or a peace lily, as opposed to a plant that wants dry soil, like a succulent or snake plant.</p>

<h2>Just go ahead and literally turn your home into a garden</h2>
<p>Speaking of water: hydroponic gardens? Extremely cool. It&#8217;s amazing what you can grow with just the right amount of light and water, even if you&#8217;re growing plants in a dark apartment with no porch to grow a big ol&#8217; tomato plant on. Growing plants is great, but you know what&#8217;s even better? Growing plants that you can eat.</p>
<h3>If you want to feel like you&#8217;re living in a high-tech Stardew Valley</h3>

<p>If you simply cannot get enough of your indoor plants and love fresh produce, you might want to invest in a family-sized smart garden. Winter is approaching. Why trek through the snow to get groceries when you can have fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs and even (non-edible!) flowers blooming in your home?</p>
<p>The Click and Grow Smart Garden 27 comes with three <a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/products/the-smart-garden-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Garden 9s</a> (generally $200+ each), plus a sturdy, wooden plant stand, which is surprisingly easy to assemble. Since the whole system sells for $600, it&#8217;s actually a good deal if you were going to buy three individual smart gardens anyway. That might seem steep, but some competitors like the (also very pretty) <a href="https://mygardyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gardyn</a> are even more expensive.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: You place Click and Grow&#8217;s plant pods into the Smart Gardens (you can grow a total of 27 pods at once in the Smart Garden 27, as its name suggests). Then, you pour water into the device&#8217;s reservoir until it&#8217;s filled. While you wait for the seeds to sprout, you place plastic domes on top of each pod, which speeds up the process &#8212; once they start peeking out of the soil, you remove the domes and let them grow.</p>
<p>The Smart Garden 27 comes with nine basil pods, nine tomato pods and nine lettuce pods to start. The pods can also be purchased separately in packs of three for $10, averaging out to $3.33 per pod. With Click and Grow&#8217;s <a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/pages/click-grow-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscription</a> service, you can order in bundles for as low as $1.64 per pod. There&#8217;s a wide variety in what you can grow, like cilantro, blue petunias, kale, bell peppers, wild strawberries, white snapdragons, peas, chives, catnip, arugula and more. Click and Grow also sells &#8220;<a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/products/grow-anything-indoors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grow Anything</a>&#8221; soil pods, which let you add your own seeds to grow whatever you want.</p>
<p>Click and Grow&#8217;s smart gardens all use similar technology, so if you&#8217;re looking for something a bit less intense (and expensive), try Click and Grow&#8217;s $140 <a href="https://www.clickandgrow.com/products/the-smart-garden-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Garden 3</a>, which can grow three plant pods at once. Put it in your kitchen so you can grow fresh basil, rosemary and parsley year-round.</p>
