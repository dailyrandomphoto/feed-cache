										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapdragon&#8217;s G3x is Qualcomm&#8217;s fantastically exciting bid to embrace the gaming market — a brand new reach for the manufacturer, which introduces powerful GPUs, 5G-enabled connectivity, the ability to power external screens, immersive audio capabilities, haptic feedback and a slew of other features that handheld gaming manufacturers have had to cobble together from other sources. Uniting all of this in a single platform is new — and might mean a renaissance of handheld gaming, unlike anything we&#8217;ve ever seen before. Razer today showed off a developer kit based on the new platform, kick-starting an exciting new era in handheld gaming.</p>
<p>The rapid development in mobile phone technologies have been unlocking new products in all sorts of categories for a couple of decades. People are now so used to iPads that we don&#8217;t accept crappy airline check-in kiosks anymore. We&#8217;re so used to excellent battery life and high-speed internet, that anything that falls short of it sparks impatience and frustration. Relatively affordable consumer-grade quadcopter drones only became possible when accelerometers and processors became cheap enough for consumer electronics tinkerers to take existing components and put them together in new and interesting ways.</p>
<p>The march of technology advances is never-ending — and it&#8217;s ever so exciting to see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-m1-max-launched/">Apple launch its own ludicrously powerful processors</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/with-tensor-google-bets-on-its-own-chip-design-for-the-pixel-6/">when Google shows off the Tensor processors in the newest-generation Pixel phones</a>, you&#8217;d better believe we lean in for a closer look. These are technologies that will have far-reaching impacts in the computing world, but they live in the siloed universes of Apple and Google respectively. Fun, sure, but where the real impact of new processors can be felt by the startup-loving readership of this very publication, is when the OEM manufacturers flex their vision for the future. In short — as a startup, you&#8217;re probably not going to be able to get your hands on an Apple M1 Max or a Google Tensor for your own hardware devices. The same isn&#8217;t true for Qualcomm and its Snapdragon silicon.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240815" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Qualcomm is in the unusual space of making processors that are powering the entire world around us. This is the technology that&#8217;s going to be powering everything from fridges to cars to drones to … well, anything you can possibly imagine, really. SnapDragon 8 lives in smartphones across the world. The 4100+ platform powers wearables. XR2 with its 5G chipset is going to be doing the heavy lifting for AR/VR applications. The 8cx processors will be living in tablets and PCs — and we&#8217;ve seen the Snapdragon Ride platform turn up in cars. Seeing Qualcomm taking a serious look at the gaming market is interesting, taking deep niche products like the Nintendo Switch and giving hardware manufacturers a toolkit to build their own, powerful handheld gaming console platforms.</p>
<p>More than just tossing together a pile of chips and wishing console developers a happy journey, Qualcomm made the ever-so-shrewd move to partner with gaming veteran Razer to build a developer kit, so software developers can start getting busy while the hardware manufacturing world spools up its product development afterburners.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 Gaming Platform delivers cutting-edge performance and the entire arsenal of Snapdragon Elite Gaming technologies to run all Android games, play content from cloud gaming libraries, stream games from a home console or PC and much more. Available today, the platform is a battle cry for market dominance — and it&#8217;s going to be spectacularly interesting to see this one play out.</p>

<p>The platform has a lot that is particularly interesting, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Qualcomm Adreno GPU, which promises 144 frames per second and 10-bit HDR for gaming in over a billion shades of color.</li>
<li>A built-in 1080p60 webcam with two microphones for livestreaming the gaming action to audiences.</li>
<li>A full battery of connectivity options using Qualcomm&#8217;s FastConnect 6900 Mobile Connectivity suite. That means Wi-Fi 6 and 6E for low latency and fast upload and download speeds. 5G mm Wave and sub-6 for cloud gaming while streaming the most bandwidth-intensive games from services like Xbox Cloud Gaming or Steam Remote Play.</li>
<li>Incredible display: 6.65-inch OLED display with Full HD+ resolution and 10-bit HDR, operating at up to 120 hz.</li>
<li>Snapdragon Sound technology, optimized for quality, latency and robustness, giving gamers the option to pinpoint opponents aurally. On-device 4-way speakers provide fantastic audio and when paired with Snapdragon Sound-enabled earbuds, gamers can experience lag-free wireless audio.</li>
<li>Multiscreen experience can tether to an AR/VR viewer via USB-C. The same tech also enables the device to act as a companion controller to a TV with up to 4K resolution.</li>
<li>Controls: The developer kit has built-in controller mapping from AKSys to provide precise touch to controller mapping technology to enable use of the built-in controllers across a wide array of games.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Razer is extremely excited to partner with Qualcomm Technologies and support them on their way to introduce new cutting-edge technology to the global gaming industry,” says Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO. “Together, Qualcomm Technologies and Razer will lead the way with new and innovative solutions that push the boundaries of fidelity and quality available in portable gaming, transforming the way these games are experienced.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fintech giant Square is changing its name to <a href="https://www.block.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block</a>, effective December 10. The name change, which has been in the works for <a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158918724472837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a year</a>, is intended to house the company&#8217;s various products &#8212; including music streaming service Tidal, Cash App, TBD, and of course, Square &#8212; under one brand.</p>
<p>This announcement comes just days after Square founder and CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">stepped down</a> from his CEO role at Twitter, which he also co-founded.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re changing our company name so we can give the full <a href="https://twitter.com/Square?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Square</a> brand to our Seller business. So now we need a name to tie <a href="https://twitter.com/Square?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Square</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CashApp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TIDAL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TIDAL</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/TBD54566975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TBD54566975</a> together into one. That name is “Block.” Why? <a href="https://t.co/vVSKNnMUU3">https://t.co/vVSKNnMUU3</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241817" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Square (@Square) <a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158910067388423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“We built the Square brand for our Seller business, which is where it belongs,” said Dorsey in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211201006139/en/Square-Inc.-Changes-Name-to-Block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>. “Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same. No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy.”</p>
<p>The name Block is also a nod to the company&#8217;s growing interest in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. The existing Square Crypto product will also be renamed to Spiral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Block references the neighborhood blocks where we find our sellers, a blockchain, block parties full of music, obstacles to overcome, a section of code, building blocks, and of course, tungsten cubes,&#8221; the company <a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158911413760004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a Tweet</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Square isn&#8217;t the first major tech company to rebrand this year, of course. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/#:~:text=Facebook%20creator%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20announced,our%20company%20is%20now%20Meta.">changed its corporate branding</a> to Meta just over a month ago, as the company faced increased scrutiny <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the press</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">in Congress</a>. But like Square, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg felt that the Facebook brand didn&#8217;t represent the company&#8217;s growth to include products like Instagram, WhatsApp, Horizon and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-errr-meta-unceremoniously-kills-off-oculus-brand/">Quest</a>.</p>
<p>Square even referenced the timing of this rebrand in its <a href="https://twitter.com/Square/status/1466158911413760004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>: &#8220;Not to get all meta on you … but we&#8217;re going to!&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Square <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/the-next-generation-of-global-payments-afterpay-square/">merged with Afterpay</a>, a buy now, pay later product. The company&#8217;s Cash App also recently expanded to allow teens aged 13 to 17 to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/squares-cash-app-opens-up-to-teens-ages-13-to-17-with-parental-oversight/#:~:text=Square's%20Cash%20App%20opens%20up,17%20with%20parental%20oversight%20%7C%20TechCrunch">open accounts</a> with parental oversight, while Tidal is preparing for a shift toward <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/tidal-is-investing-direct-artist-payments-a-step-toward-fair-streaming-payouts/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">direct artist royalty payments</a> in the new year.</p>
<p>Block&#8217;s NYSE ticker symbol SQ will remain the same. The company also added that there will be no organizational changes at this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re just starting to build out a smart home, look no further than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/smart-home-gift-guide-ideas/">Zack Whittaker&#8217;s excellent starter kit guide</a>, which should lay the groundwork for a connected home experience. But if you&#8217;ve already taken the plunge and find yourself with the key ingredients in place for a smart home, let&#8217;s look at some options that can take it to the next level for a truly divine digital domicile.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this guide, I&#8217;m going to assume that the giftee on your list (which can be you, no shame) already has a lot of the basics in place, like smart lighting, a connected thermostat, etc. That said, I&#8217;m going to specifically suggest a few things that work with particular brands of the above, like the Philips Hue smart lighting system, which I continue to maintain is the best and most consistently reliable.</p>

<h2>Lights you never think about</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2241638" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2241638" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241638" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="733" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg?resize=768,563 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg?resize=680,498 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hue-sensors.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2241638" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Signify</p></div></p>
<p>I have long had smart lighting, across multiple homes over many years. But only more recently did I introduce a key quality-of-life upgrade into the mix that made smart lighting more than just a convenience and into something much more transformative that I now really couldn&#8217;t live without.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about motion sensors. It may seem simple, but I at first balked at picking any up because they&#8217;re actually fairly pricy and rarely go on sale. Specifically, the ones I find the best are the Hue sensors, including both their indoor and outdoor versions depending on your needs. I&#8217;ve tried HomeKit sensors (and the Hue sensors can act as HomeKit sensors, too) but they just don&#8217;t work as reliably as when you&#8217;re working within Hue&#8217;s ecosystem with its own smart lights and sensors.</p>
<p>Even after I stopped being amazed by it, guests have many times commented on how remarkable it is to walk through our house and have lights just &#8220;magically&#8221; turn on when they enter a room or area. Being able to change the light&#8217;s intensity and other behavior based on time of day is also key.</p>

<p>I walk the dog every morning and one thing I&#8217;ve become very accustomed to is checking the weather to see how to dress before I leave. A range of apps can offer local forecasts, and a lot are even quite granular, but nothing compares to being able to check the weather immediately outside your door from your device.</p>
<p>There are a number of connected weather stations available, but the best for me in terms of value for money, features and privacy is the Eve Weather. It&#8217;s specifically made for HomeKit, so it&#8217;s best for people already in the Apple connected home ecosystem, but if that is you or the person you&#8217;re shopping for, the Eve Weather is perfect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an IPX4 water resistance-rated aluminum puck, powered by a single CR2450 replaceable battery. It sets up in minutes, handles all connectivity locally and works with Siri for voice requests about weather conditions. The Eve Weather tracks temperature, as well as humidity and barometric pressure, and can provide you with weather trends for up to 12 hours based on all those signals.</p>

<p>In general, I don&#8217;t put a lot of stock in connected kitchen gadgets (see what I did there) but some of the more experienced appliance makers have started to figure out where it makes sense to add smarts to old favorites, and how to do so in a way that results in a reliable and consistent piece of hardware.</p>
<p>Instant Pot is a regular Black Friday shopper&#8217;s favorite, but this year it&#8217;s worth taking a special look at one item in their increasingly vast range: The Instant Pot Pro Plus Smart Multi-Cooker. This 6-quart cooker has all the pressure cooking goodness you expect out of the brand, as well as steaming, sous vide, rice cooking and more, but it also integrates with a receipt app powered by smart cooking company Drop.</p>
<p>The recipes are great and a nice feature, but my main reason for suggesting this Instant Pot versus others is the handy remote control of functions like cooking time and pressure level, as well as remote pressure release right from your device via the Instant Brands app.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve included the Brilliant Control in past TC Gift Guides, but it really is just that good, and usage over time has only reinforced that. The Brilliant Control is a touchscreen smart home controller that you install in place of a standard light switch using existing wiring (it&#8217;s easy to do regardless of your level of skill and experience — just remember to cut power at the breaker).</p>
<p>The Brilliant Control panels all include a built-in camera for local network-based video intercom functionality, and the software is compatible with a wide range of smart home devices, including Sonos systems, Hue lights, Ring doorbells and many more. You can assign specific lights and speakers to individual panels, too, so that they can control specifically the lights and playback in the room they&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>I can recall some adventurous smart home DIY pioneers trying to cobble together a system like this using iPod touches and hacky mounts, but Brilliant makes it remarkably easy to build a smart home system that rivals a lot of those you&#8217;ll find in expensive custom pre-build installations. They also come in up to four-switch panels for whatever bank of switches you want to replace.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Varies based on configuration; as pictured above, <a href="https://www.brilliant.tech/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$449 from Brilliant</a></p>

<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s Greg Kumparak dropped by to add this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>Being able to lock your front door from an app — or, better yet, with your voice while lying in bed — rules.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using Yale&#8217;s smart door lock for years, and I&#8217;ve been nothing but pleased. There&#8217;s a Nest x Yale version for people in Google&#8217;s ecosystem, or the slightly more expensive &#8220;Assure&#8221; model that&#8217;s more broadly compatible with Google, Alexa, HomeKit, etc. The battery life is solid (4 AAs. Buy rechargeables!), and if you somehow ignore the loud &#8220;battery low&#8221; warning for too long, a 9V battery will kick-start it long enough to let you punch in your PIN.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s arguments to be made that physical security shouldn&#8217;t be trusted to the cloud … but, for most people, I&#8217;d counter that a burglar is more likely to bust in through your window than they are to hack your spaceman door lock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fairly easy to install, but make sure to double-check it&#8217;s physically compatible with your door — and even if it is, don&#8217;t be surprised if you have to do some sanding/chiseling to make everything sit just right.</p></blockquote>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It seems like just yesterday that exchanges like Coinbase opened the eyes of the traditional economy to the benefits that cryptocurrencies offer as an asset class.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies and other decentralized technologies have created applications that promise to create real social value by offering an automated way to establish trust, but at a much lower cost than traditional intermediaries (banks and governments) that have monopolized trust as a service.</p>
<p>Building on the decentralized revolution, forward thinkers are already talking about the next big breakthrough — the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO — that can guarantee trust at the organizational level. But while the problems DAOs might solve are real, DAO proponents misunderstand the nature of these problems and offer a tool that creates more harm than benefit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241545" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Decentralized applications are built on smart contracts &#8212; algorithms that run when predetermined conditions are met and, by doing so, automate common decisions. Smart contracts create trust by guaranteeing predictability; when a predetermined set of actions occur, you will get paid in tokens.</p>
<p>Enthusiasts look at DAOs as the next logical step to this trust-building process by bundling a series of smart contracts to create what they describe as a smart “organization” &#8212; where business decisions like inventory control, cash management, pricing and even hiring are made based on predetermined inputs.</p>
<p>For an extreme example, think about an Amazon third-party reseller. This business operates on a number of simple inputs &#8212; the level of interest in its various products, the cost of raw materials and production at different facilities, shipping costs and so on. Based on these predetermined inputs, the value for an investor of the business should be pretty simple to determine, and a DAO would eliminate managers making bad — or self-interested — decisions.</p>
<p>Business owners are constantly making decisions that may be suboptimal from an investor perspective for reasons that are at best opaque and far too often made for personal benefit. For example, the decision to switch to a higher-cost manufacturer could be a hedge against product returns based on poor quality, or it could be because the new manufacturer is the owner’s cousin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With a DAO, the entire business could be run with no humans at all, with all decisions made by a series of smart contracts. If a certain line of products is not selling, production decreases automatically, and price may also decrease until inventory is reduced. As sales increase, production increases. As production costs increase, price increases and so on. And profits would accrue to DAO investors that had, in turn, made investment decisions made based on preset (and preapproved) smart contracts.</p>
<p>But this very reliance on smart contracts solving small problems remains subject to what proponents misleadingly call the edge cases. What if there is a strike or a fire at a manufacturer? It is hard to imagine a smart contract anticipating better than a human manager when it is safe to resume placing orders with them.</p>
<p>This is why businesses use traditional contracts in addition to smart contracts &#8212; the reality is that the world of business relationships is far more messy and multivalent than can be predicted by a series of smart contracts. DAOs, of course, could continue to retain humans (as employees or as consultants) to solve these kinds of edge cases, but I question whether humans would want to get called in to clean up smart contract messes.</p>
<p>Decentralized finance has created value by more effectively validating quantifiable economic decisions. This has been successful because an automated trust mechanism for simple (or even complex) transactions has a simple metric (economic value) to measure the benefit of the decision.</p>
<p>But there is a profound difference between solving for trust in transactions and creating trust in relationships, let alone in organizations or communities. People gain economic value from transactions, but they gain other, different kinds of value from being a part of relationships and organizations. From being a part of an organization, we derive a sense of place, and from this sense of place, ultimately a sense of self.</p>
<p>This sense of place is derived from the web of reciprocal relationships that are constantly being renegotiated between one another and within a group. And in an organizational relationship, we constantly have to weigh between competing values in making a decision &#8212; should I do something that doesn’t make economic sense, but makes it more likely that someone will help me in the future?</p>
<p>Pierre Bourdieu described the totality of these values as a field and stressed that each person’s field is constituted differently based on their accumulated historical and cultural circumstances. According to Bourdieu, to master these relationships, one needs not an all-purpose algorithm, but an intuition that he called a “sense of the game.”</p>
<p>This sense of the game is what separates a visionary from a good businessman. And, more importantly, it is what separates a good person from a good manager. For me, the ultimate proof that a DAO can replace our existing flawed business organizations is when a smart contract can decide that it is a good time to give an employee the day off. If you are a DeFi enthusiast, that should be your challenge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Credit card companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/everyone-loves-bnpl/">are seeking to push further</a> into the “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) market. American Express (Amex) announced today that it plans to partner with Opy, the U.S. subsidiary of Australian fintech Openpay, to allow all of its U.S. cardmembers to pay in installments for qualifying purchases in the healthcare and automotive segments.</p>
<p>The partnership is American Express’s first third-party BNPL agreement in the United States, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch in an email. Amex will help onboard merchants in these sectors onto its platform.</p>
<p>Opy describes its solution as an improved version of the traditional BNPL model, which it calls “buy now, pay smarter.” Opy will lend up to $20,000 at once to a customer, charging them a fixed fee and offering plans as long as 24 months, unlike the shorter-term installments offered by companies like Affirm and Klarna.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241698" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>American Express <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2020/american-express-expands-bnpl-options-for-cardholders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already offers</a> its own BNPL options under its “Pay it Plan it” program launched in 2017 for purchases above $100, which also offers a fixed interest rate. The Opy partnership will help Amex meet demand for options to finance large purchases over longer periods of time, Opy U.S. CEO Brian Shniderman told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“If it&#8217;s a big item &#8212; and this is where we specialize &#8212; things that are $1,000 to $20,000, 60 days isn&#8217;t really enough time to pay off something that&#8217;s more expensive,” he said.</p>
<p>The company is able to offer lower rates, never higher than 9.99%, because it targets very specific sectors that attract financially savvy customers, per Shniderman. Its average customer is 40 years old, while many other BNPL providers’ average customers are in their 20s, he added. Besides healthcare and automotive, Opy offers financing for home improvement and educational certification, though those two verticals are not set to be included in the Amex partnership.</p>
<p>“[Our product is] predictable, transparent. If you look at the other buy, now pay later companies out there, they have deferred interest, there&#8217;s back interest if you miss a payment. They recalculate all of that 0% interest as though you had a very high interest rate for the life of the loan,” Shniderman, who worked closely with Amex in his prior role at Deloitte, said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amex’s major competitors have also made recent forays into BNPL in an attempt to keep pace with payments companies like Stripe and Square. Mastercard launched its homegrown Mastercard Installments offering this fall, and Visa announced a brand partnership with Klarna shortly thereafter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One day after announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/">an amendment to its SPAC agreement</a>, digital mortgage lender Better.com confirmed today that it is laying off roughly 9% of its nearly 10,000 person staff.</p>
<p>Doing the math, that amounts to about 900 people.</p>
<p>The company declined to comment beyond the following written statement from CFO Kevin Ryan: &#8220;A fortress balance sheet and a reduced and focused workforce together set us up to play offense going into a radically evolving homeownership market.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241727" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>People familiar with internal happenings in the company, which is set to go public in the near future at a $6.9 billion valuation, told TechCrunch that a few factors drove the decision behind the staff reductions.</p>
<p>For one, the mortgage market is expected to contract pretty significantly after 18 months of rapid expansion driven by historically lower interest rates. Better has been vocal about its desire to build out its purchase experience and move beyond digital lending to help people find and purchase homes. It’s also working to expand value-added offerings like title and homeowner’s insurance as part of its product suite.</p>
<p>Bottom line, the company has “too many people in the wrong places,” according to our sources, who preferred to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>This also appears to be a case of technology replacing human labor. Better’s automation efforts means fewer manual process and a business that is more machine-driven, hence the need for fewer human resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The layoffs are primarily taking place in the U.S. and India, the sources said.</p>
<p>On Nov. 30, TechCrunch reported that the company was getting a cash infusion from its backers sooner than expected. Blank-check company Aurora Acquisition Corp. and SoftBank decided to amend the terms of their financing agreement to provide Better with half of the $1.5 billion they committed immediately instead of waiting until the deal closes.</p>
<p>No word on whether the company has been in a cash crunch, but an email from CFO Ryan to employees obtained by TechCrunch revealed that Better would have about $1 billion on its balance sheet by week’s end. It’s possible that the layoffs were a condition to getting that deal approved.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Content marketers today face a constant struggle between keeping up with the volume of content they’re expected to produce and getting creative to produce rich, quality work that deeply impacts their audience.</p>
<p>Content marketing is recognized as a powerful tool, driving higher conversions than traditional marketing. However, the teams creating that content are using an outdated playbook that focuses on serving algorithms before audiences by constantly churning out posts targeting bots over brains.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			An amplified marketing strategy fosters a connection between your audience and the expertise they’re seeking.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://marketinginsidergroup.com/content-marketing/biggest-content-marketing-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accenture survey</a> of more than 1,000 marketing executives across the globe, respondents were unanimous: Content overload is a top challenge. And 50% said they currently have more content than they are fully prepared to manage.</p>
<p>The strategies that made content marketing so riveting at its start haven’t evolved to meet the challenges of today’s marketers as they compete for their audience’s attention in a vast landscape of newsletters, podcasts, video series, blogs and social media.</p>
<p>With too much content to create or manage and too little time to measure its success or repurpose what they’ve already created, marketers need a new plan of action that puts creativity before quantity, audience before engine, and sets connection as the top priority. They need an amplified marketing strategy.</p>
<h2>What is amplified marketing?</h2>
<p>The amplified marketing approach puts captivating conversations at the center of your content strategy. Those conversations — with industry experts, customers, internal thought leaders, influencers and decision-makers — serve as the source material for all your marketing assets, streamlining your content creation, aligning your teams across channels and giving your audience the insights they’re seeking.</p>
<p>Amplified marketing turns to powerful metrics to identify what resonates with an audience and what’s not catching on. By extracting more value from the content they create and assessing its success, marketers can work more efficiently, effectively and creatively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Start with a conversation</h2>
<p>Amplified marketing starts with a good conversation with someone who knows what they’re talking about on a topic your audience wants to explore. How do you do that? Bring the focus back to the audience.</p>
<p>Consider what questions they need answered, what new ideas they’re missing out on and what subjects excite or inspire them. Instead of developing a list of topics for content marketers to research and write about, put together a list of people who can offer your audience those answers, insights and big ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, at AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas, the company announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/expedite-conversation-design-with-the-automated-chatbot-designer-in-amazon-lex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Amazon Lex automated chat bot designer in preview</a>, a new feature that simplifies the chatbot training and design process by bringing a level of automation to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to announce the Amazon Lex automated chat bot designer, a new capability that reduces bot design from weeks to just hours,&#8221; Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of Amazon AI told the audience at the AI and machine learning keynote today.</p>
<p>It does this by taking advantage of advanced natural language understanding powered by deep learning techniques. In fact, he said that developers can now create a foundational chatbot designed using historical call transcripts in just a few clicks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;[The Amazon Lex] automated chat bot designer can typically analyze 10,000 lines of transcripts within a couple of hours to identify intents such as &#8216;file a new claim&#8217; or &#8216;check claim status.&#8217; It makes sure these intents are well separated and there is no overlap between them, eliminating the need for a trial and error approach,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>He said that without this automation, it&#8217;s a highly manual and tedious developer task. &#8220;The organizational design of a chatbot is highly complex, manual and prone to errors. It requires understanding the nuances of a spoken language and human interactions, and without this specific expertise, developers spend hundreds of hours combing through all the historic called transcripts to find things like common user requests and the required information to to solve this problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you think about a common use case for AI, chatbots certainly come to mind. They may be designed for in-house use to answer questions about how to order a new computer or get your newborn child on the company health insurance, or they may act as a customer service front end to collect vital information and answer simple questions, while funneling more complex questions to a human customer service agent.</p>
<p>Many startups have launched to make it easier to create more accurate chatbots, but it&#8217;s also low-hanging fruit for a company like Amazon, whose customers may be looking for a solution on the platform to go with their other AI and machine learning projects.</p>
<p>The Amazon Lex automated chat builder is available starting today in preview. Developers can use this feature for free during the preview phase, but will be charged based on the time it takes the tool to analyze a transcript and identify the intents once it is generally available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws-reinvent-2021/">re:Invent conference</a>, AWS today rolled out a slew of new features for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SageMaker,</a> the company&#8217;s managed service for building, training and deploying machine learning (ML) models. Swami Sivasubramanian, the vice president of machine learning at Amazon, said the new features aim to make it easier for users to scale machine learning in their organizations.</p>
<p>Firstly, AWS launched a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SageMaker Ground Truth Plus</a> service that uses an expert workforce to deliver high-quality training datasets faster. SageMaker Ground Truth Plus uses a labeling workflow including machine learning techniques for active learning, pre-labeling and machine validation. The company says the new service reduces costs by up to 40% and doesn&#8217;t require users to have deep machine learning expertise. The service enables users to create training datasets without having to build labeling applications. It also allows you to manage the labeling workforce on your own. SageMaker Ground Truth Plus is currently available in Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>The company also rolled out a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-sagemaker-inference-recommender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SageMaker Inference Recommender</a> tool to help users choose the best available compute instance to deploy machine learning models for optimal performance and cost. AWS says the tool automatically selects the right compute instance type, instance count, container parameters and model optimizations. Amazon SageMaker Inference Recommender is generally available in all regions where SageMaker is available except the AWS China regions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, AWS released the preview of a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-sagemaker-serverless-inference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SageMaker Serverless Interface</a> option that allows users to easily deploy machine learning models for inference without having to configure or manage the underlying infrastructure. The new option is available in Northern Virginia, Ohio, Oregon, Ireland, Tokyo and Sydney.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of additive manufacturing is not immune from the SPAC craze. Desktop Metal, Shapeways, Markforged and Velo3D have all either completed or announced plans to go public through the process. Austin-based Essentium <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211201005494/en/Essentium-A-Disruptive-Advanced-Manufacturing-Ecosystem-Provider-to-Become-A-Public-Company-Through-Merger-with-Atlantic-Coastal-Acquisition-Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week highlighted plans</a> to add its name to the growing list, courtesy of a reverse merger with Atlantic Coastal Acquisition Corporation.</p>
<p>The deal would value the combined companies at $974 million, including $345 million in cash, courtesy of Atlantic Coastal. Essentium cites ongoing supply chain issues as a motivating factor in growing interest around additive manufacturing/3D printing.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcoOrNKCWTc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241681" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Fundamental deficits in our existing global supply chain models are being exacerbated by escalating obstacles such as trade imbalances and the global pandemic — all leading to protracted distribution bottlenecks,” CEO Blake Teipel said in a release. “Today’s announcement represents a major milestone in our efforts to provide long-term, sustainable solutions for a new manufacturing paradigm that can meet these global challenges head-on.”</p>
<p>We spoke to Teipel back in 2017, when Essentium detailed a plasma-based system that fuses together plastic 3D-printed material as it prints, resulting in a stronger object than the traditional FDM process. Essentium also utilizes a High Speed Extrusion process, one it claims is 5x to 15x faster than standard extrusion. The company’s existing clients include the U.S. DoD, Lockheed Martin and Ford.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in Q1 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.soundingboardinc.com/">Sounding Board</a>, which started as a platform to connect leaders to coaches through a marketplace, realized early in the pandemic that mentorship needs a refresh.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve always delivered coaching in this traditional services format,” said<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christineptao-leadership-coaching"> Christine Tao</a>, Sounding Board CEO and co-founder.” “Well, we&#8217;re not in the office anymore so we actually have to speak differently about how we&#8217;re developing our talent and our leaders.” The insight led to the launch of a software platform that let users not only connect with coaches, but also track goals on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241675 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241673" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/sounding-board-raises-cash-as-startups-wake-up-to-executive-coaching/">Now, nearly a year after landing a Series A</a> with this vision, Sounding Board has closed a<a href="https://www.soundingboardinc.com/"> $30 million Series B </a>led by Jazz Venture Partners, and joined by Gaingels as well as angel investors such as theBoardlist’s Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, Ancestry.com’s Deb Liu, Udemy’s Yvonne Chen and Engage VC’s Tammy Aguiloon. Previous investors in the company include Canaan Partner and Precursor Ventures.</p>
<p>The round also saw JAZZ Venture Partners’ John Spinale join the board, an addition to Sounding Boards’ all-female team (and all-female board). ‘The joke is that we actually had to add diversity to our board…a man,” Tao laughed.</p>
<p>The fundraise comes off of solid growth for Sounding Board, which touts that it has had sequential growth for the past seven quarters. While Tao wouldn’t share specifics on revenues, the company said revenue was in the ‘multi-millions’ in the past and annual bookings have increased more than 350% year over year. Looking at stickiness, Sounding Board claims that net revenue retention is over 200%, meaning that existing customers continue to pay for the platform as time goes on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.betterup.com/?hsLang=en">BetterUp</a>, one of Sounding Board’s largest competitors, has been<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/executive-coaching-for-employees-is-complicated-and-emotional/"> on a recent acquisition spree </a>that illustrates a similarly shifting focus on the software behind coaching. It bought Motive to help BetterUp clients understand the emotional context behind data that they already aggregate, through engagement surveys or polls. The unicorn also scooped up Impraise, which uses technology to help managers better support their direct reports, through real-time performance reviews and more seamless feedback channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tao thinks BetterUp’s growth has helped elevate the importance of executive training to investors, but still sees room for more leadership-focused services instead of a broad-based coaching tool. Over the last year, the co-founder said she’s seen a lot of solutions that are focused on helping individuals manage their capacity through supporting mental and emotional state (<a href="https://www.betterup.com/solutions/betterup-care?hsLang=en">i.e. BetterUp care</a>).</p>
<p>“But alongside that you actually also need to have real skills and capability to be able to manage and effectively communicate,” she said. Sounding Board is more interested in solving for the capability side of executive training, and for now, has no plans to focus on the mental health aspect of it. Of course this could cause competitors to win market share from Sounding Board if they offer both sides in a rich way. For now, Sounding Board’s customers don’t seem to mind.</p>
<p>“If you think about your company&#8217;s benefits [with mental health], it’s a bit more hands off… it’s kind of there and then you choose whether or not you opt into it but it’s really meant to be there for employees &#8221; she said. “Whereas I think for capability-building there is this business need, investment they want to mke, and a level of responsibility that they have.”</p>
<p>Sounding Board currently has 100 customers, including Plaid, Chime and Bill.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space startup <a href="https://www.phasefour.io/">Phase Four</a> will be rolling out the next generation of its Maxwell radio-frequency plasma propulsion system next year, which the company says offers key performance improvements to allow spacecraft using it a wider range of maneuverability in orbit.</p>
<p>In general, when moving a satellite around in the vacuum of space, one cares about two key performance metrics: thrust and “specific impulse” (ISP), a measure of the system’s efficiency in how much thrust it provides per unit of propellant.</p>
<p>These trade-offs are especially salient for small spacecraft manufacturers. Systems with high thrust require carrying a lot of fuel – a costly choice for a satellite that could be the size of a mini-fridge. But propulsion tech that offers high ISP isn’t ideal either, especially if the satellite is heading to space in a rideshare mission and must reach its final orbit on its own. Often, traditional electric thrusters maximize specific impulse but at the expense of thrust – so while the thruster could be very efficient, maneuvers can take months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241654" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Phase Four’s Maxwell thrusters have gotten rid of this trade-off, allowing customers to operate at a relatively high thrust mode or at a high ISP, explained CTO Umair Siddiqui. That means being able to perform both fast maneuvers when required or to enter a high ISP mode to save propellant.</p>
<p>The company introduced these innovations in its first product, the Maxwell Block 1 thruster. The new iteration of the Maxwell thruster, Maxwell Block 2, offers a performance improvement in these metrics of around 85%. “This is significant,” he said. “[An] 85% improvement in ISP or thrust means that much less propellant usage or that much less time you’re maneuvering in orbit.”</p>
<p>Phase Four’s Maxwell thrusters have a few other innovations as well. The traditional plasma thruster, called the Hall-effect thruster, generates thrust using cathode materials that are difficult to manufacture. The systems are also bulky, which isn’t ideal for many customers. To solve these problems, Phase Four’s thrusters use radio-frequency plasma sources, rather than a cathode and anode, to generate thrust. That means a smaller thruster that’s easier to manufacture and that can accept any gaseous propellant – not just expensive Hall-effect thruster propellants like xenon or krypton.</p>
<p>The aim is to maintain production runs of under four months for the Block 2, an approximate timeline that the company first hit with the Block 1 thruster. The ability to keep such a quick turnaround is due, in part, to the modular design of the products. The Maxwell engines use a “chassis” style that borrows, at least in philosophy, from the auto industry. “We can still use the same production line to fold in next generation developments, and that&#8217;s the requirement for the product,” Siddiqui said. “It’s a plasma thruster with manufacturability thought at the outset.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2015, has delivered ten Maxwell Block 1 systems to customers so far. This summer, Phase Four raised a $26 million Series B led by New Science Ventures LLC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its re:Invent conference, AWS today announced <a href="https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/">SageMaker Studio Lab</a>, a free service to help developers learn machine learning techniques and experiment with the technology. Studio Lab provides users with all of the basics to get started, including a JupyterLab IDE, model training on CPUs and GPUs and 15 GB of persistent storage.</p>
<p>In addition, Amazon also today launched the AWS AI &amp; ML Scholarship Program. The company is committing $10 million oer year to this program, which it runs in collaboration with Intel and Udacity. 2,000 students will receive Udacity Nanodegree scholarships through this program every year, in addition to mentorship from Amazon and Intel employees.</p>
<p>“The two initiatives we are announcing today are designed to open up educational opportunities in machine learning to make it more widely accessible to anyone who is interested in the technology,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President of Amazon Machine Learning at AWS. “Machine learning will be one of the most transformational technologies of this generation. If we are going to unlock the full potential of this technology to tackle some of the world’s most challenging problems, we need the best minds entering the field from all backgrounds and walks of life. We want to inspire and excite a diverse future workforce through this new scholarship program and break down the cost barriers that prevent many from getting started with machine learning.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241655" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>To get started with Studio Lab, developer can sign up for a free account, which needs to get approved before you can use the service. It&#8217;s unclear what the requirements for getting access are, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission at AWS is to make machine learning (ML) more accessible. Through many conversations over the past years, I learned about barriers that many ML beginners face,&#8221; AWS&#8217;s Antje Barth writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Existing ML environments are often too complex for beginners, or too limited to support modern ML experimentation. Beginners want to quickly start learning and not worry about spinning up infrastructure, configuring services, or implementing billing alarms to avoid going over budget. This emphasizes another barrier for many people: the need to provide billing and credit card information at sign-up.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the reasons artificial intelligence is such an interesting field is that pretty much no one knows what it might turn out to be good at. Two papers by leading labs published in the journal Nature today show that machine learning can be applied to tasks as technically demanding as protein generation and as abstract as pure mathematics.</p>
<p>The protein thing may not sound like much of a surprise given the recent commotion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/deepmind-puts-the-entire-human-proteome-online-as-folded-by-alphafold/">around AI&#8217;s facility</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/researchers-match-deepminds-alphafold2-protein-folding-power-with-faster-freely-available-model/">in protein folding</a>, as demonstrated by Google&#8217;s DeepMind and the University of Washington&#8217;s Baker Lab, not coincidentally also the ones who put out the papers we&#8217;re noting today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04184-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The study from the Baker Lab</a> shows that the model they created to understand how protein sequences are folded can be repurposed to essentially do the opposite: create a new sequence meeting certain parameters and which acts as expected when tested in vitro.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241241" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t necessarily obvious — you might have an AI that&#8217;s great at detecting boats in pictures but can&#8217;t draw one, for instance, or an AI that translates Polish to English but not vice versa. So the discovery that an AI built to interpret the structure of proteins can also make new ones is an important one.</p>
<p>There has already been some work done in this direction by various labs, such as <a href="https://blog.einstein.ai/progen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProGen</a> over at SalesForce Research. But Baker Lab&#8217;s RoseTTAFold and DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold are way out in front when it comes to accuracy in proteomic predictions, so it&#8217;s good to know the systems can turn their expertise to creative endeavors.</p>

<h2>AI abstractions</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeepMind captured the cover of Nature</a> with a paper showing that AI can aid mathematicians in complex and abstract tasks. The results won&#8217;t turn the math world on its head, but they are truly novel and truly due to the help of a machine learning model, something that has never happened before.</p>
<p>The idea here relies on the fact that mathematics is largely the study of relationships and patterns — as one thing increases, another decreases, say, or as the faces of a polyhedron increase, so too does the number of its vertices. Because these things happen according to systems, mathematicians can arrive at conjectures about the exact relationship between those things.</p>
<p>Some of these ideas are simple, like the trigonometry expressions we learned in grade school: It&#8217;s a fundamental quality of triangles that the sum of their internal angles adds up to 180 degrees, or that the sum of the squares of the shorter sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. But what about for a 900-sided polyhedron in 8-dimensional space? Could you find the equivalent of a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> for that?</p>

<p>Mathematicians do, but there are limits to the amount of such work they can do, simply because one must evaluate many examples before one can be sure that a quality observed is universal and not coincidental. It is here, as a labor-saving method, that DeepMind deployed its AI model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Computers have always been good at spewing out data at a scale that humans can’t match but what is different [here] is the ability of AI to pick out patterns in the data that would have been impossible to detect on a human scale,&#8221; explained Oxford professor of mathematics Marcus du Sautoy in the DeepMind news release.</p>
<p>Now, the actual accomplishments made with the help of this AI system are miles above my head, but the mathematicians among our readers will surely understand the following, quoted from DeepMind:</p>
<blockquote><p>Defying progress for nearly 40 years, the combinatorial invariance conjecture states that a relationship should exist between certain directed graphs and polynomials. Using ML techniques, we were able to gain confidence that such a relationship does indeed exist and to hypothesize that it might be related to structures known as broken dihedral intervals and extremal reflections. With this knowledge, Professor Williamson was able to conjecture a surprising and beautiful algorithm that would solve the combinatorial invariance conjecture.</p>
<p>Algebra, geometry, and quantum theory all share unique perspectives on [knots] and a long standing mystery is how these different branches relate: for example, what does the geometry of the knot tell us about the algebra? We trained an ML model to discover such a pattern and surprisingly, this revealed that a particular algebraic quantity — the signature — was directly related to the geometry of the knot, which was not previously known or suggested by existing theory. By using attribution techniques from machine learning, we guided Professor Lackenby to discover a new quantity, which we call the natural slope, that hints at an important aspect of structure overlooked until now.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conjectures were borne out with millions of examples — another advantage of computation, that you can tell it to rigorously test your hypothesis without buying it pizza and coffee.</p>
<p>The DeepMind researchers and the professors mentioned above worked closely together to come up with these specific applications, so we&#8217;re not looking at a &#8220;universal pure math helper&#8221; or anything like that. But as Ruhr University Bochum&#8217;s Christian Stump notes in the Nature summary of the article, that it works at all is an important step toward such an idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither result is necessarily out of reach for researchers in these areas, but both provide genuine insights that had not previously been found by specialists. The advance is therefore more than the outline of an abstract framework,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Whether or not such an approach is widely applicable is yet to be determined, but Davies et al. provide a promising demonstration of how machine-learning tools can be used to support the creative process of mathematical research.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years ago at AWS re:Invent, then AWS CEO Andy Jassy made it clear that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/aws-is-sick-of-waiting-for-your-company-to-move-to-the-cloud/">he was tired of the slow pace of change</a> and he wanted to find ways to get companies to move to the cloud faster. At yesterday&#8217;s opening keynote, in fact, new AWS CEO Adam Selipsky stated that the pace is still pretty pokey with only between 5 and 15 percent of workloads having moved to the cloud thus far.</p>
<p>Part of the problem for the slow pace of change is that in spite of the recognized advantages of moving to the cloud, migrating data from on-premises to the cloud is a labor-intensive task, and it&#8217;s not easy to get your data from your on-prem legacy database to a shiny new cloud database.</p>
<p>Companies with multiple types of databases face an even bigger challenges when it comes to moving that data to the cloud and finding the right database service to match up with whatever you have been using on prem. Amazon recognized all of this and wanted to make it easier for customers to move to the cloud.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241617" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, the company introduced AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) Fleet Advisor, a tool specifically designed to help make it easier and faster to get your data to the cloud and match it with the correct database service.</p>
<p>&#8220;DMS Fleet Advisor automatically builds an inventory of your on-prem database and analytics service by streaming data from on prem to Amazon S3. From there, we take it over. We analyze [the data] to match it with the appropriate amount of AWS Datastore and then provide customized migration plans. All of this now just takes hours instead of what used to be weeks or months,&#8221; Swami Sivasubramanian, VP for Amazon AI told the AWS re:Invent audience at the AI and machine learning keynote today.</p>
<p>Sivasubramanian pointed out that this approach is not only faster, it&#8217;s also cheaper because you no longer have to rely on a third-party consultant to move the data for you. &#8220;This is going to make it a lot easier for you to modernize your data infrastructure with powerful relational and purposeful databases,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijay-menon-0b87b141/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vijay Menon</a>, a statistician by trade, began his career at Microsoft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was there that he realized there was an astounding number of subscriptions that failed to renew or even go through to begin with due to payment-related issues. He became intrigued by the problem, and solving it. Ultimately in 2016 alone, he helped the company recover over 10 million Xbox Live subscriptions, which resulted in over $100 million in recovered revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his subsequent roles at Dropbox and Scribd, Menon realized the problem of accidental payment churn was not exclusive to Microsoft. It was a challenge that plagued all B2B subscription and SaaS businesses.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241578" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every subscription company deals with this black hole,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment failure, in fact, is the among the biggest causes of customer churn and represents nearly half of all subscription churn. Even more alarming, Menon came to understand, the companies weren’t even aware of what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">False declines are estimated to be a $443 billion problem by the end of this year, according to </span><a href="https://www.cardinalcommerce.com/content-hub/industry-news/false-declines-heres-the-true-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardinal Commerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), resulting in millions of lost subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accidental churn is often not just due to problems with renewals, where people get frustrated by failed attempts to charge their credit card, for example. It is also largely a problem at the sign-up process, especially in countries outside the U.S., where charges are often falsely declined due to being attempted in another country. To Menon, it was a massive market severely underserved by traditional payment service providers such as Stripe who are strong domestically, but in his view, were poor at clearing international payments in growing markets like Brazil, India and Mexico. Menon estimates that on average, 4% of subscription customers are lost monthly to legitimate payments failing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers outside the U.S. might be clicking submit on a given transaction, but if they&#8217;re using a card form that&#8217;s configured for the U.S., they could be getting rejected, and “no one&#8217;s really checking on what happens after the user drops off,” Menon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2020, he teamed up with venture studio Atomic to found </span><a href="https://www.butterpayments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup aimed at helping companies retain existing customers and sign on new ones by preventing this accidental payment churn. Using machine learning, Butter aims to end the churn by preventing drop-off from legitimate payments.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9XzM6KQFdt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/talking-atomic/">Atomic has launched 14 startups in the last 12 months (and they&#8217;re getting funded); here&#8217;s how it works</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Atomic has launched 14 startups in the last 12 months (and they&#8217;re getting funded); here&#8217;s how it works&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/talking-atomic/embed/#?secret=9XzM6KQFdt" data-secret="9XzM6KQFdt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We focus on two problems that can affect any subscription business, which is basically ‘how do I check out a payment upfront and make sure that payment actually goes through?,’ ” Menon told TechCrunch. “The other part is, what do we do when a payment fails?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based startup has raised $7 million, largely from Atomic, to tackle the problem. In a year’s time, it has also signed on about a dozen consumer subscription companies, including some large names (which he declined to reveal publicly), doing $10 million to $500 million in revenue &#8212; many of which have an international user base. It claims that it helps these companies find, on average, $1 million of revenue per year.</span></p>
<p>Its revenue-sharing model is designed to align incentives with those of its customers. It charges a percentage of what it saves for its customers. For example, Menon estimates that a $100 million ARR company would be able to see $1 to $4 million in ARR lift which is a lot, and a $500 million ARR company, around $2.5 to $5 million.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An economy increasingly reliant on subscription models places new challenges on existing payment systems that are typically out of date, complicated, vary by country and constantly changing based on new fraud rules, according to Menon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even massive companies like Netflix and Spotify who have invested significant internal resources &#8211; payments engineering teams &#8211; in this problem, struggle because the payment landscape changes so frequently,” Menon told TechCrunch. “The Butter payments intelligence platform was built to scout through obscure payments networks to find what is broken.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butter plans to use its new capital to do “top of the funnel optimization,” according to Menon. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a consumer checks out, there are about 128 different data elements that can be presented with every payload, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re investing into the capabilities that will be able to make decisions [around those elements] in real time so that these folks coming in through the funnel will have a much higher likelihood of that payment going through,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long term, he said, the company aims to build an AWS, or operating system, for payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trying to build a connective tissue for the entire payments ecosystem. We sit above what we call the payment service providers so we’re not Stripe, we’re not Braintree, we’re sitting above them,” Menon explained. “We want to work with any company, regardless of what your payments stack is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also, naturally, plans to do more hiring. Recently, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billhoppin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Hoppin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined the company as a co-founder and COO. Butter expects to have about 50 employees by the end of Q1 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Abraham, CEO and managing partner of Atomic, described Menon as an “exceptional” founder with unique firsthand experience inside the payments systems of some of the largest global consumer subscription businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We co-founded Butter with Vijay and the team to solve some of the most critical conversion and churn issues that all businesses face, large or small, and a short time in the company is off to an incredible start,” he wrote via-email.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AWS today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-devops-guru-for-rds-to-detect-diagnose-and-resolve-amazon-aurora-related-issues-using-ml/">announced</a> a new service that makes it easier for its users to detect, diagnose and resolve issues in their relational databases. DevOps Guru for RDS, AWS&#8217;s fully managed relational database platform, is part of AWS&#8217;s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/">DevOps Guru</a> family, which launched last year with a service for detecting issues with machine learning services.</p>
<p>As Swami Sivasubramanian, VP, Amazon AI, argued in his keynote today, being good at managing databases is not a differentiating factor for most businesses, so a lot of them naturally gravitate toward managed services in the cloud. But even so, these customers would still like to see more automation tools for managing these services, especially around diagnosing performance issues, Sivasubramanian noted.</p>

<p>DevOps Guru for RDS helps these users detect issues when performance metrics spike for some reason. The service looks at the activity in the database and flags anything unusual. But what&#8217;s probably most important is that the service then also performs a root cause analysis to recommend changes and &#8212; whenever possible &#8212; it will even automatically remediate issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dating app giant Match has settled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/tinder-match-lawsuit/">lawsuit</a> with a group of Tinder founders and executives for $441 million. The suit, filed in 2018, <a href="https://www.tindercase.com/">had alleged</a> that IAC and its then-subsidiary Match Group had manipulated financial data in order to create a false, &#8220;lowball valuation&#8221; of the dating app when Tinder was merged into IAC in 2017. The employees also said they had been unlawfully stripped of their Tinder stock options. The suit had sought &#8220;billions of dollars&#8221; in damages at the time of its filing.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the case included Tinder&#8217;s co-founders Sean Rad, Justin Mateen and Jonathan Badeen, as well as  James Kim, the vice president of finance, and Rosette Pambakian, the vice president of marketing and communications.</p>
<p>Match, naturally, had dismissed the allegations as &#8220;meritless,&#8221; noting that Tinder&#8217;s valuation had been determined in a contractually-defined valuation process that involved two independent global banks. It had vowed to vigorously defend itself against the allegations in court.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the case proceeded, the court dismissed some of the plaintiffs&#8217; claims, like those that alleged the merger was not lawful, that product releases were wrongfully delayed, and those requesting damages for wrongful contract beyond breach of contract.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000891103/000089110321000093/mtch-20211201.htm">an SEC filing</a> published today, Match Group announced its settlement agreement. The company has agreed to pay the plaintiffs $441 million and in return, the plaintiffs will dismiss all claims on trial and in arbitration related to the 2017 Tinder valuation. Match Group said it will pay the settlement from cash on hand. The company had about $510 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the third quarter, <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Match+Group+%28MTCH%29+Tinder+Settlement+Removes+Major+Overhang+-+Truist/19294670.html">per</a> Truist analyst Youssef Squali. (The quarterly <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/279430125/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/ef9ecaab-bd08-4a79-b068-a216debc0c02.pdf">filing</a> shows $511.3 million as of Sept. 30).</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement also offered a media statement from the parties, which read: &#8220;The parties are pleased to announce that they have settled the valuation lawsuit presently on trial in New York Supreme Court and the related valuation arbitration.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the settlement didn&#8217;t result in the billions in damages that the plaintiffs had originally wanted, $441 million is not exactly a small number &#8212; especially for a case that Match had repeatedly dismissed as &#8220;meritless.&#8221; However, going to trial can also be expensive for a company and this suit has been hanging over Match&#8217;s head for years, costing tens of millions of dollars, Squali noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is deepening its commitment to operate a vertically integrated battery supply chain with the announcement that it would form a joint venture with South Korea-based POSCO Chemical to build a new cathode active material facility in North America by 2024.</p>
<p>Cathode active materials comprise around 40% of the cost of electric vehicle batteries, and the majority of both cathodes and anodes (the other building block of lithium-ion batteries) are produced in China, according to <a href="https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/china-controls-sway-of-electric-vehicle-power-through-battery-chemicals-cathode-and-anode-production/">Benchmark Mineral Intelligence</a>. This latest announcement brings the automaker one step closer to its goal of moving the majority of its battery production footprint to North America by 2025 &#8212; a huge geographical shakeup compared to where the battery supply chain exists today.</p>
<p>“We need to control our own destiny, especially when it comes to battery production,” GM executive Doug Parks said in a call with reporters Wednesday. “That’s why we’re pursuing a North America-focused vertical integration strategy for our proprietary platform.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241556" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>GM has already aggressively pursued control of the remainder of the battery supply chain, including battery cell production with Ultium, its JV with LG Energy Solution, and its battery recycling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/gm-and-lg-chems-ultium-cells-partners-with-li-cycle-to-process-manufacturing-waste/">agreement with Li-Cycle</a>. The materials from this facility will go straight into the production of new Ultium battery cells &#8212; a nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum (NCMA) battery that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">forms the bedrock</a> of the automaker’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion electrification strategy</a>.</p>
<p>While company executives declined to specify where the plant will be located or the size of the investment, it’s almost certain to be significant. That’s because the materials produced by the new facility will supply “most” of the cathode active material needed for all four of the battery manufacturing facilities GM has planned under its Ultium JV. That will eventually bring the automaker to a total of 140 gigawatt-hours of cell manufacturing capacity in the United States.</p>
<p>The joint venture will have to move quickly if it wants the new facility to be up and running by 2024. The two companies said a site location could be announced as early as the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>GM’s vertical integration strategy comes amid the ongoing chip shortage, which continues to affect industries from auto to consumer electronics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“If anything, the semiconductor crisis has taught us that we need to have agility,” Parks said.</p>
<p>He added that moving more of the supply chain &#8212; including raw materials sourcing &#8212; to North America could help address some of the more painful realities of battery production, like human rights abuses in cobalt sourcing or environmental impacts.</p>
<p>“We think that the supply chain can be improved from what it is today, both from a security standpoint &#8212; a locational security, I&#8217;ll call that the North American approach &#8212; as well as environmental,” Parks said.</p>
