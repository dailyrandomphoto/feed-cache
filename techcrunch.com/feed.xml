										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emergency services continue to be a major force when it comes to coping with the Covid-19 health pandemic, and today a company that is building technology to help them run better is announcing a round of funding to continue expanding its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://carbyne911.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbyne</a> &#8212; an Israeli startup that has built a cloud-based platform aimed at emergency services to help them pinpoint more complete information about the people who are calling in, and to provide additional telemedicine services to start responding faster &#8212; has picked up $25 million.</p>
<p>The plan will be to take the service &#8212; which was already seeing strong growth before the pandemic &#8212; to the next level in terms of the technology it is building and the markets and organizations it is serving.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Carbyne was not founded last year: we were already pushing cloud services and video and location to 911 for quite a while and had served 250 million people before the pandemic,&#8221; said Amir Elichai, the CEO, in an interview. &#8220;But cloud solutions for emergency services went from nice to have to must have with Covid.&#8221; The company has partnerships with public health providers as well as with groups like CentralSquare and Global Medical Response (GMR), and says that in the U.S. it is on target to cover some 90% of the market.</p>
<p>The Series B1 is being led by Hanaco Ventures and ELSTED Capital Partners, with former CIA Director General David Petraeus, Founders Fund, FinTLV, and other past investors also participating.</p>
<p>The fact that this is a B1 round points to more funding on the way for the company in coming months. In any case, the $25 million is more than the company had planned to raise.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plan was to raise $15 million in 2020. After Covid started I decided we didn’t want to let anyone go, but we didn’t know what the situation would be. So we cut salaries instead across the board,&#8221; said Elichai. &#8220;But then we started to double revenues starting in Q2, and then in Q3 and Q4 grew 160%. It was straightforward to raise this money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is coming on the heels of very strong growth for the company, in particular in the last year.</p>
<p>Carbyne&#8217;s services now cover about 400 million people, with a new implementation launching every 10 days since March of last year.</p>
<p>Elichai, who co-founded the company with Alex Dizengoff (CTO) and Yony Yatsun (engineering lead), said in an interview that in the last nine months, Carbyne has provided some 155 million location points to emergency medical services teams. Newer products are also growing. The services for EMS teams to provide help remotely have racked up 1.3 million minutes of video in that time, he said.</p>
<p>From what we understand, the funding puts Carbyne&#8217;s valuation at over $100 million. Although Elichai declined to give a specific figure, for some context, the company was valued at &#8220;around&#8221; $100 million when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/carbyne-raises-15m-for-its-next-gen-911-service-as-founders-fund-invests-in-its-first-israeli-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last raised in 2018</a>, a $15 million round that marked the first time that Founders Fund had invested in an Israeli startup.</p>
<p>The growth of the last year, and the ongoing demands on the business, point to that &#8220;over&#8221; being strong. Indeed, since its last round, the world at large, and the startup itself, have undergone some significant changes.</p>
<p>2018 and whatever dramas we were experiencing back then now feel like a distant, almost halcyon?, past when compared to some of the crises of the moment. One in particular, the coronavirus pandemic, has a direct connection to Carbyne.</p>
<p>Covid-19, the illness the results from the virus, has proven to be a pernicious and dogged ailment, often hitting people with its most dire and serious symptoms &#8212; the inability to breathe and organ failure &#8212; just when they start to think that they might be recovering. (Of course, that&#8217;s not the case for everyone, thankfully, but still it happens much too often to ignore.)</p>
<p>That has put a huge strain on emergency response services, from those that are fielding initial callouts, through to those making first contact with patients, and those at the hospitals bringing in and caring for the most serious cases. In many cases, those working these services have been stretched to overcapacity. The situation in many cities is nothing short of dire.</p>
<p>Carbyne&#8217;s technology has come into its own as a way not just to help those people do their jobs better by providing them with more data, but by becoming a means to those services channelling data back to those people calling in.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, the company has undergone some significant shifts in how it delivers its services: when I covered the startup&#8217;s last funding round in 2018, for example, it provided some services directly to EMS organizations, but mainly it needed users to install an app, or provide that technology through another app, in order to work. Now, Elichai says that the company has integrated some location services from companies like Google to remove the need to use an app to connect users to its platform.</p>
<p>Similarly, the startup has taken a strong lead in how it collaborates with municipalities not just to provide services to make their operations more efficient, but to help offset them getting overwhelmed. A project in that vein was a <a href="https://carbyne911.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GT20_CASE_STUDY_AWS_JPS_v.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent undertaking in New Orleans</a>, which Elichai said played a part in helping the city from really buckling under and managing the Covid-19 outbreak. More on that here:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rvc4pjPR1AY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Longer term, in countries like the US and elsewhere, there is a strong argument to be made for a lot of legacy services in 911-style emergency response finally getting the updates they have needed for years.</p>
<p class="p1">Specifically, earlier this month, a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill approved in Congress earmarks $12 billion in funding for next-generation 911 deployments.</p>
<p>Carbyne believes that by 2023, it will be serving some 1.5 billion people, and it&#8217;s moves like this in the U.S. that point to why that might not be so far-fetched, Covid-19 or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://x1creditcard.com">X1 Card</a> is raising a $12 million funding round. The company is building a credit card that sets limits based on your current and future income, not your credit score.</p>
<p>Spark Capital is leading the round with Jared Leto, Aaron Levie, Jeremy Stoppelman, Max Levchin and Ali Rowghani also participating. American Express veteran Ash Gupta is also joining the company as an advisor —&nbsp;he was the Chief Risk Officer of American Express.</p>
<p>The company says that it has attracted nearly 300,000 signups on its waitlist. I covered X1 Card <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/x1-card-is-a-credit-card-based-on-your-income-not-your-credit-score/">back in September</a> and it attracted a lot of readers. So that number doesn’t surprise me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The X1 Card is a stainless steel Visa credit card with a different origin story. When you apply for a card, instead of determining your limits based on your credit score, the company wants to see your current and future income.</p>
<p>The startup believes the credit score system is outdated and doesn’t reflect your creditworthiness. That’s why it doesn’t use it to calculate limits. Your credit score still affects your variable APR (from 12.9% to 19.9%), but that’s it.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of software features that work with the credit card. For instance, you can track your subscriptions from the X1 app, you can also generate an auto-expiring virtual card for free trials that require a credit card. You also get notifications for refunds.</p>
<p>As for rewards, you get 2X points on all purchases. If you’re a heavy user and you spend more than $15,000 on your card per year, you’re upgraded to a new tier and earn 3X points. There’s also a viral element as you get a boosted reward level when you refer a friend —&nbsp;you get 4X points for a month. You can then spend your points with retail partners.</p>
<p>The company has promised a lot of features and now has enough cash in its bank account to deliver. Let’s see if the company can live up to the hype once the first customers get their cards. But it’s clear that the credit score system is outdated.</p>

<p>Blue Origin is launching its New Shepard suborbital rocket for the first time in 2021, with a liftoff planned for 9:45 AM CST (10:45 AM EST/7:45 AM PST) from its launch facility in West Texas. This is the 14th flight of New Shepard, and it includes some key testing activities for Blue Origin in preparation for its first human spaceflight missions.</p>
<p>The company has been flying a crew capsule on board its rocket for quite a while now, albeit empty (or rather, loaded with scientific and other cargo, rather than people). This version includes some key systems that will be used when astronauts are inside, however, including communications systems, and cabin environment regulation technologies that will make the trip for private spacefarers more comfortable and safe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Blue Origin has had 13 previous successful New Shepard launches before, so one can reasonably expect things to go well today. But the company&#8217;s focus on that crew cabin and gathering data around systems crucial to human spaceflight is an exciting indicator that people could be on board that spacecraft sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The stream above will being 30 minutes before the liftoff time, so at around 10:15 AM EST/7:15 AM PST.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency exchange company <a href="https://www.gemini.com/">Gemini</a> is acquiring <a href="https://www.blockrize.com/">Blockrize</a> and announcing a new product today based on Blockrize’s work. Later this year, the company is launching a credit card that works like a regular credit card — but you earn bitcoin rewards based on your purchases.</p>
<p>The credit card will work on the Visa network and will be available in the U.S. Customers will earn up to 3% in bitcoin rewards (again, <em>up to</em> 3%). You&#39;ll be able to earn other crypto assets as well. Those rewards will be deposited on your Gemini account.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the first time a company is announcing a credit card with bitcoin rewards. BlockFi already announced its own card <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-announces-early-2021-launch-for-bitcoin-rewards-credit-card">back in December</a>. Both companies have yet to launch their cards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a comparison, BlockFi promises 1.5% rewards on fiat purchases. There&#39;s a $200 annual fee but you get $250 back if you spend at least $3,000 with the card in the first three months.</p>
<p>This new category of credit cards could be interesting for people who want to slowly acquire cryptocurrencies without going through an exchange. Similarly, some crypto enthusiasts don&#39;t want to use a debit card tied to a cryptocurrency wallet as they don&#39;t want to spend their crypto assets — HODL, as they say.</p>
<p>You could consider those credit cards as an alternative to credit cards that give you cashback. Sure, you don&#39;t get points that you can exchange for perks. But you get crypto assets without having to think about it.</p>
<p>Gemini customers can sign up to the <a href="https://gemini.com/credit-card/waitlist">waitlist</a> today. Blockrize has been working on a credit card for some time. While it is now part of Gemini, people who previously signed up to Blockrize’s waitlist are still on the waitlist.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors in the round included George Kurtz, the president and chief executive of CrowdStrike, and George Roberts, a partner at OpenView Venture Partners and the former executive vice president of North American sales at Oracle.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Value Management [sic] as a practice is now a C-suite priority and increasingly considered an enterprise-critical function alongside software systems like CRM, marketing automation, and project management,” said Sameer Gandhi, Partner, Accel, in a statement. “In 2019, we invested in a SAFE round in DecisionLink because we believed in the market opportunity for scalable [value management]. Now, we have been so impressed by DecisionLink’s execution and its ability to drive this transformation on behalf of customers, that we are excited to lead its Series A round.”</p>
<p>Businesses are constantly looking for ways to benchmark themselves against their competitors or find new ways to better service them. Most of these strategies don&#8217;t take off, or are variations on a theme, but value management seems to have legs &#8212; especially given the accessibility of all kinds of benchmarking data points that are publicly available.</p>
<p>Accel-backed portfolio companies like CrowdStrike, PagerDuty, and DocuSign are using the service and so are companies like ServiceNow, Marketo, NCR, and VMWare.</p>
<p>These are big names in enterprise software, and the signal that their adoption of DecisionLink&#8217;s software provided must have played a role in Accel&#8217;s decision to invest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s use of dark patterns that add friction to the process of terminating a Prime subscription is being targeted by 16 consumer rights groups in Europe and the US which are taking coordinated action to urge regulatory intervention.</p>
<p>One of them &#8212; Norway&#8217;s Consumer Council (NCC) &#8212; has also published a <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-14-you-can-log-out-but-you-can-never-leave-final.pdf">report</a> calling out what it describes as <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the ecommerce giant&#8217;s </span>&#8220;manipulative&#8221; and &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">unreasonably cumbersome&#8221; unsubscribe process for Prime. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The report has been punningly titled &#8216;<a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-14-you-can-log-out-but-you-can-never-leave-final.pdf">You can log out, but you can never leave</a>&#8216;.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It should be as easy to end a subscription as it was to subscribe in the first place. Amazon should facilitate a good user experience instead of hindering customers and tricking them into continuing paid services they do not need or want,&#8221; said NCC director of digital policy, Finn Lützow-Holm Myrstad, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In our view, this practice not only betrays the expectations and trust of consumers but breaches European law,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Prime subscription is a key tool in Amazon&#8217;s arsenal, generating reliably recurring revenue while simultaneously encouraging users to lock themselves in to making additional purchases via the carrot of unlimited &#8216;free&#8217; fast shipping (which applies to a subset of qualifying items on the marketplace). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Other perks Amazon throws in to juice Prime membership include streaming movies, TV shows, music and games, plus exclusive shopping programs and discounts (though the exact bundle varies by market).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">However a lock-in vibe also applies when trying to end a Prime subscription, per the complaints, because Amazon requires users to successfully navigate multiple menus, select from confusingly worded multiple-choice options and scroll past various distracting and/or irrelevant interstitials and dead space in order to locate the button that actually ends their subscription.  </span></p>
<p>And, don&#8217;t forget, this is the same company that famously patented a &#8216;1-click&#8217; button for consumers&#8217; cash to pour into its coffers&#8230;</p>
<p>The NCC has made the below video illustrating the various dark patterns Amazon deploys to try to nudge Prime subscribers away from unsubscribing &#8212; including a cartoon of a dog barking because, uh, we have no idea tbh&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpEQ4OWNO4Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Complaints against Amazon&#8217;s click-heavy process for Prime unsubscribing are being filed by consumer groups in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Switzerland and Norway and the US &#8212; so a variety of national and regional consumer protection laws are involved.</p>
<p>The NCC&#8217;s <a href="https://fil.forbrukerradet.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/complaint-against-amazon-prime.pdf">complaint</a>, for example, makes reference to Norway&#8217;s Marketing Control Act &#8212; which implements the EU&#8217;s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive &#8212; providing a framework for &#8220;what marketing, commercial practices and terms of service the service providers are allowed to use in different markets&#8221;, as it explains in the complaint.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Marketing Control Act section 6 implements the general clause in Article 5 of the Directive which states that an unfair commercial practice is banned. What constitutes an unfair commercial practice is defined in the second paragraph of section 6, which states that a commercial practice is unfair if it breaches &#8216;good business practices&#8217; toward consumers, and is able to significantly alter a consumer’s financial conduct, so that the consumer makes a decision that they would not otherwise have made,&#8221; the NCC argues.</p>
<p>Some of the coordinated complaints will be less formal, taking the form of letters written to consumer protection agencies urging them to investigate. In the US, for example, the FTC will be urged to &#8220;investigate Amazon’s practices and analyze whether they violate Section 5 of the FTC Act&#8221;.</p>
<p>While in Germany the VZBV consumer protection agency told us it&#8217;s currently assessing Amazon&#8217;s cancellation process for Prime &#8212; which it noted &#8220;looks a bit different&#8221; to the one in the Norwegian complaints &#8212; saying it&#8217;s not yet clear whether or not it will file a court injunction over the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike the other consumer organisations taking part in this concerted action, we’re not sending complaints to authorities,&#8221; the VZBV spokesperson added. &#8220;My employer, the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzbv) is able to send legal warnings and, if demands to cease and desist are not being met, sue companies infringing consumer protection laws in its own capacity. We will do so if there is enough legal merit to this case. But as I said, it is not completely decided yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>We contacted Amazon for comment on the complaints against the Prime unsubscribe process and it denied making it unclear and difficult for members to cancel their subscription, arguing that it only takes &#8220;a few clicks&#8221; online or &#8220;a quick phone call&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s its full statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon makes it clear and easy for Prime members to cancel their subscription at any time, whether through a few clicks online, a quick phone call or by turning off auto renew in their membership options. Customer trust is at the heart of all of our products and services and we reject the claim that our cancellation process is unfair or creates uncertainty. We take great pride in the Prime service and the number of ways it makes our members lives easier, but we make it easy for customers to leave whenever they choose to. The information we provide in the online cancellation flow gives a full view of the benefits and services members are cancelling.</p></blockquote>
<p>Consumer groups banding together to apply pressure on tech giants to change dubious practices is not a new phenomenon. Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/google-faces-gdpr-complaint-over-deceptive-location-tracking/">2018</a>, for example, a number of European groups coordinated complaints against Google&#8217;s &#8216;deceptive&#8217; harvesting of location data. Just under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/googles-location-tracking-finally-under-formal-probe-in-europe/">a year ago</a> the Irish Data Protection Commission opened a formal investigation &#8212; which remains ongoing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.upgrade.com">Upgrade</a> has been positioning itself as a neobank. And yet, the company has mostly been focused on personal loans and more recently credit cards. You couldn&#8217;t just replace your bank account with Upgrade. Upgrade is adding two important missing pieces of the puzzle with <a href="https://www.upgrade.com/rewards-checking/">checking accounts and debit cards</a>.</p>
<p>With today’s launch, Upgrade competes more directly with other challenger banks, such as <a href="https://www.chime.com">Chime</a>, <a href="https://n26.com">N26</a> and others. You can open a checking account, control it from a mobile app, send and receive money from that account.</p>
<p>There are no monthly fees and no minimum account balance. Under the hood, Cross River Bank provides FDIC-insured checking accounts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You also get a debit card with your checking account. When it comes to ATM withdrawals, Upgrade will reimburse ATM fees for its most loyal customers up to five times a month. You need to maintain a minimum balance or set up direct payroll deposit for that feature.</p>
<p>Debit card payments on subscriptions and common everyday expenses let you earn 2% cash back. Eligible purchases include convenience stores, gas stations, restaurants, food deliveries, etc. Your earn 1% on other debit charges.</p>
<p>Rewards on debit card transactions are somewhat uncommon. Most financial companies focus on credit card rewards as the interchange fees on credit card transactions are much higher. Debit cards don’t generate as much interchange revenue.</p>
<p>“Neobanks in particular cannot pay high rewards (or any rewards at all) on debit cards because the interchange fee is often their only source of revenue,” Upgrade CEO Renaud Laplanche told me in an email.</p>
<p>And interchange fees can add up if you manage to attract millions of customers. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-14-5-billion-chime-proved-silicon-valley-investors-wrong">According to The Information</a>, Chime generated more than $600 million in revenue last year thanks to interchange fees.</p>
<p>The company still plans to generate the vast majority of its revenue from credit products. “Our strategy is to monetize our base through credit,” Laplanche said.</p>
<p>Upgrade also offers a credit card with 1.5% cash back on all purchases. If, for one reason or another, you can’t pay your monthly balance payment, the company helps you combine monthly charges into installment plans that you can pay back over 24 to 60 months. You pay down your balance at a fixed rate with equal monthly payments. Upgrade customers who use the company’s checking account will get lower rates on Upgrade loans.</p>
<p>You can also get a personal loan from Upgrade without a credit card or a checking account. And maybe you’ll end up discovering Upgrade’s other products after signing up to a personal loan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tresl.co/">Tresl</a>’s flagship product, e-commerce intelligence platform Segment Analytics, is designed to give small brands on Shopify access to the same kind of analytics larger online retailers have. Founded by former LinkedIn data scientists, Tresl is <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/2a93c8ef-f501-491b-9d88-86cea40f4dc7?index=1">currently exhibiting at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena</a>.</p>
<p>Segments Analytics analyzes a Shopify store’s data and then automatically sorts visitors into more 30 pre-built customer segments based on their browsing habits, spending and how likely they are to make repeat purchases.</p>
<p>This means that brands can identify specific groups of shoppers and use Segments Analytics&#8217; suggestions for targeted campaigns without spending too much on data analytics, marketing or user acquisition. For example, one of the segments the platform identifies are people who have made one purchase already, but are unlikely to buy again unless they are see an ad or promotion soon. Segments Analytics can be used for advertising across multiple channels, including email, Facebook and Google.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tresl claims that brands using Segments Analytics have increased their clickthrough rates on abandoned cart flows (or reminders sent to customers who have unpurchased items) by 30% and grown sales by 40% month-over-month within one month of implementing the platform.</p>
<p>Segments Analytics is currently available through the Shopify App Store, with subscriptions starting from $79 a month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.3drens.com/">3Drens</a>’ IoT mobility management platform not only lets fleet operators track where their vehicles are, but also produces data that helps them make business decisions. The company began operating in Taiwan, where it is based, before expanding into Southeast Asia. Currently <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/2befd832-75d3-4057-adaa-29a67d822747?index=1">presenting at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena</a>, 3Drens is focused on the increased demand for logistics during COVID-19. For example, its tech can potentially be used to enable smaller e-commerce retailers to rent unused capacity on delivery vehicles from larger platforms.</p>
<p class="p1">The company’s clients also come from the vehicle rental, ride-hailing and food delivery sectors. Founded in 2017, one of 3rens’ first clients was a electric scooter company that mostly serves tourists. It installed 3Drens’ IoT box onto scooters to send alerts if scooters were potentially involved in accidents or if a user went over the time they had paid for. It also generated a heat map of where the scooters traveled the most often, so the company was able to make partnerships with popular venues and attractions.</p>
<p class="p1">3Drens’ platform can also help logistics services pick the right type of vehicle for a delivery, predict the best routes and assign new tasks for drivers on their way back after an order is fulfilled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.oflo.io/">OFLO</a> is a voice communication system designed to replace traditional walkie talkies. Its hardware is more compact and lightweight, with a bone conduction headset, and capable of covering unlimited distances and multiple channels. Created by Origami Labs, OFLO is also connected to software that features auto logging and productivity tools for teams who don’t have access to screens while they are working.</p>
<p>The startup, whose clients include property management company JLL and luxury hotel chain The Peninsula, is currently <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/4156af83-7ac4-45f4-9716-3120e13bb1ed?index=1">showcasing OFLO</a> at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion.</p>
<p>OFLO was created for the millions of frontline workers in health care, hospitality, security, manufacturing and other sectors who can’t sit in front of a computer or look down at mobile screens frequently. The walkie talkies many of them currently use cover only limited distances and have a single channel that is shared by multiple workers. OFLO’s advantages include letting users call specific co-workers and it is also cross-platform, so someone talking on a smartphone can call a person on a OFLO walkie talkie. Its software includes features like live chats, transcriptions, task management and GPS location.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>OFLO is available on a subscription plan for $6 per user a month. Wong said its monthly recurring revenue is currently increasing 20% a month, with a target of $100,000 a month by the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The system builds on Origami Labs’ other tech, including <a href="https://orii.io">Orii</a>, a voice-powered ring. Co-founder and chief executive officer Kevin Johan Wong told TechCrunch the company sees OFLO as &#8220;almost a screenless smartphone alternative.&#8221; One of the reasons Wong became interested in working on voice technology is because his father, Peter Wong, is a visually-impaired programmer who helped develop Microsoft’s accessibility tools.</p>
<p>“Our company’s mantra is to try to create devices that are equalizing, that allow people to interact with computers screenless-ly,” said the younger Wong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the proliferation of subscription services, combined with our lives becoming almost 100% digital, there’s a rising need to be able to manage these services. But most banks don’t have much of an answer. Step in <a href="https://minnatechnologies.com/">Minna Technologies</a>, which sells in its subscription management services into banking apps.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $18.8 million (€15.5m / £14m) in Series B fundraising from Element Ventures, MiddleGame Ventures, Nineyards Equity and Visa, to expand its open banking technology to banks globally.</p>
<p>Founded in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2016, Minna enables customers to manage subscription services via their existing bank’s app. Using Minna, customers can terminate subscriptions just from their banking app, automatically, cutting the data and financial ties between the merchant and customer. The platform can also notify customers when a free trial is about to end and facilitates utilities switching allowing them to find better deals. So far, Minna has partnerships with Lloyds Banking Group, Swedbank and ING.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Minna’s technology reduces the burden on a bank’s call centers, plus banks can also benefit financially from Minna’s role in facilitating utility switching, raising the prospect of banks becoming marketplaces.</p>
<p>The appearance of Minna suggests that the first wave of neo-banks is about to be accompanied by a second wave of overlayed services such as this. The average European is spending £301 (€333) a month on 11 subscriptions, which is predicted to increase to £459 (€508) a month on 17 subscriptions by 2025. IDC predicts that by 2050, 50% of the world’s largest enterprises will focus the majority of their businesses on digitally enhanced products, services, and experiences. Subscriptions are even coming from car makers such as Volvo.</p>
<p>Joakim Sjöblom, CEO and co-founder of Minna Technologies, said: “Over the past four years the subscription economy has exploded from Spotify and Netflix to even iPhones and cars. It&#8217;s becoming increasingly difficult for consumers to keep track of the payments and harder for banks to handle inquiries to shut them down. Minna’s tech improves the procedure for banks by simplifying the process, as well as providing an in-demand digital product that consumers are starting to expect from their financial institutions.”</p>
<p>Sjöblom told me that by largely working with incumbent banks, Minna is providing them with a way to fight back against challenger banks.</p>
<p>Pascal Bouvier, Managing Partner, MiddleGame Ventures said: “We strongly believe in a vision where banks develop their checking account offerings into “connected and intelligent” platforms and where retail clients are able to interact in many more ways than in the recent past.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google said on Thursday it has pulled some personal loan apps from Play Store in India and was implementing stronger measures to prevent abuse following reports that said several firms were targeting vulnerable borrowers in the country and then going to extreme lengths to recover their money.</p>
<p>The Android-maker said users and government agencies in India recently flagged several personal loan apps and the company reviewed hundreds of them. The review found an identified number of apps violated Play Store’s safety policies and they were immediately removed from the Store.</p>
<p>Google, whose Android operating system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/indian-startups-explore-forming-an-alliance-and-alternative-app-store-to-fight-googles-monopoly/">powers 98% smartphones in India</a>, said it has asked the developers of the remaining identified apps to demonstrate that their apps are in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations. (In an email reviewed by TechCrunch, Google had asked a developer to provide documentation within five days.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Apps that fail to do so will be removed without further notice. In addition, we will continue to assist the law enforcement agencies in their investigation of this issue,” the company said.</p>
<p>Users have identified several lending apps including 10MinuteLoan and Ex-Money in India in recent months that granted small ticket loans (typically in the range of $50 to $200) to people for short tenures without much verification to determine their eligibility and then <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-instant-loan-apps-drained-crores-from-borrowers/articleshow/80170284.cms">charged steep processing fees</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid such abuse, Google said Play Store will only allow personal apps that require customers to make their repayment in 60 days or longer.</p>
<p>When borrowers struggled to repay their debt in the short period, collection agents on behalf of some lending apps <a href="https://the-ken.com/story/indias-instant-loan-app-crisis-is-made-in-china/">among other ill tactics</a>, threatened to embarrass them in front of their friends, colleagues and family. In November, local newspaper Indian Express <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2020/nov/25/bullied-online-by-money-lending-app-company-chennai-man-kills-self-2227722.html">reported</a> that a 23-year-old man committed suicide after being bullied by a money lending app. It&#8217;s not the only reported suicide case linked to such harassment in recent months.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Local media also <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-instant-loan-apps-drained-crores-from-borrowers/articleshow/80170284.cms">reported</a> that police in the city of Hyderabad recently froze bank accounts holding $58 million for alleged scams conducted through 30 lending apps, none of which had approval from the nation&#8217;s central bank. A preliminary investigation found that these apps had processed nearly $2.9 billion through 14 million transactions.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/logic">Srikanth L</a> of CashlessConsumer, a consumer collective on digital payments, told TechCrunch that Google took too much time to turn its attention to this issue. Srikanth, who has been tracking online lending apps in India for several quarters, said more than 100 apps in the last 10 days and about 450 in recent months had disappeared from Google Play Store, citing his <a href="https://twitter.com/logic/status/1349679647340994562">own analysis</a>.</p>
<p>He also criticized Google for not doing enough to stop apps from gleaning a wide range of data from a customer&#8217;s Android phone. &#8220;They still don&#8217;t mandate these apps to disclose their website and physical address,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>“To protect user privacy, developers must only request permissions that are necessary to implement current features or services. They should not use permissions that give access to user or device data for undisclosed, unimplemented, or disallowed features or purposes,&#8221; wrote Suzanne Frey, Vice President, Product, Android Security and Privacy, <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/01/protecting-against-harmful-financial.html">in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developers must also only use data for purposes that the user has consented to, and if they later want to use the data for other purposes, they must obtain user permission for the additional uses,” she added.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s move comes months after Google stepped up its efforts to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/google-pulls-indias-paytm-app-from-play-store-for-repeat-policy-violations/">crack down on fantasy sports apps in India</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small enterprises remain one of the most underserved segments of the business market, but the growth of cloud-based services &#8212; easier to buy, easier to provision &#8212; has helped that change in recent years. Today, one of the more promising startups out of Europe building software to help SMEs run online businesses is announcing some funding to better tap into both the opportunity to build these services, and to meet a growing demand from the SME segment.</p>
<p><a href="https://xentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xentral</a>, a German startup that develops enterprise resource planning software covering a variety of back-office functions for the average online small business, has picked up a Series A of $20 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform today covers services like order and warehouse management, packaging, fulfillment, accounting and sales management, and the majority of its 1,000 customers are in Germany &#8212; they include the likes of direct-to-consumer brands like YFood, KoRo, the Nu Company and Flyeralarm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Benedikt Sauter, the co-founder and CEO of Xentral, said the ambition is to expand into the rest of Europe, and eventually other geographies, and to fold in more services to its ERP platform, such as a more powerful API to allow customers to integrate more services &#8212; for example in cases where a business might be selling on their own site, but also Amazon, eBay, social platforms and more &#8212; to bring their businesses to a wider market.</p>
<p>Mainly, he said, the startup wants &#8220;to build a better ecosystem to help our customers run their own businesses better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Sequoia Capital, with Visionaires Club (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/visionaries-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2B-focused VC out of Berlin</a>) also participating.</p>
<p>The deal is notable for being the prolific, high-profile VC&#8217;s first investment in Europe since officially opening for business in the region. (Sequoia has backed a number of startups in Europe before this, including Graphcore, Klarna, Tessian, Unity, UiPath, n8n and Evervault &#8212; but all of those deals were done from afar.)</p>
<p>Augsburg-based Xentral has been around as a startup since 2018, and &#8220;as a startup&#8221; is the operative phrase here.</p>
<p>Sauter and his co-founder Claudia Sauter (who is also his co-founder in life: she is his wife) built the early prototype for the service originally for themselves.</p>
<p>The pair were running a business of their own &#8212; a hardware company they founded in 2008, selling not nails, hammers and wood, but circuit boards they they designed, along with other hardware to build computers and other connected objects. Around 2013, as the business was starting to pick up steam, they decided that they really needed better tools to manage everything at the backend so that they would have more time to build their actual products.</p>
<p>But Bene Sauter quickly discovered a problem in the process: smaller businesses may have Shopify and its various competitors to help manage e-commerce at the front end, but when it came to the many parts of the process at the backend, there really wasn&#8217;t a single, easy solution (remember this was eight years ago, at a time before the Shopifys of the world were yet to expand into these kinds of tools). Being of a DIY and technical persuasion &#8212; Sauter had studied hardware engineering at university &#8212; he decided that he&#8217;d try to build the tools that he wanted to use himself.</p>
<p>The Sauters used those tools for for years, until without much outbound effort, they started to get a some inbound interest from other online businesses to use the software, too. That led to the Sauters balancing both their own hardware business and selling the software on the side, until around 2017/2018 when they decided to wind down the hardware operation and focus on the software full-time. And from then, Xentral was born. It now has, in addition to 1,000 customers, some 65 employees working on developing the platform.</p>
<p>The focus with Xentral is to have a platform that is easy to implement and use, regardless of what kind of SME you might be as long as you are selling online. But even so, Sauter pointed out that the other common thread is that you need at least one person at the business who champions and understands the value of ERP. &#8220;It&#8217;s really a mindset,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The challenge with Xentral in that regard will be to see how and if they can bring more businesses to the table and tap into the kinds of tools that it provides, at the same time that a number of other players also eye up the same market. (Others in the same general category of building ERP for small businesses include online payments provider Sage, Netsuite and Acumatica.) ERP overall is <a href="https://www.marketresearchengine.com/reportdetails/erp-enterprise-resource-planning-software-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forecast</a> to become a $49.5 billion market by 2025.</p>
<p>Sequoia and its new partner in Europe Luciana Lixandru &#8212; who is joining Xentral&#8217;s board along with Luciana Lixandru and Visionaries’ Robert Lacher &#8212; believe however that there remains a golden opportunity to build a new kind of provider from the ground up and out of Europe specifically to target the opportunity in that region.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see Xentral becoming the <em>de facto</em> platform for any SMEs to run their businesses online,&#8221; she said in an interview. &#8220;ERP sounds a bit scary especially because it makes one think of companies like SAP, long implementation cycles, and so on. But here it’s the opposite.&#8221; She describes Xentral as &#8220;very lean and easy to use because you an start with one module and then add more. For SMEs it has to be super simple. I see this becoming like the Shopify for ERP.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Short, snappy, entertaining videos have become an increasingly common way for young people to receive information. Why not learn English through TikTok-like videos too? That was what prompted Angelo Huang to launch <a href="https://www.blabla.app/">Blabla</a>.</p>
<p>Originally from Taiwan, Huang relocated to Shanghai in 2019 to start Blabla after working in Silicon Valley for over a decade. A year later, Blabla was chosen as part of Y Combinator&#8217;s 2020 summer cohort. The coronavirus had begun to spread in the U.S. at the time, keeping millions at home, and interest in remote learning was reviving.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my eighth time applying to YC,&#8221; Huang, who founded two companies before Blabla, told TechCrunch during an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, Blabla announced it has raised $1.54 million in a seed round led by Amino Capital, Starling Ventures, Y Combinator, and Wayra X, the innovation arm of the Spanish telecoms giant Telefónica. While Y Combinator wasn&#8217;t particularly instrumental in Blabla&#8217;s expansion in China &#8212; one of the biggest English-learning markets &#8212; the famed accelerator was of great help introducing investors to the young company, said the founder.</p>
<p>The Blabla app pays native English speakers by the hour to create short, engaging videos tailored to English-learning students around the world. The content creators are aided by Blabla&#8217;s proprietary software that can recognize and tag their scenes, as well as third-party translation tools that can subtitle their videos. The students, in turn, pay a subscription fee to receive personalized video recommendations based on their level of proficiency. They can practice through the app&#8217;s built-in speech recognition, among other features like speaking contests and pop quizzes.</p>
<p>The startup is in a highly crowded space. In China, the online English-learning market is occupied by established companies like VIPKID, which is backed by Tencent and Sequoia Capital. Compared to VIPKID&#8217;s one-on-one tutoring model, Blabla is more affordable with its starting price of 39 yuan ($6) a month, Huang noted.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnaJ3M481po?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;The students [on mainstream English learning apps] might have to spend several thousands of RMB before they can have a meaningful conversation with their teachers. We instead recycle our videos and are able to offer lessons at much cheaper prices.&#8221;</p>
<p>The app has about 11,000 weekly users and 300-400 paid users at the moment, with 80-90% of its total users coming from China; the goal for this year is to reach 300,000 students. The funding will allow Blabla to expand in Southeast Asia and Latin America while Wayra X can potentially help it scale to Telefónica&#8217;s 340 million global users. It will be seeking brand deals with influencers on the likes of TikTok and Youtube. The new capital will also enable BlaBla to add new features, such as pairing up language learners based on their interests and profiles.</p>
<p>Blabla doesn&#8217;t limit itself to teaching English and has ambitions to bring in teachers of other languages. &#8220;We want to be a global online pay-for-knowledge platform,&#8221; said Huang.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/poshmark-is-said-to-consider-pricing-ipo-above-marketed-range">Poshmark</a>, the nine-year-old, Redwood City Ca.-based online marketplace for second-hand clothing, beauty, and home decor products, is set to start trading as a public company on the Nasdaq tomorrow after tonight pricing 6.6 million shares higher than originally planned, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/poshmark-is-said-to-consider-pricing-ipo-above-marketed-range">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>Per its report, the company, which earlier expected to sell shares at between $35 and $39 million, saw enough demand to rationalize a $42-per-share price &#8212; one that values the company at $3.5 billion on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Given investors&#8217; feverish embrace of all kinds of newly public consumer brands, including Airbnb, DoorDash and, to a more moderate degree, Wish (trading currently where it opened when it hit the market in mid-December), most industry observers anticipate smooth sailing for the company as it makes the move from private to publicly traded company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It has numerous things going for it.</p>
<p>More than 70 million Poshmark users having sold more than 130 million items through the platform since its inception, according to the company. And its revenue is moving<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in the right direction. Poshmark makes money off commissions on peer-to-peer sales and on products that it sells via wholesale, and it turned profitable last year for the first time. According to its S-1, it produced net income of $21 million off revenue of $193 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared with a net loss of $34 million on revenue of $150 million during the same period in 2019.</span></p>
<p>Also, unlike many brick-and-mortar retail businesses that were hit especially hard by pandemic-related shutdowns  &#8212; J. Crew, Neiman Marcus, and Brooks Brothers are just a few of many to declare bankruptcy &#8212; Poshmark only facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers, so it doesn&#8217;t have the burden or expense of holding inventory.</p>
<p>Not last, resale platforms of all stripes have the wind at their back right now. Resale can be more affordable. It can be a means for sellers to make money. More, shoppers are more interested than ever in sustainability, and buying someone else&#8217;s never- or lightly-used items is more environmentally friendly than supporting, say, a fast fashion brand. (Forever 21, the fast-fashion mall staple, filed for bankruptcy in 2019.)</p>
<p>What Poshmark has to overcome includes improving the customer experience, if a variety of review sites is to be believed. The company consistently receives poor marks for its quality control and support service.</p>
<p>Though profitable, it&#8217;s not yet terribly profitable, which may need to change, and quickly.</p>
<p>Poshmark, which has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/poshmark">$153 million</a> from its venture investors, is also challenged with making public market investors understand how it differs from already publicly traded rivals like eBay and <a href="https://www.therealreal.com/">The RealReal</a>, which went public in 2019 and whose current market cap is roughly $2.3 billion. It will also need to differentiate itself from other companies hot on its heels.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of its closest rivals, <a href="https://www.thredup.com/">ThredUp</a>, filed a confidential registration statement with the SEC for an IPO last fall around the same time that Poshmark did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grab Financial Group <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/others/grab-financial-groups-fintech-leadership-recognised-in-series-a-funding-round-of-over-us300-million/">said today </a>it has raised more than $300 million in Series A funding, led by South Korean firm Hanhwa Asset Management, with participation from K3 Ventures, GGV Capital, Arbor Ventures and Flourish Ventures.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e5143de1-b7f8-4410-898f-b4f9bdec823d">Financial Times reports</a> that the funding values Grab Financial, a subsidiary of ride-hailing and delivery giant Grab, at $3 billion. Both K3 Ventures and GGV Capital were early investors in Grab, which was founded in 2012.</p>
<p>Back in February 2020, Grab announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/grab-and-gojek-began-discussing-a-potential-merger-more-than-three-months-ago/">had raised $856 million in funding</a> to grow its payment and financial services. That news came during speculation that Grab and Gojek, one of it top rivals, were finally getting closer to a merger after lengthy discussions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the Grab-Gojek talks stalled, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/gojek-is-said-in-talks-with-tokopedia-for-18-billion-merger">Gojek is now reportedly in talks to merge with Indonesia e-commerce platform Tokopedia</a> instead. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/gojek-is-said-in-talks-with-tokopedia-for-18-billion-merger">According to Bloomberg</a>, the combined company would be worth $18 billion, making it a more formidable rival to Grab.</p>
<p>In its funding announcement, Grab Financial Group said its total revenues grew more than 40% in 2020, compared to 2019. This driven by strong consumer adoption of services like AutoInvest, an investment platform that allows users to invest small amounts of money at a time through the Grab app and insurance products. Grab Financial announced the launch of several financial products for consumers and SMEs in August 2020.</p>
<p>Usagea of digital financial services by consumers and SMEs in Southeast Asia increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-economy-sea.appspot.com/assets/pdf/e-Conomy_SEA_2020_Report.pdf">report</a> published by Google, Temasek and Bain &amp; Company in November, usage of banking apps and online payments, remittances, insurance products and robo-advisor investment platforms all grew in 2020, and the region’s financial services market may be reach $60 billion in revenue by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sennder.com/">Sennder</a>, a large digital road freight forwarder based out of Germany, has raised $160m in Series D financing. The round was led by an unnamed party, but round participants included Accel, Lakestar, HV Capital, Project A and Scania. Sources say <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hedosophia">Hedosophia</a> may be the unnamed growth investor, although Sennder declined to comment. To date, Sennder has raised more than $260m, allowing it to lay claim to a potential $1bn valuation.</p>
<p>Sennder directly connects enterprise shippers with trucking companies, thus disintermediating the traditional freight model. It says it will move over 1 million truckloads this year. So far it’s concentrated on the lucrative European market. In June 2020 it merged with French competitor Everoad and acquired Uber Freight’s European business last September. The European logistics and freight sector has a market size of $427bn.</p>
<p>Sennder competes with large incumbents like Wincanton and CH Robinson as well as other startups such as OnTrac in Spin, and Instafreight.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The whole digital freight forwarding market is booming. Only last November, Germany’s Forto, a digital freight forwarder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/digital-freight-forwarder-forto-raises-another-50m-in-round-led-by-inven-capital/">raised</a> another $50 million in funding taking its total raised to $103 million.</p>

<p>Sennder’s new investment will mean it can expand in European markets. It already partners with Poste Italiane in Italy, as well as Scania and Siemens, and is now supplying transport services to over 10 organizations listed in the German DAX 30, and 11 companies comprising the Euro Stoxx 50.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2015 by David Nothacker, Julius Köhler and Nicolaus Schefenacker, the company has grown to 800 employees and seven international offices.</p>
<p>David Nothacker, CEO and Co-Founder of Sennder, said: “We are now an established industry player on equal terms with other more traditional sector pioneers, but have maintained our founding spirit. As a data-driven company, we contribute to making the logistics industry fit for a sustainable future; ensuring transparency, flexibility and efficiency in the distribution of goods. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of a digitalized logistics industry.</p>
<p>Sonali De Rycker, Partner at Accel commented: “It is always fantastic to see a portfolio company reach such a significant milestone. 2020 highlighted the value that Sennder’s innovative digital offering brings to the freight industry.”</p>

<p>The firm, which in recent years has paid particularly close attention to enterprise software bets, invests heavily in the early-stage Pacific Northwest startup scene.</p>
<p>Both Li and Sharma are stepping into the Partner role after some time at the firm. Li has been with Madrona for five years while Sharma joined the team in 2020. Prior to joining Madrona, Sharma led product management teams at Amazon Web Services, worked as a software developer at Oracle and had a stint in VC as an associate at SoftBank China &amp; India. Li previously worked at the Boston Consulting Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Seattle-based Madrona raises $345M for its eighth early-stage fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/seattle-based-madrona-raises-320m-for-its-eighth-fund/embed/#?secret=U1UZi77aN6" data-secret="U1UZi77aN6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I got the chance to catch up with Li who notes that the promotion won&#8217;t necessarily mean a big shift in his day-to-day responsibilities &#8212; &#8220;At Madrona, you&#8217;re not promoted until you&#8217;re working in the next role anyway,&#8221; he says &#8212; but that he appreciates &#8220;how much trust the firm places in junior investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about leveling up his venture career during a time when public and private markets seem particularly flush with cash, Li acknowledges some looming challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;On one hand, it&#8217;s just been an amazing five years to join venture capital because things have just been up and to the right with lots of things that work; it&#8217;s just a super exciting time,&#8221; Li says. &#8220;On the other hand, from a macro perspective, you know that there&#8217;s more capital flowing into VC as an asset class than ever before. And just from that pure macro perspective, you know that that means returns are going to be lower in the next 10 years as valuations are higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Li is plenty bullish on internet companies claiming larger swaths of the global GDP and hopes to invest specifically in &#8220;low code platforms, next-gen productivity, and online communities,&#8221; Madrona notes in their announcement, while Sharma plans to continue looking at to &#8220;distributed systems, data infrastructure, machine learning, and security.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch recently talked to Li and his Madrona colleague Hope Cochran about some of the top trends in social gaming and how investors were approaching new opportunities across the gaming industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Quite a bit has happened since Snap announced last week that it was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/snapchat-locks-president-donald-trumps-account/"> indefinitely locking President Trump&#8217;s Snapchat account</a>. But after temporary bans from his Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts as well as a permanent ban from Twitter, Snap has decided that it will also be making its ban of the President&#8217;s Snapchat account permanent.</p>
<p>Though Trump&#8217;s social media preferences as a user are clear, Snapchat gave the Trump campaign a particularly effective platform to target young users who are active on the service. A permanent ban will undoubtedly complicate his future business and political ambitions as he finds himself removed from most mainstream social platforms.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s deplatorming follows riots last week at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob emboldened by the President himself. Since then, a number of companies have severed ties with the Trump brand, while social platforms have aimed to minimize Trump&#8217;s presence on their platforms in his final days as President and beyond.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snap says it made the decision in light of repeated attempted violations of the company&#8217;s community guidelines that had been made over the past several months by the President&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last week we announced an indefinite suspension of President Trump’s Snapchat account, and have been assessing what long term action is in the best interest of our Snapchat community. In the interest of public safety, and based on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence, which are clear violations of our guidelines, we have made the decision to permanently terminate his account,” a Snap spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s decision to permanently ban the President was first reported by <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-snapchat-will-permanently-ban-trumps-account-05419dd3-fed6-4614-9ed0-c2d606ef0e62.html">Axios</a>.</p>
