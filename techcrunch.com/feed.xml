										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new project from Microsoft&#8217;s in-house incubator, Microsoft Garage, introduces a different take on meeting transcriptions. While today there are a number of real-time transcription apps to use on your phone &#8212; like <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter.ai</a> or Google&#8217;s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.recorder&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Recorder</a> app for Pixel devices, for example &#8212; Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/group-transcribe/id1527145885">new Group Transcribe app</a> reimagines meeting transcriptions as a more collaborative process, where everyone simultaneously records the meeting on their own device for higher accuracy. It also offers real-time translation for languages spoken in over 80 distinct locales.</p>
<p>To use the app, one person would first initiate the meeting in their own device. They can then invite the other meeting attendees to join the session via Bluetooth, a scannable QR code or by sharing a link. After the other participants join the session and the meeting begins, each person will see the transcript appear in real-time on their own device.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120346" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120346" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2120346" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png?w=401" alt="" width="401" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png?resize=401,680 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot4-1.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120346" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app, which is powered by A.I. speech and language technology, is able to transcribe with higher accuracy and speaker attribution based on the volume of the speaker captured by the microphone of each phone being used in the meeting.</p>
<p>By comparing the level of a person&#8217;s voice volume, the cloud service attempts to determine which device is closest to the speaker and the language preferences of that speaker. This means speakers are also accurately labeled in the app, which can be a challenge for other transcription apps where only one person is recording.</p>
<p>In addition, if meeting participants want to speak in their own language, the app can provide the translation to others&#8217; devices in their own language.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120347" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120347" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2120347" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png?w=401" alt="" width="401" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png?resize=401,680 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot3-1.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120347" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft says the app is designed with accessibility in mind, as it makes it easier for people who are deaf, hard of hearing, and non-native speakers to more fully participate in meetings by following along through the live transcriptions and translations.</p>
<p>The project itself was built by Microsoft employees who collectively speak over a dozen different languages and dialects.</p>
<p>&#8220;This can be a fantastic tool for communication. What I would love to see is for this to break down barriers for people speaking across multiple languages,” said Franklin Munoz, Principal Development Lead, when <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/blog/2021/03/new-garage-project-group-transcribe-helps-you-transcribe-and-translate-while-advancing-inclusive-speech-ai/">introducing</a> the project.</p>
<p>Like most cloud-based transcription services, the app should not be used for highly confidential meetings. However, Microsoft has built granular data and privacy controls that allow users to decide if or when they want to share their conversation data.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120349" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120349" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2120349" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png?w=401" alt="" width="401" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png 425w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png?resize=401,680 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GroupTranscribe_ScreensShot1-1.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120349" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>To work, the audio and text input data collected is sent to Microsoft&#8217;s online speech recognitions and translation technologies &#8212; though with a randomly generated identifier, not your real name.</p>
<p>While Microsoft doesn&#8217;t save the meeting transcripts and recordings itself after the fact &#8212; they&#8217;re saved on your device &#8212; the app does encourage participants to &#8220;contribute&#8221; their meetings recordings to Microsoft so it can improve the service.</p>
<p>This allows Microsoft to retain the audio and speech recognition-generated text transcriptions when all meeting participants agree to opt in for that session. By reviewing the data, Microsoft aims to improve its speech recognition and speaker attribution capabilities over time, it says. The user data will then be accessed under NDA by both Microsoft employees and contractors from other companies who work for Microsoft, but won&#8217;t include any of the speakers&#8217; account credentials.</p>
<p>Reviewers will also only have access to randomized snippets of audio, not full recordings. And Microsoft says it &#8220;de-identifies&#8221; meeting recordings by removing long strings of numbers that could represent things like credit card numbers or phone numbers, for example. Users can delete their previously shared recordings at any time, but otherwise they&#8217;re retained for up to 2 years on encrypted servers, the company says.</p>
<p>Because there&#8217;s not a way for a business, at an admin level, to configure or block the &#8220;contribution&#8221; setting for all users, people should carefully weigh the advantages and risks of such a service. It&#8217;s also a Microsoft Garage project, meaning it&#8217;s meant to be more experimental and could be shuttered at any time.</p>
<p>Currently, the Group Transcribe app is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/group-transcribe/id1527145885">available on iOS only</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://clari.com">Clari</a>, the revenue operations platform that helps companies predict revenue outcomes, announced $150 million Series E today on a $1.6 billion valuation, a number that more than triples its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/clari-snags-60m-series-d-on-valuation-of-around-500m/">2019 Series D valuation</a> of $500 million.</p>
<p>Silver Lake led the latest investment with participation from B Capital Group and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, Sapphire Ventures, Madrona Ventures, Thomvest and Tenaya Capital. The company reports it has now raised a total of $285 million.</p>
<p>While COVID made 2020 trying for everyone, a company with a product that allows executive teams to understand and predict revenue at a granular level was obviously going to be in demand, and Clari saw a lot of interest over the last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It was a surreal year for us, given the momentum we had and all of the tough news we saw going on around us. For us, the usage metrics were just off the charts, as people need visibility and predictability and control over their revenue forecasts,&#8221; company co-founder and CEO Andy Byrne told me.</p>
<p>While Byrne didn&#8217;t want to discuss revenue specifics, he did point out that he beat the revenue plan he submitted to his board by 110%. He said the performance has led to a lot of inbound investor interest in the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve had such great investor interest is that [VCs] were hearing in the investment community about how transformative Clarity has been [&#8230;] just giving companies what we call revenue confidence, being able to go and understand where you&#8217;re going to be and to accurately predict the impact the pandemic is going to have on your trajectory, good or bad,&#8221; Byrne explained.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ibf93PshvR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/gong-raises-another-200m-on-2-2-billion-valuation/">Gong raises another $200M on $2.2B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gong raises another $200M on $2.2B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/gong-raises-another-200m-on-2-2-billion-valuation/embed/#?secret=Ibf93PshvR" data-secret="Ibf93PshvR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To this point, the company has been working with sales and marketing teams, but Byrne says that the company is expanding the scope of the product to bring that same predictability to other parts of an organization.</p>
<p>Clari has mostly focused on technology companies with customers like HPE, Workday and Adobe, but it has plans to expand beyond that vertical. In fact, one of the ways Byrne plans to put today&#8217;s investment to work is to push into other verticals, which could also benefit from this kind of revenue visibility.</p>
<p>The company is up 300 employees with plans to double that number by the end of 2020. Byrne says he is building a positive work culture and points to recently being recognized as one of the best places to work by Inc., Bay Area News Group, #GirlsClub and Built In. He says they have made progress when it comes to diversity hirings across a number dimensions, but admits there is still work to be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually specifically [established] a commission around diversity and inclusion that has board level [backing] that we&#8217;re running to continue to do better work there. Having said that, we still recognize that we&#8217;re not too dissimilar to a lot of companies where we feel like there&#8217;s so much more that we need to do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At this point in the company&#8217;s evolution with plenty of money in the bank and a healthy valuation, Byrne did not shy away from the IPO question, although as you would imagine, he wasn&#8217;t ready to discuss specifics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say the answer is unequivocally yes, and we&#8217;re building toward this. [&#8230;] We don&#8217;t have a timeframe upon which we know where we&#8217;re going to go public, but the next goal is to get to the IPO starting line,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today’s the day we roll up our collective sleeves, engage in vital conversations about diversity, inclusion and equity in tech — and continue the important work of building a better industry for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a> features <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">an impressive agenda</a> packed with interactive presentations, breakout sessions and panel discussions with some of the tech world’s brightest innovators, leaders and worker-activists. These folks are in the trenches, changing the world and creating exciting business opportunities. That’s a win-win.</p>
<p>Last-minute decision maker? No problem. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">Join the conversation here</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You’ll also have time to network and connect with attendees around the world, enjoy startup presentations and even meet some of the early-stage companies in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/include/">TC Include</a> founder cohort.</p>
<p>We’re got an incredibly deep bench of talented experts and visionaries ready to take the virtual stage. Here are just a few of the panels and people you simply don’t want to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the Next Unicorn:</strong> Arlan Hamilton, the founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, has raised more than $12 million to back 150 companies led by underrepresented founders. In this session, Hamilton will discuss how she vets the biggest opportunities in investment, and how to disrupt in a positive way.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying and Dismantling Tech&#8217;s Deep Systems of Bias:</strong> Nearly every popular technology or service has within it systems of bias or exclusion, ignored by the privileged but obvious to the groups affected. How should these systems be exposed and documented, and how can we set about eliminating them and preventing more from appearing in the future? AI for the People’s Mutale Nkonde, disability rights lawyer Haben Girma, and author of Algorithms of Oppression Safiya Umoja Noble discuss a more inclusive future.</p>
<p><strong>Founders in Focus:</strong> We sit down with the founders poised to be the next big disruptors in this industry. Here we chat with Tracy Chou of Block Party, which works to protect people from abuse and harassment online.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of Online Hate and Where Social Media Goes From Here: Toxic</strong> culture, deadly conspiracies and organized hate have exploded online in recent years. We’ll discuss how much responsibility social networks have in the rise of these phenomena and how to build healthy online communities that make society better, not worse. Naj Austin (Somewhere Good &amp; Ethel\&#8217;s Club), Jesse Lehrich (Accountable Tech) and Rashad Robinson (Color of Change)</p>
<p><strong>Meeting of the Minds:</strong> Diversity and inclusion as an idea has been on the agenda of tech companies for years now. But the industry still lacks true inclusion, despite best efforts put forth by heads of diversity, equity and inclusion at these companies. We’ll seek to better understand what’s standing in the way of progress and what it’s going to take to achieve real change. Sandra Altine (Facebook), Wade Davis (Netflix) and Bo Young Lee (Uber)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a> kicks off today. Join your colleagues, learn, connect, and discover new ways and opportunities to build stronger startups and a more just tech industry for all people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.presight.vc">Presight Capital</a> has closed its $350 million second fund only a year and a half after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/presight-capital/">announced an $80 million first fund</a>. In fact, General Partner Christian Angermayer told me that the fund was raised in just a few weeks, and that it shot past the initial goal of $250 million.</p>
<p>Presight is the international venture arm of Angermayer&#8217;s family office <a href="https://www.apeiron-investments.com">Apeiron Investment Group</a>, which has more than $2.5 billion in assets under management. When I spoke to him about Presight&#8217;s first fund, he emphasized the firm&#8217;s ability to help U.S. startups expand into Europe while navigating the regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>Angermayer told me the strategy remains the same for the second, and he pointed to a couple other key elements to the Presight approach. For one thing, there&#8217;s the firm&#8217;s co-investing approach: &#8220;Sometimes we&#8217;re co-leading [the round], but there&#8217;s always a partner we work with.&#8221; And although Presight has a relatively small investment team — besides Angermayer, there&#8217;s General Partner Fabian Hansen and Principal Philipp Schreiber — portfolio companies also have access to the larger Apeiron team (20 full-time employees) and network.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hansen said that Presight remains sector agnostic in its investments, with a particular interest in biotech and deeptech. It&#8217;s already had some big successes in these fields, with <a href="https://www.abcellera.com/news/2020-05-27-abcellera-closes-series-b-financing">an early investment</a> in AI-powered drug discovery platform AbCellera <a href="https://www.archyde.com/ai-biotech-provider-abcellera-goes-public-with-enormous-success/">leading to an IPO</a> and Compass Pathways (a company that has patented a synthetic version of psilocybin to treat depression) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-18/-magic-mushroom-company-moves-toward-mainstream-in-nasdaq-ipo">also going public</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120336" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120336" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2120336" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?w=680" alt="Fabian Hansen" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HSL6637.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120336" class="wp-caption-text">Fabian Hansen</p></div></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-cant-put-price-tag-life-except-we-can-christian-angermayer/">a LinkedIn post</a> published last fall, Angermayer argued that biotech will be the biggest sector over the next 10 to 20 years, and that the key metric in this field is quality-adjusted life years — the idea being that a year of life at perfect health is worth 1 QALY, death is zero, while life without perfect health is somewhere in between (or could even have a value below zero).</p>
<p>&#8220;And here’s the real conclusion: The big winners – besides everyone benefitting from these advances – will be the companies who are PRODUCING QALYs: biotech companies,&#8221; Angermayer wrote. And he is open about the fact that he has a personal motive in this: &#8220;Put simply, I want to live forever! And in perfect health! And it is my sincere belief that we will achieve the means to do this within the next 20-30 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hansen added that there&#8217;s a &#8220;whole generation&#8221; of executives at biotech firms who are launching new startups as they realize, &#8220;I can start my own company, it&#8217;s not that expensive to try out new things, I can raise a venture round.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a source with knowledge of the firm, limited partners in Presight Fund Two include AbCellera founder and CEO Carl Hansen, former Goldman Sachs CFO Martin Chavez, Uma Thurman, Founders Forum co-founder Brent Hoberman, Point72 and the family offices of XING founder Lars Inrich, Nicole Junkermann, Louis Bacon, Alan Howard and Mike Novogratz. Plus, Angermayer himself invested $60 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While we&#8217;ve written about attempts to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/iab-cookie/">build alternatives to cookies that track users across websites</a>, Google says it won&#8217;t be going down that route.</p>
<p>The search giant had already announced that it will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">phasing out support for third-party cookies in its Chrome browser.</a> Today it went further, with David Temkin (Google&#8217;s director of product management for ads privacy and trust) writing in <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/">a blog post</a> that &#8220;once third-party cookies are phased out, we will not build alternate identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web, nor will we use them in our products.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We realize this means other providers may offer a level of user identity for ad tracking across the web that we will not — like [personally identifiable information] graphs based on people’s email addresses,&#8221; Temkin continued. &#8220;We don’t believe these solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term investment.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean ads won&#8217;t be targeted at all. Instead, he argued that thanks to &#8220;advances in aggregation, anonymization, on-device processing and other privacy-preserving technologies,&#8221; it&#8217;s no longer necessary to &#8220;track individual consumers across the web to get the performance benefits of digital advertising.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fUZ9knBNUe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/embed/#?secret=fUZ9knBNUe" data-secret="fUZ9knBNUe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As an example, Temkin pointed to a new approach being tested by Google called Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), which allows ads to be targeted at large groups of users based on common interests. He said Google will begin testing FLoCs with advertisers in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Temkin also said that these changes are focused on third-party data and don&#8217;t affect the ability of publishers to track and target their own visitors: &#8220;We will continue to support first-party relationships on our ad platforms for partners, in which they have direct connections with their own customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that the Electronic Frontier Foundation has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/google-claims-almost-no-change-in-ad-revenue-from-targeting-proposals-in-its-privacy-sandbox-but-privacy-upside-less-clear/">described FLoCs</a> as &#8220;the opposite of privacy-preserving technology” and compared them to a &#8220;behavioral credit score.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while cookies have been phased out across the industry, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">currently investigating Google&#8217;s cookie plan</a> over antitrust concerns, with critics suggesting that Google is using privacy as an excuse to increase its market power. (A similar criticism has been <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-apple-facebook-and-mobile-advertising/">leveled against Apple</a> over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">upcoming privacy changes in iOS</a>.)</p>

Today, the company announced a $48 million Series C financing round to help build on that momentum.</p>
<p>Lightspeed Venture Partners led the round with participation from Greenspring Associates, Dell Technologies Capital, Wipro Ventures and 8VC. Today&#8217;s round comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/yugabyte-lands-30m-series-b-as-open-source-database-continues-to-flourish/">the startup&#8217;s $30 million Series B</a> last June, and brings the total raised to $103 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>Kannan Muthukkaruppan, Yugabyte co-founder and president, says the startup saw a marked increase in interest in both the open source and commercial offerings in 2020 as the pandemic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/the-cloud-infrastructure-market-hit-129b-in-2020/">pushed many companies to the cloud</a> faster than they might have gone otherwise, something many startup founders have pointed out to me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The distributed SQL space is definitely heating up, and if anything over the last six months almost in every vector in terms of enterprise customers &#8212; from Fortune 500 companies across financial, retail, ISP or telcos &#8212; are putting Yugabyte in production to be the system of record database to meet some of their business critical services needs,&#8221; Muthukkaruppan told me.</p>
<p>In addition, he&#8217;s seeing a similar rise in the level of interest from the open source version of the product.&#8221;Similarly, the groundswell on the community and the open source adoption has been phenomenal. Our Slack [open source] user community quadrupled in 2020,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That kind of momentum led to the increased investor interest, says co-founder and CTO Karthik Ranganathan. &#8220;Some of the primary reasons to go and even ask for funding was that we realized we could accelerate some of this stuff, and we couldn&#8217;t do that with the original $30 million we had raised,&#8221; he said. The original thinking was to do a secondary raise in the $15-20 million, but multiple investors expressed interest in participating, and it ended up being a $48 million round when all was said and done.</p>
<p>Former Pivotal president Bill Cook came on board as CEO at the same time they were announcing their last funding round in June and brought some enterprise chops to the table. It was his job to figure out how to expand the market opportunity with larger high-value enterprise clients. &#8220;And so the last six or seven months has been about that, dealing with enterprise clients on one hand and then this emerging developer led cloud offering as well,&#8221; Cook said.</p>

<p>The company has a three tier offering that includes the open source YugabyteDB. Then there is a fully managed cloud version called Yugabyte Cloud, and finally there is a self-managed cloud version of the database called Yugabyte Platform. The latter is especially attractive to large enterprise customers, who want to be in the cloud, but still want to maintain control of their data and infrastructure, and so choose to manage the cloud installation themselves.</p>
<p>The company started last year with 50 employees, doubled that to this point, and now expects to reach 200 by the end of this year. As they add employees, the leadership team is cognizant of the importance of building a diverse and inclusive workforce, while recognizing the challenges in doing so.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s work in progress as always. We&#8217;ve added diversity candidates right along the whole spectrum as we&#8217;ve grown but from my perspective it&#8217;s never sufficient, and we just need to keep pushing on it hard, and I think as a leadership team we recognize that,&#8221; Cook said.</p>
<p>The three leaders of the company have been working together remotely now since the announcement in June, and had only met briefly in person prior to the pandemic shutting down offices, but they say that it has gone smoothly. And while they would obviously like to meet in person again when the time is right, the momentum the company is experiencing shows that things are moving in the right direction, regardless of where they are getting their work done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open source software is at the core of&#8230; well, practically everything online. But while much of it is diligently maintained in some ways, in others it doesn&#8217;t receive the kind of scrutiny that something so foundational ought to. $1.3 million worth of grants were announced today, split among 13 projects looking to ensure open source software and development is being done equitably, sustainably, and responsibly.</p>
<p>The research projects will look into a number of questions about the way open source digital infrastructure is being used, maintained, and otherwise affected. For instance, many municipalities rely on and create this sort of infrastructure constantly as the need for government software solutions grows, but what are the processes by which this is done? Which approaches or frameworks succeed, and why?</p>
<p>And what about the private companies that contribute to major open-source projects, often without consulting one another — how do they communicate and share priorities and dependencies? How could that be improved, and with what costs and benefits?</p>
<p>These and other questions aren&#8217;t the type that any single organization or local government is likely to take on spontaneously, and of course the costs of such studies aren&#8217;t trivial. But they were deemed interesting enough (and possibly likely to generate new approaches and products) by a team of experts who sorted through about 250 applications over the last year.</p>

<p>The grantmaking operation is funded and organized by the Ford Foundation, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Open Society Foundations, Omidyar Network, and the Mozilla Open Source Support Program in collaboration with the Open Collective Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a dearth of funding for looking at the needs and potential applications of free and open source infrastructure. The public interest issues behind open source have been the missing piece,&#8221; said Michael Brennan, who&#8217;s leading<a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/the-latest/news/major-philanthropies-tackle-inequality-by-strengthening-how-open-source-code-is-developed-and-maintained/"> the grant program at the Ford Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The president of the foundation [Darren Walker] once said, &#8216;a just society relies on a just Internet,&#8217; &#8221; he quoted. &#8220;So our question is how do we create that just Internet? How do we create and sustain an equitable Internet that serves everyone equally? We actually have a lot more questions than answers, and few people are funding research into those questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even finding the right questions is part of the question, of course, but in basic research that&#8217;s expected. Early work in a field can seem frustratingly general or inconclusive because it&#8217;s as much about establishing the scope and general direction of the work as it is about suggesting actual courses of action.</p>

<p>&#8220;The final portfolio wasn&#8217;t just about the &#8216;objectively best&#8217; ones, but how do we find a diversity of approaches and ideas, and tackle different aspects of this work, and also be representative of the diverse and global nature of the project?&#8221; Brennan said. &#8220;This year we also accepted proposals for both research and implementation. We want to see that the research is informing the building of that equitable and sustainable infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://opencollective.com/di-grants">You can read the full research abstracts here</a>, but these are the short versions, with the proposer&#8217;s name:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are COVID data infrastructures created and transformed by builders and maintainers from the open source community? &#8211; <em>Megan Finn (University of Washington, University of Texas, Northeastern University)</em></li>
<li>How is digital infrastructure a critical response to fight climate change? &#8211; <em>Narrira Lemos de Souza</em></li>
<li>How do perceptions of unfairness when contributing to an open source project affect the sustainability of critical open source digital infrastructure projects? &#8211; <em>Atul Pokharel (NYU)</em></li>
<li>Supporting projects to implement research-informed best practices at the time of need on governance, sustainability, and inclusion. &#8211; <em>Danielle Robinson (Code for Science &amp; Society)</em></li>
<li>Assessing Partnerships for Municipal Digital Infrastructure &#8211; <em>Anthony Townsend (Cornell Tech)</em></li>
<li>Implement recommendations for funders of open source infrastructure with guides, programming, and models &#8211; <em>Eileen Wagner, Molly Wilson, Julia Kloiber, Elisa Lindinger, and Georgia Bullen (Simply Secure &amp; Superrr)</em></li>
<li>How we can build a “Creative Commons” for API terms of Service, as a contract to automatically read, control and enforce APIs Terms of service between infrastructure and applications? &#8211; <em>Mehdi Medjaoui (APIdays, LesMainteneurs, Inno3)</em></li>
<li>Indian case study of governance, implementation, and private sector role of open source infrastructure projects &#8211; <em>​Digital Asia Hub</em></li>
<li>Will cross-company visibility into shared free and open source dependencies lead to cross-company collaboration and efforts to sustain shared dependencies? &#8211; <em>​Duane O&#8217;Brien</em></li>
<li>How do open source tools contribute towards creating a multilingual internet? &#8211; <em>Anushah Hossain (UC Berkeley)</em></li>
<li>How digital infrastructure projects could embrace cooperatives as a sustainable model for working &#8211; ​<em>Jorge Benet (Cooperativa Tierra Común)</em></li>
<li>How do technical decision-makers assess the security ramifications of open source software components before adopting them in their projects and where can systemic interventions to the FOSS ecosystem be targeted to collectively improve its security? &#8211; <em>Divyank Katira (Centre for Internet &amp; Society in Bangalore)</em></li>
<li>How can African participation in the development, maintenance, and application of the global open source digital infrastructure be enhanced? &#8211; <em>Alex Comninos (Research ICT Africa (RIA) and the University of Cape Town)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The projects will receive their grants soon, and later in the year (or whenever they&#8217;re ready) the organizers will coordinate some kind of event at which they can present their results. Brennan made it clear that the funders take no stake in the projects and aren&#8217;t retaining or publishing the research themselves; they&#8217;re just coordinating and offering support where it makes sense.</p>
<p>$1.3 million is an interesting number. For some, it&#8217;s peanuts. A startup might burn through that cash in a month or two. But in an academic context, a hundred grand can be the difference between work getting done or being abandoned. The hope is that small injections at the base layer produce a better environment for the type of support the Ford Foundation and others provide as part of their other philanthropic and grantmaking efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At a time when e-commerce is exploding due in large part to the pandemic, a business that helps any online merchant ship goods to a consumer in one or two days is going to be in demand. <a href="https://deliverr.com/">Deliverr</a> is a startup that fits that bill, and today the company announced a $170 million financing round.</p>
<p>The round breaks down to $135 million Series D financing led by Coatue. The remaining $35 million comes in the form of a convertible note led by Brookfield Technology Partners. Existing investors Activant Capital, 8VC and GLP participated in both parts of the investment. In less than four years, the company has raced from from rounds A to D, raising $240 million along the way.</p>
<p>Deliverr co-founder and CEO Michael Krakaris says it has been a rapid rise, but that his business requires a lot of capital. &#8220;It has been this really kind of crazy journey, and we&#8217;ve been growing very fast, but also this space is very capital intensive, and it&#8217;s a winner-take-all market where you gain efficiency at scale. You know scale is what makes your model highly defensible in this space,&#8221; Krakaris told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The way Deliverr works is it uses software to determine how to get goods to warehouses in parts of the country where they are needed. It then uses these warehouses&#8217; fulfillment departments to help pick and pack the order. The software then finds the fastest and cheapest delivery method and it gets shipped to customers with a two-day delivery guarantee. They are also ramping a next-day delivery product to expand the business.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Coupa Software snags Llamasoft for $1.5B to bring together spending and supply chain data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/coupa-software-snags-llamasoft-for-1-5b-to-bring-together-spending-and-supply-chain-data/embed/#?secret=ZDUQw8xPO2" data-secret="ZDUQw8xPO2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Deliverr doesn&#8217;t actually own any warehouses. It rents out space, and part of the challenge of building this business is establishing relationships with those warehouses and working out a business arrangement, one that is still evolving as the company grows. &#8220;A year ago, I would have said we typically wanted to be 5-10% of a warehouse&#8217;s business. There are cases now where we are 100% of these warehouses&#8217; businesses. We&#8217;ve grown to that level,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Krakaris says that the pandemic raised major challenges for the company. Just setting up a relationship with new warehouses could require driving long distances because getting on a plane would mean quarantining when they landed. In some instances there were shortages of items. In others, COVID would shut down all of the warehouses in a given region, forcing the executive team to make a set of business adjustments on the fly, but this constant crisis mentality also helped them learn how to shift resources quickly, a lesson that is highly useful in this business.</p>
<p>The company started 2020 with 50 people and have added 100 employees since. They plan to double that this year, although that is variable depending on how the year goes. He say that another challenge is that he has done this hiring during COVID, and has never met a majority of his workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve never met more than half the company in person, but I&#8217;m try to be as open as I can and learn about everyone, and we hold events to try and get to know everybody, but obviously it&#8217;s not like being together in person,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/brave/">Brave</a>, the privacy-focused browser co-founded by ex-Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich, is getting ready to launch an own-brand search engine for desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s announced the acquisition of an open source search engine developed by the team behind the (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/cliqz-pulls-the-plug-on-a-european-anti-tracking-alternative-to-google-search/">now defunct</a>) Cliqz anti-tracking search-browser combo. The tech will underpin the forthcoming Brave Search engine &#8212; meaning it will soon be pitching its millions of users on an entirely &#8216;big tech&#8217;-free search and browsing experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the hood, nearly all of today’s search engines are either built by, or rely on, results from Big Tech companies. In contrast, the Tailcat search engine is built on top of a completely independent index, capable of delivering the quality people expect but without compromising their privacy,&#8221; Brave writes in a press release announcing the acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Tailcat does not collect IP addresses or use personally identifiable information to improve search results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cliqz, which was a privacy-focused European fork of Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox browser, got shuttered last May after its majority investor, <a href="https://www.burda.com/de/news/cliqz-schliesst-bereiche/">Hubert Burda Media</a>, called time on the multi-year effort to build momentum for an alternative to Google &#8212; blaming tougher trading conditions during the pandemic for forcing it to pull the plug sooner than it would have liked.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cliqz pulls the plug on a European anti-tracking alternative to Google search&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/cliqz-pulls-the-plug-on-a-european-anti-tracking-alternative-to-google-search/embed/#?secret=ZmhXeylP5h" data-secret="ZmhXeylP5h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The former Cliqz dev team, who had subsequently been working on Tailcat, are moving to Brave as part of the acquisition. The engineering team is led by Dr Josep M Pujol &#8212; who is quoted in Brave&#8217;s PR saying it&#8217;s &#8220;excited to be working on the only real private search/browser alternative to Big Tech&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tailcat is a fully independent search engine with its own search index built from scratch,&#8221; Eich told TechCrunch. &#8220;Tailcat as Brave Search will offer the same privacy guarantees that Brave has in its browser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brave will provide the first private browser+search alternative to the Big Tech platforms, and will make it seamless for users to browse and search with guaranteed privacy. Also, owing to its transparent nature, Brave Search will address algorithmic biases and prevent outright censorship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brave getting into the search business is a reflection of its confidence that privacy is becoming mainstream, per Eich. He points to &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; growth in usage of its browser over the past year &#8212; up from 11M monthly active users to 26M+ &#8212; which he says has mirrored the surge in usage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">earlier this year</a> seen by the (not-for-profit) e2e encrypted messaging app Signal (after Facebook-owned WhatsApp announced a change to its privacy policies to allow for increased data-sharing with Facebook through WhatsApp business accounts).</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect to see even greater demand for Brave in 2021 as more and more users demand real privacy solutions to escape Big Tech’s invasive practices,” he added in a statement. “Brave’s mission is to put the user first, and integrating privacy-preserving search into our platform is a necessary step to ensure that user privacy is not plundered to fuel the surveillance economy.”</p>

<p>Brave Search will be offered as a choice to users alongside a roster of more established third parties (Google, Bing, Qwant, Ecosia etc) which they can select as their browser default.</p>
<p>It will also potentially become the default (i.e. if users don&#8217;t pick their own) in future, per Eich.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to support &#8216;open search&#8217; with multiple alternative engines,&#8221; he confirmed. &#8220;User choice is a permanent principle at Brave. Brave will continue to offer multiple alternative choices for the user’s default search engine, and we think our users will seek unmatched privacy with Brave Search. When ready, we hope to make Brave Search the default engine in Brave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked how the quality of Tailcat-powered results vs Google Eich described it as &#8220;quite good&#8221;, adding that it &#8220;will only get better with adoption&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google’s &#8216;long tail&#8217; is hard for any engine to beat but we have a plan to compete on that front too, once integrated into the Brave browser,&#8221; he told us in an email interview, arguing that Google&#8217;s massive size does offer some competitive opportunities for a search rival. &#8220;There are aspects where Google is falling behind. It is difficult for them to innovate in search when that’s the main source of their revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are risk-averse against experimenting with new techniques and transparency, while under pressure from shareholders to tie their own businesses into scarce search engine results page (SERP) area, and pressure from search engine optimization (SEO).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On questions such as censorship, community feedback, and algorithmic transparency, we think we can do better from the get-go. Unlike other search engines, we believe that the only way to make big improvements is to build afresh, with the know-how that comes from building,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The option of using Bing (as other search offerings do) instead of building the index exists but it will get you only as far as Bing in terms of quality (and as with such offerings, you’ll be wholly dependent on Bing).&#8221;</p>
<p>Brave is aiming for general availability of Brave Search by the summer &#8212; if not late spring, per Eich. Users interested in testing an early iteration can sign up for a <a href="http://brave.com/search">waitlist here</a>. (A test version is slated as coming in &#8220;the next few weeks&#8221;.)</p>
<p>The name Tailcat is unlikely to be widely familiar as it was an internal project that Cliqz had not implemented into its browser before it was shut down.</p>
<p>Eich says development had been continuing at Burda &#8212; &#8220;in order to develop a full-fledged search engine&#8221;. (When the holding company a<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nnounced the shuttering of Cliqz, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.burda.com/en/news/cliqz-closes-areas-browser-and-search-technologies/">last April</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, it stated that Cliqz&#8217;s browser and search technologies would be shut down but also said it would draw out a team of experts &#8212; to work on technical issues in areas like AI and search.)</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Cliqz offered the SERP-based search engine but had not implemented Tailcat in its browser yet,&#8221; said Eich. &#8220;After Cliqz shut down last April, a development team at Burda continued to work on the search technology under the new project name Tailcat in order to develop a full-fledged search engine. The team hoped to find a long-term home for their work to continue their mission, and are thrilled to be part of Brave.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition are not being disclosed &#8212; but we&#8217;ve confirmed that Burda is becoming a Brave shareholder as part of the deal.</p>
<p>“We are very happy that our technology is being used at Brave and that, as a result, a <u></u><u></u>genuine, privacy-friendly alternative to Google is being created in the core web <u></u><u></u>functions of browsing and searching,” said Paul-Bernhard Kallen, CEO of Hubert Burda Media, in a supporting statement. “As a Brave stakeholder we will continue to be involved in this exciting project.”</p>
<p>While Brave started out focused on building an alternative browser &#8212; with the idea of rethinking the predominate ad-funded Internet business model by baking in a cryptocurrency rewards system to generate payments for content creators (and pay users for their attention) &#8212; it now talks about itself as a pro-privacy &#8220;super app&#8221;.</p>
<p>Currently, the Brave Browser bundles a privacy-preserving ad platform (<a href="https://brave.com/brave-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/brave-ads/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614762976261000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDcbQpFf8g4R6rFI_PNQzxTSX6Xw">Brave Ads</a>); news reader (<a href="https://brave.com/announcing-brave-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/announcing-brave-today/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614762976261000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEP8PfxyjoONyl1WWCwP2Kobv6hIA">Brave Today</a>); and offers a <a href="https://brave.com/brave-and-guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/brave-and-guardian/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614762976261000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXFbjYtVmgW1GlCTqqRiX7lVFRZg">Firewall+VPN service</a> &#8212; which it will be further adding to with the forthcoming search engine (<a href="http://brave.com/search">Brave Search</a>), and a privacy-preserving video-conferencing service (<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/brave-together">Brave Together</a>) that&#8217;s also in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The unifying brand proposition for its &#8216;super app&#8217; is a pledge to provide users with genuine control over their online experience &#8212; in contrast to mainstream alternatives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost by default, open-source developers get very little insight into who uses their projects. In part, that&#8217;s the beauty of open source, but for developers who want to monetize their projects, it&#8217;s also a bit of a curse because they get very little data back from these projects. While you usually know who bought your proprietary software &#8212; and those tools often send back some telemetry, too &#8212; that&#8217;s not something that holds true for open-source code. <a href="https://about.scarf.sh/">Scarf</a> is trying to change that.</p>
<p>In its earliest incarnation, Scarf founder Avi Press tried to go the telemetry route for getting this kind of data. He had written a few successful developer tools and as they got more popular, he realized that he was spending an increasingly large amount of time supporting his users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120117" style="width: 361px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120117" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2120117" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg" alt="Scarf founder Avi Press" width="351" height="423" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg?resize=124,150 124w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg?resize=249,300 249w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210217_204403624.MP_2-1.jpeg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120117" class="wp-caption-text">Scarf co-founder and CEO Avi Press (<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Scarf)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This project was now really sapping my time and energy, but also clearly providing value to big companies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s really what got me thinking that there&#8217;s probably an opportunity to maybe provide support or build features just for these companies, or do something to try to make some money from that, or really just better support those commercial users.&#8221; But he also quickly realized that he had virtually no data about how the project was being used beyond what people told him directly and download stats from GitHub and other places. So as he tried to monetize the project, he had very little data to inform his decisions and he had no way of knowing which companies to target directly that were already quietly using his code.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were working at any old company &#8212; pushing code out to an app or a website &#8212; if you pushed out code without any observability, that would be reckless. You would you get fired over something like that. Or maybe not, but it&#8217;s a really poor decision to make. And this is the norm for every domain of software &#8212; except open source.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120118" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120118" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120118 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png" alt="" width="480" height="504" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png?resize=143,150 143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png?resize=286,300 286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-4.01.10-PM-1.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2120118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Scarf</p></div></p>
<p>That led to the first version of Scarf: a package manager that would provide usage analytics and make it easy to sell different versions of a project. But that wasn&#8217;t quite something <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20768365">the community</a> was ready to accept &#8212; and a lot of people questioned the open-source nature of the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;What really came out of those conversations, even chatting with people who were really, really against this kind of approach &#8212; everyone agrees that the package registries already have all of this data. So NPM and Docker and all these companies that have this data &#8212; there are many, many requests of developers for this data,&#8221; Press said, and noted that there is obviously a lot of value in this data.</p>
<p>So the new Scarf now takes a more sophisticated approach. While it still offers an NPM library that does phone home and pixel tracking for documentation, its focus is now on registries. What the company is essentially launching this week is a kind of middle layer between the code and the registry that allows developers to, for example, point users of their containers to the Scarf registry first and then Scarf sits in front of the Docker Hub or the GitHub Container Registry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell us, where are your containers located? And then your users pull the image through Scarf and Scarf just redirects the traffic to wherever it needs to go. But then all the traffic that flows through Scarf, we can expose that to the maintainers. What company did that pull come from? Was it on a laptop or on CI? What cloud provider was it on? What container runtime was it using? What version of the software did they pull down? And all of these things that are actually pretty trivial to answer from this traffic &#8212; and the registries could have been doing this whole time but unfortunately have not done so.&#8221;</p>
<p>To fund its efforts, Scarf recently raised a $2 million seed funding round led by <a href="http://wave.capital/">Wave Capital</a>, with participation from 468 Capital and a number of angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the startups raising capital in Mexico are focused on financial inclusion, aiming to level the playing field in a country that is largely unbanked and has a burgeoning middle class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such company, <a href="https://minu.mx">minu</a>, a Mexico City-based, pay-on-demand startup, announced Wednesday that it has raised $14 million in a Series A round of funding led by FinTech Collective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors VEF, XYZ Ventures, and FJ Labs, as well as DocuSign founder Tom Gonser and Gusto CFO Mike Dinsdale also participated in the financing. Existing backers QED, Next Billion Ventures, and Village Global also put more money in the company. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing &#8212; which included $2.5 million in debt from Banco Sabadell Mexico &#8212; brings minu’s total raised since its 2019 inception to a total of $20 million.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founders Nima Pourshasb, Rafa Niell, and Paolo Rizzi were driven to build out a pay on demand offering in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really think the lack of financial health is one of the key drivers slowing the potential and productivity of Mexican society,” Pourshasb said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minu aims to solve the employee liquidity gap between paychecks in an effort to help people see reduced financial stress and avoid expensive loans. The company offers 24&#215;7 instant access to employees’ earned wages for a $2 fixed withdrawal fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, minu has over 100 large enterprise clients including TotalPlay, Telefonica, Scotiabank, OfficeMax, Rappi, Adecco, Manpower, Cap Gemini, and public sector clients such as the Electoral Institute of the State of Mexico. It saw its transaction volume and revenue grow by 18 times in 2020, albeit from a small base. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minu operates under the premise that the liquidity gap is profound in Mexican society. An estimated 70% of workers live from paycheck to paycheck with </span><a href="https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/ingresos-de-las-familias-mexicanas-cae-a-un-promedio-de-16-536-pesos-al-mes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average wages of $550/month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, noted Pourshasb. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And only 37% of Mexicans over 15 years old </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/10/mexicans-lack-access-to-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a bank account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to recent World Bank stats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some people are continuously getting loans &#8212; at very high interest rates &#8212;  to cover recurring expenses such as food and transport,” Pourshasb said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minu’s first product offers instant, 24-7 access to earned wages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is money that is already earned,” Pourshasb said. “Our users have an app to see how much is available and if they need those funds, they can instantly receive them.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s distribution model is B2B so it works alongside large enterprises to offer access to the wages as a benefit for employees. Businesses are attracted to that model, Pourshasb explained, because they don’t have to pay for it or change their payroll process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We integrate with payroll so the process is automated and there’s no added work for them,” he added. “It also doesn’t affect cash flows. These are upfront funds so if someone withdraws money, it gets deducted from payroll.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some employers do subsidize the cost of the transaction fee for employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, minu says it will use its fresh capital to boost its headcount of 60 as well as expanding its offering to include financial education, savings, smart spend and insurance products. The company also plans to expand outside of Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlos Alonso Torras, who leads Latin America investing for New York-based FinTech Collective, believes that minu leverages “a strong combination of an exceptional founding team and auspicious macro trends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see the company&#8217;s current product as the basis for a platform that will offer an array of necessary financial products to a very underserved demographic,” he wrote via email. “Minu is already creating a moat vis a vis competitors via deep integrations, high client satisfaction and a broadening financial wellness offering. As the early mover in a market whose characteristics are conducive to the success of pay on demand, the immediate growth potential is remarkable, and Minu is uniquely positioned to excel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks the firm’s fifth in Mexico.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Overall, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech Collective says it seeks and backs entrepreneurs “who are rewiring how money flows through the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Due to COVID, we are seeing a pandemic stricken world where hundreds of millions of people are facing greater financial instability, and we believe that fintech has a vital role to play in accelerating the emergence of a spending middle class underserved by traditional financial systems,” Torras added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs in Mexico have been busy. Last week, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stori raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/stori-raises-32-5m-to-build-mexicos-credit-card-for-the-masses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $32.5 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round with the goal of “becoming Mexico’s leading credit card issuer for the rising middle class.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in February, Flink </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/accel-backs-mexican-startup-flinks-effort-to-bring-investing-to-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $12 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series A led by Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Accel.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late last night <a href="https://www.hioscar.com/">Oscar Health</a>, a tech-enabled medical insurance provider, priced its IPO <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210302006207/en/Oscar-Health-Inc.-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $39 per share</a>. The final price came in $1 per share above its raised IPO guidance; Oscar Health had originally targeted a $32-$34 per-share IPO price.</p>
<p>Some 37,041,026 shares were sold at $39, including 36,391,946 offered by the company itself. Not counting shares reserved for the company&#8217;s underwriters &#8212; more on those <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568651/000119312521066182/d107550ds1mef.htm">here</a> &#8212; Oscar Health found at least $1.44 billion worth of demand for its equity at $39 apiece. More than 98% of the funds from the aggregate share sale went to the company&#8217;s accounts.</p>
<p>For backers Thrive Capital, Founders Fund, Formation 8, CapitalG, Fidelity, Alphabet, Coatue, Tiger Global and others, the day is a financial coup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nuCvWpHuJa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/oscar-health-raises-ipo-price-as-coupang-releases-bullish-debut-valuation/">Oscar Health raises IPO price as Coupang releases bullish debut valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oscar Health raises IPO price as Coupang releases bullish debut valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/oscar-health-raises-ipo-price-as-coupang-releases-bullish-debut-valuation/embed/#?secret=nuCvWpHuJa" data-secret="nuCvWpHuJa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But just how well did the company&#8217;s private backers do? To know that, we have to calculate what the company is worth at $39 per share. Oscar sold more shares in its debut than its final S-1/A filing expected, making its ensuing share count slightly tedious to calculate. However, the company&#8217;s simple IPO valuation appears to be just over $7.92 billion at its IPO price. IPO investing group Renaissance Capital calculates the company&#8217;s fully-diluted valuation, a figure that counts some additional shares, including that have been earned through options that have yet to be exercised, for example, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/78674/Health-insurer-Oscar-Health-prices-upsized-IPO-above-the-upwardly-revised-r">at $9.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar Health&#8217;s IPO has been a success from several perspectives. From a fundraising viewpoint, the company raised more than it may have initially expected to, comparing its final price point against its initial range. From a valuation perspective, the company is now worth a multiple of its last-known private valuation, some $3.2 billion set during its 2018 Series G, per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>. The company did raise more private capital between that round and its IPO, but we lack valuation figures for those deals.</p>
<p>The company will begin trading this morning in a notable test for insurtech, and the sub-niche of medical insurtech. TechCrunch&#8217;s prior notes on the company&#8217;s IPO valuation aside, the bidding public have repriced Oscar Health. Now let&#8217;s see what the company will manage once it truly begins to float.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli fraud prevention startup Identiq has raised $47 million at Series A as the company eyes international growth, driven in large part by the spike in online spending during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The round was led by Insight Partners and Entrée Capital, with participation from Amdocs, Sony Innovation Fund by IGV, as well as existing investors Vertex Ventures Israel, Oryzn Capital, and Slow Ventures.</p>
<p>Fraud prevention is big business, which is slated to be worth $145 billion by 2026, ballooning by eightfold in size compared to 2018. But it&#8217;s a data hungry industry, fraught with security and privacy risks, having to rely on sharing enormous sets of consumer data in order to learn who legitimate customers are in order to weed out the fraudsters, and therefore.</p>
<p>Identiq takes a different, more privacy-friendly approach to fraud prevention, without having to share a customer&#8217;s data with a third-party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before now, the only way companies could solve this problem was by exposing the data they were given by the user to a third party data provider for validation, creating huge privacy problems,&#8221; Identiq&#8217;s chief executive Itay Levy told TechCrunch. &#8220;We solved this by allowing these companies to validate that the data they’ve been given matches the data of other companies that already know and trust the user, without sharing any sensitive information at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>When an Identiq customer — such as an online store — sees a new customer for the first time, the store can ask other stores in Identiq&#8217;s network if they know or trust that new customer. This peer-to-peer network uses cryptography to help online stores anonymously vet new customers to help weed out bad actors, like fraudsters and scammers, without needing to collect private user data.</p>
<p>So far, the company says it already counts Fortune 500 companies as customers.</p>
<p>Identiq said it plans to use the $47 million raise to hire and grow the company&#8217;s workforce, and aims to scale up its support for its international customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Games company Zynga has been on an acquisition tear the last several years to beef up its activity in particular in mobile and casual-puzzle games, spending over $3 billion to pick up a range of startups across Europe (specifically Turkey and Finland) in the process. Today, however, it&#8217;s taking a turn towards more immersive, highly graphic cross-platform experiences. The company has announced that it is acquiring San Francisco&#8217;s <a href="https://www.echtragames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Echtra Games</a>, the role-playing game publisher behind <a href="https://www.torchlight3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Torchlight III</a>, which is available on Steam, XBox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>The team will be working on releasing a new title in partnership with Zynga&#8217;s NaturalMotion studio, the company said. No other details on that were released for now.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. It&#8217;s also not clear who backed Echtra, if anyone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Echtra is in some ways a classic example of a gaming startup built out of a burning idea, rather than cold, calculated moneymaking &#8212; perhaps the best kind of company you can have.</p>
<p>Max Schaefer, the co-founder and CEO, had previously been at Runic Games, the developer of the original Torchlight series, as well as Diablo and others. Runic was shuttered by its owner, Perfect World, and so in 2016, Shaefer went on to form a new company, Echtra, with some of his Runic colleagues and others in the industry because he saw more life left in the franchise.</p>
<p>That perhaps didn&#8217;t play out as well as Echtra had hoped, though. After the game exited early access into general availability, it received <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/torchlight-3-review-a-disappointing-and-dreary-return" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mixed reviews</a>, some of the criticism leveled at <a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/torchlight-3/interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the game was built</a>, and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight3/comments/kl1svr/bug_on_tutorial_quest_from_a_humble_seed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of bugs</a>.</p>
<p>The plan will be to bring on Echtra&#8217;s team and expertise, potentially to continue building the franchise, but more generally to help Zynga build out more of a footprint in cross-platform games, and also gaming technology, in particular around tools built on Unreal Engine, the platform of choice at the moment for RPG and other immersive applications.</p>
<p class="p3">“Max and his team at Echtra Games are responsible for some of the most legendary game properties ever created, and they are experts in the action RPG genre and cross-platform development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m excited to welcome the Echtra Games team into the Zynga family,” said Frank Gibeau, Chief Executive Officer of Zynga, in a statement. “This acquisition will be instrumental in growing our iconic licenses and brands from mobile to PCs and consoles, while helping to further expand Zynga’s total addressable market.”</p>
<p class="p3">&#8220;Echtra Games is delighted to be joining the Zynga family,” added Max Schaefer. “We share Zynga’s vision that cross-platform play is an essential part of the future of RPGs and interactive entertainment and are eager to apply our vast experience and talents to this effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gaming has been one of the bright spots in the last year &#8212; no surprise, since people are spending so much more time indoors and at home because of the pandemic. Zynga, as a consequence of that, has also been on a roll in recent times, with its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210210005120/en/Zynga-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth quarter earnings</a>, released last month, beating analyst expectations. Its revenues of $616 million are the highest ever quarterly bookings posted by the company. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/zynga-q4-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acquisitions are major part of its strategy</a> these days, the company said at the time.</p>
<p>Going for more immersive RPG titles outside of mobile is an ambitious and potentially more expensive undertaking and is a very notable swerve away from the company&#8217;s acquisitions in recent years, which have included a majority stake in Turkey&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rollic for $228 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peak</a> for $2.1 billion, 80% of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/zynga-to-acquire-small-giant-games-the-maker-of-empires-puzzles-for-700m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Giant Games</a> for $718 million; and Gram Games for $299 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix said on Wednesday it will roll out 41 Indian films and shows this year, its biggest annual roster of Indian content to date, as the American giant makes further push to win subscribers in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The streaming giant, which committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/netflix-earmarks-420m-to-fight-disney-in-india/">spending about $420 million on locally produced Indian content</a> in 2019 and 2020, is this year spending significantly more on the new Indian catalog, which is three times larger than the past two years combined.</p>
<p>The new titles feature high-profile Indian actors and directors including Madhuri Dixit, Karan Johar, Manoj Bajpayee, R. Madhavan, Raveena Tandon, Neena Gupta, and Dhanush.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new roster includes “Bombay Begums,” which follows stories of five women across generations wrestling with desire, ethics, and personal crises, “Decoupled,” a comedy by writer Manu Joseph on India and marriage, and a second season of Emmy-winning drama “Delhi Crime.”</p>
<p>Also in the list are comedy specials that have become immensely popular on streaming services in India. Netflix said comedians including Sumukhi Suresh, Aakaash Gupta, Rahul Dua, and Prashasti Singh &#8212; all of whom have participated in comedy shows by Amazon Prime Video &#8212; will have shows on the streaming service this year.</p>
<p>Kota Factory (a still from which is pictured above), a show that debuted on YouTube about a group of students preparing to compete to get into the prestigious engineering colleges, will stream its second season on Netflix later this year. The Viral Fever, the producer of the show, had <a href="https://blog.unacademy.com/our-very-own-kota-factory-becomes-the-most-loved-web-series-of-2019-14d50df4481">collaborated with Indian edtech startup Unacademy</a>, for the first season of the show.</p>
<p>Dice Media’s “Little Things”, which also began its life as native advertisement for a few firms but has since grown into its own show, is getting a fourth season this year.</p>
<p>“Our upcoming lineup features more variety and diversity than we have seen before. From the biggest films and series, to gripping documentaries and reality, and bold comedy formats. We are taking our next big leap in India to bring you more than 40 powerful and irresistible stories from all corners of the country,” said Monika Shergill, Vice President of Content at Netflix India.</p>
<p>“This is just a taste of the films and series to come. We are so excited to share these rich and diverse stories from the best and brightest creators and talent from India to the world,” said Shergill.</p>

Madhavan and Surveen Chawla in a still from Netflix&#8217;s upcoming show &#8220;Decoupled.&#8221; (Netflix)</p></div></p>
<p>Netflix’s growing catalog in India comes as Bollywood, which churns out more movies than any other film industry, struggles to deliver big hits as theatres across the country report low footfall amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Last year, the Indian film industry <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/amazon-prime-video-to-globally-premiere-7-indian-movies-as-theaters-remain-closed/">began releasing some movies directly on streaming services</a> even as some key players are still resisting the idea.</p>
<p>Widely influential director and producer Karan Johar said at Netflix’s virtual press conference that streaming services are increasingly reaching the level of scale in India that the next “Kuch Kuch Hota Hai” &#8212; one of the biggest Indian blockbuster films, and also one directed by Johar &#8212; can release directly on Netflix.</p>
<p>Thanks to the availability of some of the world’s cheapest mobile data and proliferation of low-cost Android smartphones, more than half a billion Indians came online in the past decade, much of it in the last five years.</p>
<p>YouTube reaches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">more than 450 million internet users in India</a>, TechCrunch reported in January. (India’s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad corroborated the figure at a press conference last month.) Disney’s Hotstar has amassed over 30 million paying subscribers in India. Media consulting firm MPA estimates that Netflix has about 5 million subscribers in India, a figure that has grown in recent years as the streaming service inked a deal with India’s largest telecom operator Jio Platforms.</p>
<p>Netflix&#8217;s growing focus on India also comes at a time when New Delhi is getting more involved with the nature of content on on-demand streaming services. Until now Netflix and other streaming services have operated in India without having to worry too much about censorship. But that’s changing, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new rules announced by India last week</a>.</p>
<p>“The category classification of a content will take into account the potentially offensive impact of a film on matters such as caste, race, gender, religion, disability or sexuality that may arise in a wide range of works, and the classification decision will take account of the strength or impact of their inclusion,” the new rules state.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/amazon-issues-rare-apology-in-india-over-drama-series/">issued a rare apology to viewers in India</a> on Tuesday after some people &#8212; including lawmakers with governing Bhartiya Janata Party &#8212; objected to some scenes from its political mini-series &#8220;Tandav.&#8221; Netflix, itself, has faced some heat, too. A police case was filed against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/police-case-filed-against-netflix-executives-in-india-over-a-suitable-boy-kissing-scene/">two top executives of Netflix</a>, including Shergill, after some people objected to scenes of the show &#8220;A Suitable Boy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sometimes the smallest innovations can have the biggest impacts on the world&#8217;s efforts to stop global climate change. Arguably, one of the biggest contributors in the fight against climate change to date has been the switch to the humble LED light, which has slashed hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions simply by reducing energy consumption in buildings.</p>
<p>And now firms backed by Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Gates are joining investors like Amazon and iPod inventor Tony Fadell to pour money into a company called <a href="https://turntide.com/">Turntide Technologies</a> that believes it has the next great innovation in the world&#8217;s efforts to slow global climate change &#8212; a better electric motor.</p>
<p><a href="https://ironman.fandom.com/wiki/Arc_Reactor#:~:text=The%20Arc%20Reactor%20was%20a,as%20it%20kept%20on%20improving.">It&#8217;s not as flashy as an arc reactor</a>, but like light bulbs, motors are a ubiquitous and wholly unglamorous technology that have been operating basically the same way since the nineteenth century. And, like the light bulb, they&#8217;re due for an upgrade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Turntide’s technology and approach to restoring  our planet will directly reduce energy consumption,” said Steve Levin, the co-founder (along with Downey Jr. ) of <a href="https://www.footprintcoalition.com/">FootPrint Coalition Ventures</a>. </span></p>
<p>The operation of buildings is responsible for 40% of CO2 emissions worldwide, Turntide noted in a statement. And, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), one-third of energy used in commercial buildings is wasted. Smart building technology adds an intelligent layer to eliminate this waste and inefficiency by automatically controlling lighting, air conditioning, heating, ventilation and other essential systems and Turntide&#8217;s electric motors can add additional savings.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why investors have put over $100 million into Turntide in just the last six months.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1938237" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1938237" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1938237" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-696695776.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-696695776.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-696695776.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-696695776.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-696695776.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-696695776.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-696695776.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-696695776.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-696695776.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1938237" class="wp-caption-text">PARIS, FRANCE &#8211; JUNE 16: Tony Fadell Inventor of the iPod and Founder and former CEO of Nest attends a conference during Viva Technology at Parc des Expositions Porte de Versailles on June 16, 2017 in Paris, France.

<p>The company, led by chief executive and chairman Ryan Morris is commercializing technology that was developed initially at the Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Turntide&#8217;s basic innovation is a software controlled motor, or switch reluctance motor, that uses precise pulses of energy instead of a constant flow of electricity. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a conventional motor you are continuously driving current into the motor whatever speed you want to run it at,&#8221; Morris said. &#8220;We’re pulsing in precise amounts of current just at the times when you need the torque… It&#8217;s software defined hardware.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>The technology spent eleven years under development, in part because the computing power didn&#8217;t exist to make the system work, according to Morris.</p>
<p>Morris was initially part of an investment firm called Meson Capital that acquired the technology back in 2013, and it was another four years of development before the motors were actually able to function in pilots, he said. The company spent the last three years developing the commercialization strategy and proving the value in its initial market &#8212; retrofitting the heating ventilation and cooling systems in buildings that are the main factor in the built environment&#8217;s 28% contribution to carbon dioxide emissions that are leading to global climate change.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission is to replace all of the motors in the world,&#8221; Morris said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He estimates that the technology is applicable to 95% of where electric motors are used today, but the initial focus will be on smart buildings because it&#8217;s the easiest place to start and can have some of the largest immediate impact on energy usage. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The carbon impact of what we’re doing is pretty massive,&#8221; Morris told me last year. &#8220;The average energy reduction [in buildings] has been a 64% reduction. If we can replace all the motors in buildings in the US that’s the carbon equivalent of adding over 300 million tons of carbon sequestration per year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Downey Jr.&#8217;s Footprint Coalition, and Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures and the real estate and construction focused venture firm Fifth Wall Ventures have joined the Amazon Climate Fund, Tony Fadell&#8217;s Future Shape, BMW&#8217;s iVentures fund and a host of other investors in backing the company.</p>
<p>The company has raised roughly $180 million in financing including the disclosure today of an $80 million investment round, which closed in October.</p>
<p>Buildings are clearly the current focus for Turntide, which only yesterday announced the acquisition of a small Santa Barbara, Calif.-based building management software developer called Riptide IO. But there&#8217;s also an application in another massive industry &#8212; electric vehicles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Two years from now we will definitely be in electric vehicles,&#8221; Morris said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our technology has huge advantages for the electric vehicle industry. There’s no rare earth minerals. Every EV uses rare earth minerals to get better performance of their electric motors,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;They&#8217;re expensive, destructive to mine and China controls 95 percent of the global supply chain for them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not use any exotic materials, rare earth minerals or magnets.. We&#8217;re replacing that with very advanced software and computation. It&#8217;s the first time Moore’s law applies to the motor.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation has taken the enterprise world by storm, by providing a set of tools for those doing repetitive, volume-based tasks to use software to remove some of that labor to let those people focus on more complicated tasks. Today a startup that&#8217;s taken some of that ethos and is applying it to more individualized work &#8212; that of salespeople &#8212; is announcing some funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dooly.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dooly</a>, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup that has built a set of AI-based tools that automate the busywork that goes into updating data in their sales software, and namely Salesforce &#8212; has picked up $20 million in funding to build out its business, which to date has picked up a number of customers among the sales teams of enterprise-focused software companies. They <a href="https://www.dooly.ai/resources/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> Airtable, Asana, Intercom, Contentful, Vidyard, BigCommerce, Liftoff and CrowdRiff.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Its aim is to make sales software more useful for salespeople by eliminating the work that goes into inputting data into those systems.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Really they’ve just created a mountain of virtual filing cabinets,&#8221; Kris Hartvigsen, Dooly&#8217;s founder and CEO, said in an emailed interview with me. &#8220;Filing cabinets just wait for drawers to be opened &#8212; or in the case of enterprise software, reports to be pulled and data to be input. We know people are capturing information across the business and our job is to make sure that the people and systems across the business have a better, faster, more far-reaching way of staying informed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The funding is being announced today, but it was actually raised in two tranches that had not previously been disclosed. A $3.3 million seed round was led by boldstart ventures and also included BoxGroup. Its $17 million Series A, meanwhile, was led by Addition, with boldstart and BoxGroup again participating, along with Battery Ventures, Mantis (representing musicians The Chainsmokers), and SV Angel.</p>
<p>Alongside the VCs, there are a number of interesting strategic individual investors, too. Daniel Dines and Brandon Deer of UIPath (the RPA connection clearly is not one that I&#8217;m imagining!); Allison Pickens, the ex-COO Gainsight; Zander Lurie of SurveyMonkey); Jay Simons, ex-CEO of Atlassian); Harry Stebbings, and other unnamed investors are all also involved. Ed Sim of Boldstart is joining Dooly’s board of directors with this announcement.</p>
<p>The challenge that Dooly has been built to solve is that while there are a lot of tools out there now to help salespeople source leads, manage the progress of their sales, give them advice and other helpful material to supplement their charm and the basic strength of a product, manage customers once they&#8217;ve signed on, and so on, all of them still require something important to work: a time commitment from salespeople to keep them updated with information. Ironically, the more tools to help them that are built, the more time salespeople need to spend feeding them data.</p>
<p>Even more ironically, one of the big daddies of the problem &#8212; the somewhat overweight Salesforce &#8212; has published figures (cited by Dooly) that say salespeople spend just 34% of their time selling. The rest (minus trips to get coffee to stay caffeinated) seems to be about data entry.</p>
<p>The idea with Dooly is that you turn it on, connect it to what you are using &#8212; starting with Salesforce &#8212; and Dooly lets you make notes which it then organises and puts into the right places in the rest of your apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a salesperson starts using <span class="il">Dooly</span>, the &#8216;aha moment&#8217; is pretty immediate,&#8221; Hartvigsen said. &#8220;Whether they want to do quick pipeline edits or push their notes to Salesforce, we don’t ask the user to learn any new patterns they aren’t familiar with, we just automate a bunch of things they hate doing, often comparing those traditional chores to clerical work.&#8221; For example, he notes, when they sync a note, Dooly automatically updates any Salesforce with any contacts found in the meeting, update fields, add in to-do’s, log activities, push messages to the appropriate internal stakeholders on Slack, all in the same motion.</p>
<p>The product currently also integrates with <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Slack, G-Cal, and G-Drive, because, Hartvigsen said, &#8220;we see this as an area where there is the most immediate friction and an area that was in need of disruption.&#8221; He added that the plans is to add more integrations over time. &#8220;We see need to expand the solutions that anchor to our connected workspace, with our near-term focus being the systems that touch revenue teams,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The design of Dooly seems to be about investing a little in order to save more. On average people are using Dooly between 2.5 and 5 hours each day, but <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hartvigsen </span>claims that right now the system helps people make up for more hours each week in lost productivity. Its pricing starts at $25 per user per month, going up depending on features and use.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are quite literally thousands of products out in the market today, and among them hundreds of strong ones, being built to help salespeople with different aspects of getting their jobs done. I&#8217;ve written about quite a few of them, and I&#8217;ve actually asked companies about whether they are tackling the very issue that Dooly has identified and is trying to fix.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They weren&#8217;t, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they won&#8217;t. Chief among them are companies like UiPath and Salesforce, which sit on different sides of this problem and could well move into it as they keep growing. (Having UiPath as a backer by way of its founder and a senior executive points to a relationship there, which is interesting.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the meantime, there have been some other interesting innovations using AI to improve the sales process, with companies like Pipedrive, Clari, Seismic, Chorus.ai and Gong all using natural language, machine learning, and big data analytics (itself helped by AI) to improve how sales get done.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The first thing we noticed when we met the Dooly team was the thoughtful design first approach to product that engendered tons of customer love. This love was inherent not only on popular ratings sites like G2 Crowd but also in the individual usage and viral adoption throughout companies with only one initial user,” said Ed Sim, Founder and Managing Partner at boldstart ventures in a statement. “Dooly is revolutionizing the note-taking experience for customer facing end users from sales to customer success to product.”</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"></li>
</ul>
<p>“Dooly is relentlessly focused on building a user-first experience for its customers to seamlessly create workflows and unlock new revenue opportunities,” said Lee Fixel, Founder of Addition, added. “We are thrilled to support Dooly as it continues to scale and enhance the sales function for more businesses.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When merchants launch their e-commerce businesses, they can easily manage the end-to-end operations in the early stages. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as they begin to grow, managing their own operations, from warehousing and logistics to delivery and cash collection, can become difficult. This</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can prevent them from scaling </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite having a steady inflow of demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, there&#8217;s a need to offload some of this workload. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where e-commerce fulfillment services come in handy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://www.flextock.com/">Flextock</a>, one such company providing this service to businesses and consumers in Egypt, is announcing that it is part of Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2021 batch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Founded by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-mossaad-50903438">Mohamed Mossaad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/enas-siam-18150115/">Enas Siam</a> in September 2020, the Egyptian company launched in stealth this January.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to COO Siam, the founders noticed that as e-commerce activities in the Middle East and North African regions accelerated due to the pandemic, merchants </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overwhelmed with the volume of orders they received</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We saw it as an opportunity to build a tech-enabled platform to be able to help anyone that wanted to grow their own independent brand or store,&#8221; she told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted them to focus on their products and marketing while leaving the supply chain and logistics bit to us, which we do through our end-to-end proprietary software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mossaad, the company&#8217;s CEO, describes Flextock as a tech-enabled fulfillment provider. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When merchants sign up to the platform, they send their products to one of the company&#8217;s fulfillment centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Flextock takes the whole catalog and tags the products for tracking purposes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, integration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Flextock and any online store they use, be it Shopify, WooCommerce, Wix and Odoo, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As orders </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Flextock packages and ships the products from the fulfillment center to the customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock doesn&#8217;t own any delivery vehicles, so to achieve this, the company partners with existing logistics companies in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model has helped the startup to create a marketplace for different last-mile delivery companies in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120227" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120227" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120227 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="174" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg 1480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=300,77 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=768,196 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=680,174 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flextock-Product.jpg?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120227" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flextock</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also a dashboard for these merchants to track each order, get more visibility into their shipping process and know how well their products sell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flextock makes money on a per-order basis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means the merchants on the platform pay a flat fee that changes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with respect to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the volume of products moved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mossaad says that since the company beta launched in January with more than 20 businesses, it has been growing 50% week-on-week</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across 28 cities in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the CEO, Flextock is the first end-to-end fulfillment service in Egypt. And in a market that will likely see more competition in the next couple of years, Mossaad thinks Flextock has the opportunity to become the market leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind this rationale is that the six-month-old startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/22989">backed by Y Combinator</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has also raised $850,000 which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first part of its multi-million-dollar pre-seed round that will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> close</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometime this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were able to very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">get the acceptance of YC given the size of the opportunity we are focused on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We believe that commerce is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to change in the Middle East and Africa, and Flextock is going to be at the forefront of powering this next generation of commerce,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders combine a wealth of corporate experience and a strong track record of scaling tech startups in the MENA region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120228" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120228" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2120228 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GAD00901-1280x971-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="516" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GAD00901-1280x971-1.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GAD00901-1280x971-1.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GAD00901-1280x971-1.jpg?resize=300,228 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GAD00901-1280x971-1.jpg?resize=768,583 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GAD00901-1280x971-1.jpg?resize=680,516 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GAD00901-1280x971-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120228" class="wp-caption-text">L-R: Mohamed Mossaad (CEO) and Enas Siam (COO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siam started her career managing supply operations at Nestle across the Middle East and North Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, she became the General Manager of Careem Bus, a mass-transit service and Uber subsidiary, where she helped build the product from scratch and grew it to 150,000 monthly rides in a year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mossaad, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has worked on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turnarounds across different African countries during his time at Bain &amp; Company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He joined Egyptian online food delivery platform, Elmenus, as Chief Strategy Officer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He helped scale the company&#8217;s revenues 5x in less than a year and was instrumental to its $8 million Series B round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO says Flextock has its sights on other African and Middle Eastern markets &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Saudi Arabia &#8212; and the plan is to provide its services to over 1 million businesses in these regions over the next decade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are on a mission to enable more than 1 million merchants in Africa and the Middle East to sell online without carrying out the hassle of running their own operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are well-positioned to do that, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hopefully,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we will be able to achieve that in a record time.&#8221;</span></p>
