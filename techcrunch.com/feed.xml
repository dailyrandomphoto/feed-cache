										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/panasonic/">Panasonic</a> has confirmed a data breach after hackers gained access to its internal network.</p>
<p>Panasonic said in <a href="https://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2021/11/en211126-4/en211126-4.html">a press release dated November 26</a> that its network was “illegally accessed by a third party” on November 11 and that “some data on a file server had been accessed during the intrusion.”</p>
<p>The Osaka, Japan-based company didn’t provide any further details, but Japanese news outlet <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/kansai-news/20211126/2000054345.html">NHK</a> reports that hackers managed to access sensitive data including information on the company’s partners, personal details related to customers and employees, and technical files from the company’s domestic operations. The report also claims that the as-yet-unknown threat actors had access to the company’s server for more than four months, from June 22 to November 3, before Panasonic detected abnormal network activity earlier this month.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Panasonic spokesperson Jim Wickizer did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>In its press release, the company said that in addition to conducting its own investigation, it’s “currently working with a specialist third-party organization to investigate the leak and determine if the breach involved customers&#8217; personal information and/or sensitive information related to social infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>“After detecting the unauthorized access, the company immediately reported the incident to the relevant authorities and implemented security countermeasures, including steps to prevent external access to the network,&#8221; it added. “Panasonic would like to express its sincerest apologies for any concern or inconvenience resulting from this incident.”</p>
<p>News of this data breach comes less than a year after Panasonic India was hit with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack that saw hackers leak 4 gigabytes of data, including financial information and email addresses. It also comes amid a wave of cyberattacks targeting Japanese technology companies. NEC and Mitsubishi Electric both fell victim to hackers last year, and Olympus was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">recently forced to suspend its European, Middle East and Africa operations</a> after being hit by BlackMatter ransomware.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The second annual <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638118879937000&amp;usg=AOvVaw17g372ebpuaAB7cJWWACsv">Sight Tech Global</a> happens this week, on December 1-2, and this free, virtual event is incredibly packed with insights about how rapid advances in technology are fostering an accessibility revolution for people who are blind or have low vision. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638118879937000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0aM95a8o-S9tKNUaMBC-m0">Register today</a>.</p>
<p>All the sessions have been pre-recorded, and I can tell you first-hand that the panels and fireside chats are really remarkable, whether or not tech accessibility is your area. Join our host Will Butler, VP of Be My Eyes, for two incredibly thought-provoking mornings on Dec. 1-2 starting at 8 a.m. PT. Here’s <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638118879937000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1o4OGyELBtKDFCH_mPnMn4">the agenda</a> and my quick take on the 10 sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple: </strong>A top Apple researcher explains how the cascade of ML/ AI  features (image description, gesture control, scene description) fit together in a customizable accessibility “stack.”</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Alexa: </strong>Alexa’s top AI thinker discusses how Amazon is becoming a more conversational and helpful assistant that talks less and does more.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Seeing AI:</strong> The co-founder explains his vision for how to augment navigation for the blind with customizable audio AR.</li>
<li><strong>Website accessibility 2.0:</strong> There is a little-known technical reason why website accessibility is a costly undertaking. That’s about to change.</li>
<li><strong>Indoor Navigation</strong>: Four of the world’s top researchers discuss how new technologies like LiDAR are the foundation to solve this really difficult problem for blind mobility.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomous Taxis</strong>: When will they go commercial and will they work well for the blind and visually impaired? A top AI researcher says not soon; Waymo begs to differ.</li>
<li><strong>Inventors</strong>: Products designed to aid blind people have a way of going mainstream. Think OCR reading machines. These tree inventors are taking their shots.</li>
<li><strong>Getting to accessible</strong>. When and how do product companies reach the finish line. Hear from Spotify and Peloton, which take that on. It’s not easy.</li>
<li><strong>Blind Kindle</strong>: Multi-line Braille displays that can also render tactile graphics are the “Holy Braille” of information appliances. APH shows off its AI-powered prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong>: 75% of mobile users are on Android, and Google’s Lookout app is essential for the blind Android users. The Lookout team is making the most of Google’s accessibility commitment and AI resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re still hungry for more, there are seven, live breakout sessions that go into deeper detail on some of the topics on the main stage as well as new subjects.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>

					<description><![CDATA[No, the secular shift to online shopping will not reverse. But it is also seemingly reverting to slower growth rates.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce has been on a tear. Lockdowns, a move to remote work and other impacts of COVID pushed a great number of global citizens to spend more of their money online through e-commerce sites and on-demand services.</p>
<p>For companies like Shopify, the period since March 2020 has proven a bonanza. The Canadian e-commerce giant spent last March bouncing between $350 and $420 per share. Today, the company is worth $1,554.74 per share.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Other players saw their businesses scale as consumers spent more time buying online and less time in stores. Instacart&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/are-rivals-snacking-on-instacarts-core-grocery-delivery-market/">grocery delivery business accelerated</a>.

<h2>Black Friday and earnings warnings</h2>
<p>While I despise astroturfed holidays that revolve around shopping, they can provide useful data points. You will not be shocked that Black Friday was a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/27/black-friday-shopping-in-stores-drops-28percent-from-pre-pandemic-levels.html">bit of a bust</a> in terms of U.S. retail foot traffic. New COVID variants will do that, frankly.</p>
<p>But it may surprise you that <em>online</em> shopping as part of the Black Friday fauxliday <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/28/22806233/black-friday-online-spending-decreased-first-time">fell</a> compared to 2020 levels. Not that the declines were severe, but seeing online spending drift to $8.9 billion this year from $9.0 billion last year made me sit up and take note.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should not have been surprised. There were warning signs.</p>
<p>Shopify&#8217;s Q3 earnings, <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shopify-announces-third-quarter-2021-financial-results">reported October 28, 2021</a>, were a letdown. The company&#8217;s posted revenues of $1.12 billion <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/shopify-shop-q3-earnings-miss-163804665.html">missed estimates</a>, despite posting 46% year-over-year growth. Earnings per share and gross merchandise volume <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shopify-stock-shopify-earnings-q32021/">also missed</a> analyst guesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chegg, the NYSE listed student media learning platform is acquiring <a href="http://Busuu.com">Busuu</a>, the online language learning startup established in Europe in 2008, for approximately $436 million (€385 million) in an all-cash transaction.</p>
<p>At its exit Busuu had raised only $16.1m in total, a tiny amount even I in European terms, and testament to the sheer grit of the founders who, by the end, had built a business that had reached over 120 million learners to date across more than 160 countries. Busuu provides courses in 12 different languages to over 500,000 paying subscribers.</p>
<p>The company’s last funding round was May 27, 2020 for $2m from GP Bullhound and ultra-high net worths. Prior to that the previous investors had consisted of Harold Primat, McGraw-Hill Education, PROfounders Capital, Martin Varsavsky and Johann &#8220;Hansi&#8221; Hansmann (according to CrunchBase).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dan Rosensweig, President and CEO of Chegg said: “The addition of Busuu gives Chegg the unique opportunity to expand our business while also adding tremendous value to our existing users. It will allow us to drive further into international markets, as well as accelerate Busuu’s growth in the US market. Busuu’s team, who we have known for many years, are a great cultural fit. They have built an incredible learning service for the serious language learner, and we are excited to have them as part of Chegg.”</p>
<p>Chegg says it expects Busuu’s full-year 2021 revenue to be approximately $45 million with year-over-year growth of greater than 20%. The $17 billion digital language market is expected to triple in size in the next five years, said a statement by Chegg.</p>
<p>Founded in 2008 by Bernhard Niesner and Adrian Hilti, with offices in London, UK, and Madrid, Spain, Busuu has made a point of finessing its language-learning model and iterating every aspect of the platform, to the point where a study by ann academic at the University of Maryland, showed that users of Busuu needed only 13 hours of study in a two-month period to move up one college semester (typically 90-105 hours of instruction). The company offers free and paid subscriptions on a monthly, annual, and bi-annual basis.</p>
<p>Busuu is used by individuals but also offers corporate language training. Last year it added live language tutoring after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/language-platform-busuu-acquires-video-tutor-startup-now-plans-ipo/">acquiring</a> Verbling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bernhard Niesner, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Busuu, said: “We are proud and excited to be joining the Chegg family, a world-leading edtech company that puts students first. This partnership will give us an opportunity to leverage Chegg’s tremendous reach to fuel our expansion, particularly in the US. Our vision is to empower everyone in the world through languages, and we believe our relationship with Chegg will enable us to achieve this goal even faster.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stellantis, the global corporation formed through a merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and French automaker Groupe PSA, signed a binding agreement with a lithium producer as more automakers look to secure key parts of the battery supply chain. The agreement is one in a flurry of deals between automakers and suppliers as the demand for EVs rises.</p>
<p>Vulcan Energy Resources will produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide from a brine project in the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany. Generally, lithium is produced either via hard rock mining or from brine deposit extraction. While both have environmental drawbacks, Vulcan’s site will use renewable geothermal energy to power the lithium extraction process.</p>
<p>The project will also re-inject the spent brine in a closed-loop cycle, leaving no residual waste, such as production tailings. The project in Germany will use a fraction of water and land compared to other brine projects, such as those found in South America – which means a smaller carbon footprint and potentially a lower operational expenditure, the German-Australian company added on its website.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240118" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Under the five-year supply agreement, Vulcan will send shipments of lithium extracted in Germany to Stellantis beginning in 2026. Over the lifetime of the deal, Vulcan will supply between 81,000 metric tons and 99,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide to the automaker. The two companies did not disclose financial terms of the deal, but it’s subject to both the commencement of commercial operations at the extraction site and product qualification.</p>
<p>The deal is part of Stellantis’ sweeping electrification strategy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/">which it outlined in July</a>, that earmarks €30 billion ($35.5 billion) for EVs and new software over the next four years. The automaker aims to manufacture 130 gigawatt hours of battery capacity by 2025 and around 260 gigawatt hours across five factories in North America and Europe by 2030.</p>
<p>It’s the latest sign that global automakers are looking to secure their slice of finite raw materials like lithium, a key mineral in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has made similar investments in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/gm-is-investing-in-a-california-lithium-extraction-project/">California lithium extraction project</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">Tesla has inked its own supply deals</a> for minerals like nickel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Renault signed its own agreement with Vulcan last week for up to 32,000 metric tons of European-made lithium.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies today want to avoid the lock-in they faced in the past with a single vendor. As a result, they are hedging their bets with a multi-cloud strategy, but this creates a new problem around finding a single tool for managing it all. That&#8217;s where <a href="http://upbound.io/">Upbound</a> comes in with its open source <a href="https://crossplane.io/">Crossplane</a> multi-cloud management tool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big problem, and up until now, companies have relied on the cloud vendors themselves to manage each one separately. While some solutions like Google Anthos and Red Hat OpenShift have come along, there was a lack of open source tooling until Upbound released Crossplane in May 2020.</p>
<p>Investors recognized the need identified by Upbound and rewarded the company with a $60 million Series B to help build the open source project while looking to grow the commercial version of the product. Altimeter Capital led the round with participation from GV, Intel Capital and Telstra Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240024" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Upbound founder and CEO Bassam Tabbara said that while the market has attempted to find a solution to this management challenge, he believes that his company is the first to build an open source community with the hope of developing this single management console and single API to manage across cloud tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of efforts around trying to build a single point of control. None of them have attacked this problem from a community perspective, creating a universal control plane that enables that in [a] community, while [building] the convergence around it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of Crossplane as the first to get to a point where we actually now have a convergence effect around a single universal cloud API. This has never happened before. It&#8217;s truly the first time that we&#8217;ve gotten to one. You can go to Crossplane right now and you get one declarative API that can be used to address all cloud resources and infrastructure sources across all vendors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tabbara points out that the project is fully cloud-native and is managed under the umbrella of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which manages Kubernetes and other key open source cloud-native technologies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that Crossplane allows users to pick and choose the cloud vendors they want to use &#8212; whether cloud infrastructure vendors like AWS, Microsoft and Google or cloud-native tooling like Elastic, Confluent, Databricks and Snowflake &#8212; and manage all of that from a single API.</p>
<p>The company has grown and helped nurture the open source project and developed a commercial product in parallel called Upbound (like the company), which customers can install themselves in their cloud of choice or use a SaaS version that Upbound will manage for them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only catching on with users. Tabbara said he has also been seeing major vendors like AWS, Azure, Equinix and IBM building integrations for Crossplane. He believes this is key, and it&#8217;s similar to the dynamic<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/kubernetes-gains-momentum-as-big-name-vendors-join-cloud-native-computing-foundation/"> we saw in 2017</a> when the major cloud players began to rally around Kubernetes and the CNCF.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s truly to the point where there is now a real convergence effect around Crossplane, not unlike the convergence effect that we saw around Kubernetes as a project, and not unlike the convergence we saw around Linux as a project,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It seems to be a project and a commercial vision with tremendous potential, one that investors see as a pivotal piece of the cloud puzzle and are willing to pour in significant capital to help build. If Upbound can execute on this vision, it may be onto something truly transformative, but only time will tell if they can make that happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Francisco Partners <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearlake-capital-to-buy-quest-software-from-francisco-partners-11638140400">bought Quest Software in 2016</a> when Dell was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/dell-needs-to-decide-what-to-keep-and-what-to-sell-after-emc-deal/"> selling off some assets</a> to help pay for the massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/dell-buys-emc-for-67b-in-largest-deal-in-tech-history/">$67 billion EMC deal</a>. Dell itself had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/02/dell-acquires-quest-software-for-2-4-billion/">purchased Quest in 2012</a> for $2.4 billion. Today, the company was on the move again, with Clearlake Capital picking it up this time.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearlake-capital-to-buy-quest-software-from-francisco-partners-11638140400"> The Wall Street Journal</a>, the firm bought Quest for $5.4 billion. Reuters<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dellsoftware-m-a-franciscopartners-idUSKCN0Z609F"> reported in 2016</a> that Francisco and Elliot Management paid around $2 billion for Quest and another asset, SonicWALL. If all of these figures are accurate, Francisco made a nice little profit off of its 2016 investment and managed to nurture the company to more than double its value. It&#8217;s worth noting that the parties have not officially acknowledged the price.</p>
<p>While a private company doesn&#8217;t have to reveal its financials, it seems likely that Quest has been doing pretty well since the 2016 transaction. Perhaps even more revealing is that Clearlake has decided to retain CEO Patrick Nichols and his entire management team.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240071" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Quest is your classic legacy security vendor. The company was founded in 1987 and has been shuffled between owners, modernizing along the way and managing to continually stay alive and increase in value.</p>
<p>Dipanjan “DJ” Deb, co-founder and CEO at Francisco Partners, is justifiably proud of building Quest into a more valuable property under its stewardship.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a long and successful track record executing divisional carve-out transactions and are grateful to have had the opportunity to work with the Quest team to create value for the company, its customers and its partners,&#8221; Deb said in a statement about the deal.</p>
<p>The company has built up a stable of security products, including identity products One Identity and OneLogin. It also offers an endpoint solution and a Microsoft-focused security product, among other products and services. Clearlake certainly liked the broad portfolio and customer base that Quest is bringing to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With a robust portfolio of market-leading software and SaaS solutions alongside a rich history of product innovation, we believe Quest is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging growth trends in identity-centric cybersecurity, data intelligence and IT operations management software markets,” Clearlake&#8217;s Prashant Mehrotra and Paul Huber said in a statement.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close early next year pending standard regulatory approval.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online marketplace eBay is further investing in its sneaker business with <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-acquires-sneaker-con-authentication-business/">today&#8217;s news</a> that it&#8217;s acquiring <a href="https://sneakercon.com/">Sneaker Con Digital&#8217;s</a> authentication business, which verifies the authenticity of high-value footwear. The business has operations in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and Germany, and had been previously working with eBay to vet the sneakers being bought and sold on its platform.</p>
<p>Sneakers have become a large category on eBay&#8217;s marketplace, where today there are over 1.9 million pairs available to buy every day.</p>
<p>In October 2020, eBay launched an &#8220;Authenticity Guarantee&#8221; service in partnership with Sneaker Con, whose team of experts would verify the sneakers at no cost to sellers before items were shipped to the buyers. If the buyer then returns the sneakers, the authenticators would inspect them again before they&#8217;re sent back to the seller. This multi-point inspection system involves checking various aspects of the shoes in question, including the sizing, labels, stitching, logos, heel tabs, laces, and more, and even the box itself.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240068" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When the shoes were verified, the left sneaker is given an NFC-enabled tag that provides more detailed information about the sneakers&#8217; authenticity when scanned. Verifiable listings also receive a blue check mark next to the item. The service was available for any sneaker over $100 being sold on eBay&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>Many buyers and sellers preferred to shop sneakers through eBay as they&#8217;d be able to see photos of the exact shoes they&#8217;d be getting, instead of stock photos, and there were fewer fees <a href="https://www.insider.com/ebay-sneakers-authenticity-guarantee-review">compared</a> with some rival sneaker marketplaces. Attracting this kind of buyer is also part of eBay&#8217;s larger strategy to drive enthusiasts to its site across various high-end categories, like handbags, watches, and sneakers, then benefit as they shop more items on eBay. The company recently <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/ebay-inc-ebay-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">noted</a> the average sneaker buyer on eBay spends approximately $2,000 in other categories, for example.</p>
<p>Ebay says its Authenticity Guarantee service led to quarter-over-quarter category growth and, in just over a year, it&#8217;s authenticated over 1.55 million sneakers worldwide.</p>
<p>In its Q3 2021 earnings, eBay also noted its U.S. sneaker business was healthy and growing at double-digit rates, and it was expanding to other markets, including Germany. The company additionally announced plans to invest in 3D image capability on sneaker listings that would allow buyers to interact with a 360-degree view of the item they&#8217;re purchasing, as another means of instilling buyer confidence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the acquisition, eBay is bringing its partnered authentication business in-house where it will continue to build on its offerings to accommodate resale market trends, the company said about today&#8217;s news. Deal terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>However, the deal is only for Sneaker Con&#8217;s authentication business &#8212; its events business will continue to operate separately. The deal was signed and closed on November 24, 2021, notes eBay.</p>
<p>&#8220;eBay has always been a vibrant community of enthusiasts, with deeply knowledgeable buyers, sellers and employees,&#8221; said Jordan Sweetnam, SVP and General Manager of eBay North America, in a statement. &#8220;We partnered with Sneaker Con to launch sneaker authentication on eBay last year because the team shared our passion for the category – with best-in-class capabilities to deliver what our customers want most. The response to our authentication offering has been overwhelming, and this acquisition allows us to continue to transform eBay and bring a higher level of trust and confidence to every transaction,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>With a holiday-impacted week behind us, we hope that you are ready for the next few weeks of busy news. Because starting in the back-half of December, the world is going to slow down dramatically. Make sure that you are <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">following the show on Twitter</a>, and let&#8217;s get into it!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240020" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>No tech IPOs this week, though we will see <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/17494/next-week-earnings-calendar-stocks">earnings from select SaaS companies</a>. That means that our information flow will slow over the next few days.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/27/22804830/starlink-india-not-to-subscribe-license">India is irked at Starlink</a>, telling the Elon Musk company to get its regulatory paperwork in order.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi is going public, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/11/27/personal-computer-maker-raspberry-pi-plans-london-listing/">it&#8217;s expected</a>. The micro-computer company could debut in Spring of 2022 on the London exchanges.</li>
<li>And black Friday online sales <a href="https://www.wtnh.com/top-stories/cyber-monday-set-to-make-new-record-as-black-friday-sales-decline/">dipped</a>, though we have a guess as to why.</li>
<li>Two acquisitions took place recently that caught our eye, including <a href="https://skift.com/2021/11/23/booking-holdings-to-buy-flights-partner-etraveli-group-for-1-8-billion/">Booking Holdings buying Etraveli Group for $1.8 billion</a>, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearlake-capital-to-buy-quest-software-from-francisco-partners-11638140400?mod=djemalertNEWS">Clearlake buying Quest from Francisco Partners</a>.</li>
<li>From the startup world, two deals: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/28/slice-220-million-fundraise-credit-card-challenger-india/">Slice is now a unicorn thanks to Tiger Global</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/thought-machine-series-c-unicorn/">Thought Machine is <em>also</em> now a unicorn</a> thanks to its own six-figure round.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-is-expected-to-step-down-sources-say.html">CNBC reported</a> this morning that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is expected to step down from his role at the social media company. Shortly after, Dorsey himself <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720">confirmed</a> the rumors and Twitter <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jack-dorsey-steps-down-as-twitter-ceo-board-unanimously-appoints-cto-parag-agrawal-as-successor-301432989.html">issued a press release</a> with more details. Parag Agrawal, who joined Twitter as an engineer in 2011 and has served as CTO since 2017, will take over as Dorsey&#8217;s successor.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being &#8216;founder-led,'&#8221; Dorsey wrote in an email to Twitter&#8217;s staff, which he also <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1465347002426867720%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2240050action%3Dedit">tweeted</a>. &#8220;Ultimately I believe that&#8217;s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I&#8217;ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorsey is the CEO of both Twitter and Square, a financial company that serves both consumer and corporate customers with payment, cash management and transference services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240050" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Twitter says Dorsey will remain on Twitter&#8217;s Board until his term expires at the 2022 meeting of stockholders. Alongside Dorsey&#8217;s departure, Bret Taylor, the president and COO of Salesforce, was named the new Chairman of the Board, succeeding Patrick Pichette who will remain on the Board and continue to serve as chair of the Audit Committee, the company said.</p>
<p>Dorsey points to Taylor&#8217;s addition to the board as one of the reasons he felt comfortable stepping down, noting Taylor &#8220;understands entrepreneurship, taking risks, companies at massive scale, technology, product, and he&#8217;s an engineer.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">not sure anyone has heard but,</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter said there are no changes to the company&#8217;s previously shared outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021, or its 2023 goals, as a result of these leadership changes.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s stock rose on the news that Dorsey may step down, trading up 6.1% as of the time of writing after giving up some early gains in the first minutes of the week&#8217;s trading cycle.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes, Twitter is worth around $40 billion today. No small number, to be clear, but less than half the value of Square, which has a public-market worth of just over $99 billion.</p>
<p>Running <em>one</em> public company is work. Running <em>two</em> is uncommon and, we presume, not a simple feat. Square shares are also trading higher this morning, albeit to a smaller degree. (Twitter has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-under-fire-from-activist-investor-2020-3">attracted investor dissent</a> for its CEO&#8217;s split time.) Square confirmed to TechCrunch there are no changes to Dorsey&#8217;s role there, nor anything else related to leadership, strategy, or financial outlook.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you all to know that this was my decision and I own it,&#8221; Dorsey wrote to his team. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t many founders that choose their company over their own ego. I know we&#8217;ll prove this was the right move.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My trust in Parag as Twitter&#8217;s CEO is deep,&#8221; he said, praising his successor in the issued statement. &#8220;His work over the past 10 years has been transformational. I&#8217;m deeply grateful for his skill, heart, and soul. It&#8217;s his time to lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his time at Twitter, Agrawal has been responsible for the company&#8217;s technical strategy and has led the work to improve development velocity. He also advanced the state of machine learning across Twitter. Prior to being appointed CTO, Parag was Twitter&#8217;s first Distinguished Engineer due to his work across revenue and consumer engineering, including his impact on the re-acceleration of audience growth in 2016 and 2017, the company said. The exec holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from <span class="xn-org">Stanford University</span> and a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the <span class="xn-org">Indian Institute of Technology</span>, <span class="xn-location">Bombay</span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to thank the Board for their confidence in my leadership and Jack for his continued mentorship, support, and partnership,&#8221; said Agrawal, in a statement. &#8220;I look forward to building on everything we have accomplished under Jack&#8217;s leadership and I am incredibly energized by the opportunities ahead. By continuing to improve our execution, we will deliver tremendous value for our customers and shareholders as we reshape the future of public conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also shared his email to Twitter&#8217;s team in a <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1465349749607854083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1465349749607854083%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2240050action%3Dedit">tweet</a>, noting that he&#8217;s committed to executing Twitter&#8217;s strategy and hitting its &#8220;ambitious goals,&#8221; but that the company will be challenged in how it works to execute its plans and deliver results. Twitter will have an all-hands meeting on Tuesday, with a Q&amp;A session for employees, he noted.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<h2>A great product run</h2>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s leadership and product direction have received criticism over the years for being too conservative or too slow &#8212; or both. In recent quarters, however, Twitter&#8217;s ability to develop and ship new products and services has accelerated.</p>
<p>Though Twitter&#8217;s functionality remained largely stagnant for years &#8212; save for some major changes like making tweets longer &#8212; the app has introduced a slew of new features and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Twitter entered the live audio race with Spaces, then introduced monetization features, like Ticketed Spaces, Tip Jar and livestream shopping (Meta apps like Facebook and Instagram have also picked up the pace when it comes to e-commerce). More recently, the platform launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">subscription Twitter Blue service</a>, which offers a more customizable user experience &#8212; including the ability to undo tweets &#8212; for $2.99 per month.</p>
<p>The social giant also opened its checkbook to bring more capabilities to its service. So far this year, Twitter has acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/twitter-acquires-threader-an-app-that-compiles-and-shares-threads/">companies like Threader</a> (which helped develop a thread reading experience for Twitter Blue), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/twitter-acquires-group-chat-app-sphere/">Sphere</a> (a group social messaging app), Breaker (which helped build Spaces), and, most notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a>, a newsletter platform that gives writers the convenience of linking their posts directly on their profile.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s no secret that Dorsey is interested in crypto &#8212; his Twitter bio is literally just &#8220;#bitcoin&#8221; &#8212; but he&#8217;s not the company&#8217;s only proponent. Twitter has been working on a way for users to display NFTs in their profile and, more broadly, Twitter houses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">Bluesky</a>, a decentralized web project. But Dorsey&#8217;s departure may not slow the momentum of Twitter crypto, especially after the company announced earlier this month that it will build a dedicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/twitter-is-building-a-crypto-team/">crypto team</a>. At the time, Twitter told TechCrunch that Agrawal would be working with the new crypto team on the future of crypto at Twitter, helping drive Twitter&#8217;s push toward decentralizing social media through blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The company did not immediately reply to a request for further comment about the news.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-plays-best-of-2021/">announced</a> the winners of its &#8220;<a href="https://play.google.com/bestof2021">Best of 2021</a>&#8221; app awards, which highlight both the company&#8217;s and users&#8217; picks for the best apps and games from the past year. This year, Google is expanding its awards lineup to include apps and games on tablets, Wear OS and Google TV, it says. Its U.S. winners included meditation app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elevatelabs.geonosis">Balance</a> as its app of the year and top game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite">Pokémon UNITE</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cbs.app">Paramount+</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dts.freefiremax">Garena Free Fire MAX</a> won the user&#8217;s choice awards.</p>
<p>In 2020, the award winners had reflected a world undergoing a pandemic, where stressed users had turned to apps and soothing games to relax &#8212; like top sleep app Loóna, which was last year&#8217;s &#8220;Best App,&#8221; or escapist games like winner Genshin Impact.</p>
<p>With the early days of the pandemic now behind us, some of this year&#8217;s award winners are apps that now focus on personal growth and creativity, instead of just relaxing or escaping. This, too, seems to reflect where we are as a society. Over this past year, we saw the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation">great resignation</a>&#8221; where U.S. employees voluntarily quit their unfulfilling, underpaid jobs in search of something better, and the creator economy began to boom as people pursued their passions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240026" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to Best of 2021 app Balance, which offers personalized meditation, other personal development-styled winners include <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moonly.android">Moonly</a>, an app for &#8220;harmonizing your life&#8221; with the lunar calendar; a &#8220;comedic relaxation&#8221; app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.launchpad.laughscape">Laughscape</a>; a hypnotherapy app for women, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clementine.clementineapp">Clementine</a>; better sleep app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northcube.sleepcycle">Sleep Cycle</a>; mentorship community <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mentorspaces">Mentor Spaces</a>; habit tracker and planner <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blu.rabito">Rabit</a>; and an app for navigating grief from loss, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.empathy.companion">Empathy</a>.</p>
<p>Other winners showcased how we adapted to pandemic life, as with audio chatroom <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clubhouse.app">Clubhouse</a>, tools for reducing screen time, like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cliffweitzman.speechify2">Speechify</a>, or those for reconnecting with nature, like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conceptivapps.blossom">Blossom</a>.</p>

<p>The year&#8217;s best games were led by top game Pokémon UNITE, which focused on cross-platform gaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pokémon Unite is Pokémon’s first strategic team battle game, co-developed by The Pokémon Company and TiMi Studio Group. We tried to distill the best parts of the MOBA genre to create a new kind of game, but I must admit that I was unsure if it would be well received by players around the world,&#8221; noted Masaaki Hoshino, Producer, Pokémon UNITE, in a statement. T&#8221;his award shows that our game has been positively received by fans and the media, and while this is a great relief, at the same time it reaffirms our determination to continue doing our best to make Pokémon UNITE an even more exciting experience that meets our players’ expectations,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The larger lineup also included indie experiences like the introspective <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GeorgeBatchelor.BirdAlone">Bird Alone</a>, which challenges you to become friends with the &#8220;loneliest bird in the world.&#8221; Annapurna Interactive&#8217;s Donut County won for its physics-based puzzle game, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">QR code ordering at restaurants has been around for years, but the pandemic increased<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/21/qr-codes-have-replaced-restaurant-menus-industry-experts-say-it-isnt-a-fad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its adoption as social distancing and hygiene measures went into place</a>. <a href="https://mryum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mr Yum</a>, a Melbourne-based mobile ordering and payments platform that was founded in 2018, announced today it has raised a $65 million USD Series A round, led by Tiger Global.</p>
<p>Other participants in the round included Commerce VC, VU Venture Partners, Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar and Kim Jackson through Skip Capital, San Antonio Spurs player Patty Mills and music group Rüfüs Du Sol. Returning investors included TEN13 and AirTree.</p>
<p>Mr Yum announced a $8 million USD post-seed round just seven months ago in April and its Series A brings its total funding so far to $74 million (about $103 million AUD).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240007" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in Melbourne, Mr Yum now has offices across Australia and in the United States and United Kingdom, too. Its clients include E.P. and L.P. and Strings of Life in Los Angeles, and Magic Mike Live Las Vegas and Sahara Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The startup says it has a total of more than 1,500 venues on its platform, including shopping centers, movie theaters and airports in addition to restaurants, and 13 million users. Over the past 18 months, its team has grown from 12 to more than 120 full-time staff, with teams in Los Angeles, London, Sydney, Brisbane and its Melbourne headquarters.</p>
<p>The company says that, based on <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase</a> data, this is the largest, this is is the third largest Series A in Australian history, and the largest Series A for an Australian female-led startup.</p>
<p>In an email, co-founder and CEO Kim Teo told TechCrunch that the startup’s goal is, “to build ‘the Shopify for restaurants.’” The company was first created because “menus hadn’t evolved in hundreds of years, consumers are visual and want to understand what they’re ordering,” she explained, “So Mr Yum was created with the simple idea of bringing menus to life with photos of every dish.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YJXUuzhTtU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/sunday-raises-100-million-for-its-fast-restaurant-checkout-flow/">Sunday raises $100 million for its fast restaurant checkout flow</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sunday raises $100 million for its fast restaurant checkout flow&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/sunday-raises-100-million-for-its-fast-restaurant-checkout-flow/embed/#?secret=YJXUuzhTtU" data-secret="YJXUuzhTtU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it expanded into mobile QR ordering, which Teo says eliminates administrative tasks like writing down orders, processing payments and splitting bills. She adds that restaurants using Mr Yum have increased their average order value by 20% to 40% and it has a monthly merchant churn rate of less than 0.5%.</p>
<p>“We made a big bet on QR codes early on,” Teo said. “We saw that QR code readers had been embedded into the iPhone camera about three months before we launched, so we took that as a signal they would become more widely used. Obviously QR codes are now commonplace and the past couple of years has saved us years of consumer education and any hesitation around them.”</p>
<p>Mr Yum began pitching its mobile ordering platform to businesses before the pandemic, but the pandemic has accelerated adoption.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has so drastically changed the mindset and adoption of technology for the hospitality and entertainment industries globally,” said Teo. She believes this change is permanent, because Mr Yum’s platform can make increase order sizes and also has marketing and customer analytic tools. These include a loyalty platform called Boomerang, which lets venues create gift vouchers, free item codes and dollar or percentage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240010" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240010" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2240010" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mr-Yum-team-April-21.jpg" alt="Mr Yum's team as of April 2021" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mr-Yum-team-April-21.jpg 6100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mr-Yum-team-April-21.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mr-Yum-team-April-21.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mr-Yum-team-April-21.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mr-Yum-team-April-21.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mr-Yum-team-April-21.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mr-Yum-team-April-21.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mr-Yum-team-April-21.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240010" class="wp-caption-text">Mr Yum&#8217;s team as of April 2021</p></div></p>
<p>Another way Mr Yum wants to be different from other QR ordering platforms is through integrations, which Teo calls its “bread and butter,” with partners like Impact Data, Sprout and Mailchimp. It also has more than 75 integrations with point-of-sale, marketing and payment providers, like Square, Toast and Deliverect. In terms of its payment features, Mr Yum has a partnership with Afterpay in the dining category, and also added a pay at table function to the platform so merchants have more flexibility in how they use the platform with their customers.</p>
<p>Mr Yum’s competitors vary by the geographic regions it operates in. Teo said Mr Yum will continue differentiating itself with product innovation, like Group Tabs and Advanced Batching, which combines separate orders to print together in kitchen bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>Mr Yum raised again just a few months after its post-seed round because “over the past few years, startup investment rounds have grown significantly in size and frequency. To become a market leader in a category and sustain this long term requires a lot of firepower,” she added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Particular Audience provides product discovery tools for retailers to offer personalization without compromising personal data.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Being in control of customer data is one of the ways retailers, like Amazon, Spotify and Netflix, are able to tap into consumer behavior and create customized experiences whenever a user logs in.</p>
<p>Those are some of the reasons Amazon, in particular, is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/788109/amazon-retail-market-share-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poised to grab 50% of the U.S. e-commerce market</a> this year, and why Sydney-based <a href="https://particularaudience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Particular Audience</a> wants to break down the data silos going on within e-commerce to give any retailer a chance to gather similar data on their customers to personalize experiences.</p>
<p>Particular Audience provides product discovery tools for retailers that are powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. In fact, the company wants to go further and offer personalization based on anonymity and without compromising personal data, CEO James Taylor told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239441" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Taylor launched Particular Audience in 2019 after taking a few years to work out the technology. The global pandemic threw a wrench in some plans, with Taylor and a handful of executives taking a pay cut so as to not have to let any employees go. However, with the e-commerce industry growing over the past 18 months, the company was able to get back to where it was, he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WWyqIVROi0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/getting-started-with-building-an-audience-in-the-creator-economy/">Getting started with building an audience in the creator economy</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The company has now amassed a real-time data set on product search, sales, pricing and availability from across the internet, from its browser plugin <a href="https://similarinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SimilarInc.com</a>, which gathers the data from its online shopper community without tracking or cookies. Retailers can analyze that data to tell them, for example, how better to promote high-margin or overstocked items.</p>
<p>“Data IP is the current frontier,” he said. “It is data that is going to improve predictions to personalize inventory and reduce waste while also helping with supply chain management. The goal is to create website data visibility that would benefit all of the other merchants other than Amazon.”</p>
<p>To continue developing its technology, the company secured $7.5 million in Series A funding in a round led by Equity Venture Partners and that included existing investors Carthona Capital and a group of angel investors. This latest investment gives the company $9.5 million in total funding raised to date, which includes $1.3 million in seed funding raised in 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Particular Audience is working with approximately 100 websites currently. In addition to Sydney, the company also has an office in London. Europe makes up more than 50% of Particular Audience’s global revenue, and the new funding enables the company to open a new office in Amsterdam next year.</p>
<p>North America is also a growth territory for the company, where it has already opened an office in Vancouver, with plans to open a New York office in 2022 as well. The company has 60 employees, up from 20 last year, and Taylor expects to add 40 more in the next year, including rounding out its leadership team with a head of product.</p>
<p>The funding will also be invested into building out an API-first product suite and retail media platform so retailers can gain a revenue stream from cost per clicks. Meanwhile, the company saw 460% year over year in revenue growth and expects to hit $100 million in gross merchandise value through its products this year, up 19 times in the last two years, Taylor said.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Daniel Szekely, partner at Equity Venture Partners, will join the board.</p>
<p>“Personalization of the internet is a critical frontier for e-commerce retailers, and in a world of growing online shopping options and diminishing consumer attention spans, delivering an experience that meets individual consumers’ needs is absolutely critical,” he said in a written statement. “James and his outstanding team have tackled this issue in a novel way, and the important need for their solution has been made obvious as the business gets pulled into multiple geographies. We’re thrilled to back them in their Series A and know this is just the beginning of the journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ability to purchase something at the point of discovery from digital content exists, but checkout technology company <a href="https://www.bolt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt</a> has the opportunity to give that its “one-click” treatment. It announced Monday that it made its first acquisition in <a href="https://tipser.co/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tipser</a>, a Swedish-based technology company enabling direct checkout on any digital surface.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Bolt is fresh off of raising <a href="https://www.bolt.com/blog/bolt-series-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$393 million in Series D funding</a> in October, bringing total capital raised to date to $600 million. And though the Tipser acquisition is in line with the company’s plans of what it wanted to do with the new capital, Ryan Breslow, founder and CEO of Bolt, told TechCrunch the deal “had been in the works for a while.”</p>
<p>Tipser’s technology enables consumers to purchase products natively from sites like online publications, mobile marketplaces, price comparison sites, social media platforms or search engines. The company is led by Marcus Jacobsson, co-founder and CEO, who started the company in 2012 with Axel Wolrath and Jonas Sjöstedt.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239530" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In fact, when Bolt initially began talking to Tipser, the company was not in a place to sell, and was actually working on their next investment round (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tipser/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they raised just over $14 million</a>), but the two companies ended up going into deeper conversations and found their cultural resonances worked better together, Breslow said.</p>
<p>“We saw how significant Tipser could be for Bolt,” he added. “They had been perfecting their embedded commerce technology for a decade and were the only formidable player. They were stronger than us in areas where we were weaker. It is very strategic to have them on our team.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As 2020 ends, new unicorn formation continues to impress&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/as-2020-ends-new-unicorn-formation-continues-to-impress/embed/#?secret=yurhjbIiXk" data-secret="yurhjbIiXk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Exact transaction figures were not disclosed, but Breslow did reveal to TechCrunch that the acquisition, which was an all-stock deal, came in “just shy of $200 million.” The entire Tipser team is staying put, so Bolt will be adding 100 more people to its team. Tipser’s presence in Sweden will now also serve as Bolt’s European headquarters to go with the company’s <a href="https://www.bolt.com/blog/bolt-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent announcement of expanding into Europe</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the acquisition, Bolt is launching Remote Checkout, a tool for shoppers to make a purchase from the exact point of discovery. Instead of seeing something on social media — where <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-shopping-and-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">84% of shoppers look for reviews</a>, according to Pew Research Center — then going to another website to make the purchase,</p>
<p>The new tool is one that Bolt was working on internally for over a year and was inspired by Instagram Checkout, also a tool where you can discover a product and check out directly from the app, Breslow said.</p>
<p>“With the death of tracking and cookies, we could see the need for native checkout so retailers can track conversion,” he added. “It’s better for consumers to not have to click a million things.”</p>
<p>Bolt’s Remote Checkout features include the direct one-click checkout, engagement with Bolt’s network of shoppers and the ability for merchants to boost conversion rates while receiving orders through multiple channels and building direct relationships with visitors. It also turns anonymous visitors into logged-in account holders and monetizes traffic on-site.</p>
<p>The added feature of publishers and creators being able to monetize traffic coming to their sites was one that Jason Wagenheim, president and CRO at media publisher BDG (formerly known as Bustle Digital Group), found particularly interesting. BDG’s brands include Bustle, EliteDaily and Fatherly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He was a bystander of sorts for the merger, having signed up with Tipser in January as the company’s first U.S. publisher, going live with the product in April on two of BDG’s 13 sites, Wagenheim said in an interview.</p>
<p>“What I love most about this acquisition is that we can accelerate the onboarding of hundreds of more merchants onto our platform,” he said. “This is a marriage of content and commerce.”</p>
<p>Before social media and companies like Bolt and Tipser, shopping directly from a magazine page meant utilizing QR codes, but that didn’t take off like people thought it would, Wagenheim said.</p>
<p>Other publishers tried to crack the code, and he noted Goop being one of the few able to do it. Now with these new technologies, any publisher or creator can close the gap between the upper and lower funnels and drive awareness because its commerce is shoppable and one click away.</p>
<p>He considers BDG’s project with Tipser still in the beta phase, but there are plans to roll out the technology on all of its sites next year. The company already had its audience engage in over 25 million sessions with people, on average, seeing 10 products per session, a metric Wagenheim says means the process is working: people are spending time with the products, are engaged and adding products to carts.</p>
<p>“With hundreds more merchants for editors to write about, and the one-click transaction happening, that is a game-changer,” he added.</p>

<p>The new funding follows an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/"> $83M Series B round last year</a> &#8212; when it described its market cap as “increasing healthily”.</p>
<p>The Series C is led by New York- and San Francisco-based Nyca Partners, with other new investors including ING Ventures, JPMorgan Chase Strategic Investments and Standard Chartered Ventures &#8212; the investment arms of some of its global tier one banking clients.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239972" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Thought Machine describes itself as a &#8220;cloud native core banking technology&#8221; firm &#8212; and is selling cloud-basked banking infrastructure to old and new banks as they look to offer their customers services via the cloud, moving away from mainframe, legacy banking tech (in the case of old school banks) or offering cloud-based services from the get-go in the case of challenger banks and fintech startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Series C follows a period of accelerated growth, with Thought Machine noting it&#8217;s added 200+ employees since 2020 and relocating into a larger London HQ to accommodate its expanded headcount.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to continue development and expansion of its flagship SaaS product Vault &#8212; a cloud-native platform which its b2b customers rely on to provide a range of retail banking services, from checking accounts, savings accounts, loans and credit cards to mortgages.</p>
<p>Vault is built around APIs, using a microservice architecture and a system of Smart Contracts &#8212; hosted on a cloud service of the customer&#8217;s choosing (the likes of Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and IBM Cloud are supported) &#8212; with touted benefits including increased flexible and more scalable infrastructure, as well as reduced running costs vs maintaining legacy technology.</p>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Paul Taylor, CEO and founder of Thought Machine said: &#8220;We are delighted to have earned the support of our new and existing investors as we continue to move the world’s leading banks into the cloud. We set out to eradicate legacy technology from the industry and ensure that all banks deployed on Vault can succeed and deliver on their ambitions. These new funds will accelerate the delivery of Vault into banks around the world who wish to implement their future vision of financial services.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Hans Morris, managing partner at Nyca Partners, added: &#8220;Thought Machine is the leading technology among the new generation of cloud native core platforms, and as a result it has become the top choice for tier one banks looking to upgrade their core architecture. These institutions tell us that Thought Machine’s engineering approach is unrivalled; Vault is highly configurable, flexible, scalable, and specifically designed for the complex environment and requirements of tier one banks. Investing in Thought Machine is an investment in the future of banking and we are very energized to be working with them as they build a new standard for core banking technology.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Nissan will invest 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) over the next five years developing new EVs and battery technology as part of a grand plan it calls &#8220;Ambition 2030,&#8221; the company <a href="https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/nissan-ambition-2030-vision-to-empower-mobility-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">announced</a>. It aims to release 15 new EVs total by 2030, with electrified vehicles making up half its vehicle lineup at that point.</p>
<p>The automaker said it will develop 23 electrified vehicles in total over the next eight years, with 20 of those coming in the next five years alone. It&#8217;s shooting for a market mix of 75 percent electrified (EV and e-Power PHEV/hybrids) in Europe, 55 percent in Japan and 40 percent in the US and China by 2030.</p>
<p>The other part of that mix, would presumably be internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. It&#8217;s worth noting that in early 2021, Nissan said that it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-wants-car-models-electric-203200601.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">planned to electrify</a> every all-new car it launches by the early 2030s. Presumably, then, any ICE vehicles still available would be legacy models.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvAjCAKmYEw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Nissan will launch EVs with all-solid-state batteries (ASSB) by 2028 and ready a pilot plant in Yokohama as early as 2024, it said. That technology promises benefits like reduced charging times, but has </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-14-dyson-ev-solid-state-batteries.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">yet</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to arrive to market as expected. The company also wants to bring the cost of battery packs down to $75 per kWh by 2028 with a reduction to $65 kWh further down the road. That would be about half of what EV batteries cost last year, according to </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-14/ev-battery-prices-risk-reversing-downward-trend-as-metals-surge" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. By 2030, Nissan hopes to be producing 130 GWh of batteries.</span></p>
<p>The company said it plans to expand its ProPilot driver assistance technology to over 2.5 million Nissan and Infiniti vehicles by 2026. It will also incorporate next-generation LIDAR systems &#8220;on virtually every new model by fiscal year 2030.&#8221;</p>

</figure>
<p>As part of Ambition 2030, Nissan also unveiled no less than four concept cars: the Chill-Out, Surf-Out, Hang-Out and Max-Out. Like most concepts, they&#8217;re meant to give a taste of Nissan&#8217;s future technology including self-driving, interior features and just far-out designs. However, Nissan has only shown <a href="https://global.nissannews.com/releases/release-0f1f4ed24f506b7f8039127912028dad/images/3a8d7e15c5730943b6daffe858312fa85a0e5837" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">images</a> of the Chill-Out as a real vehicle, with renders of the other three vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Chill-Out (top and above) is a smallish crossover that could be an early preview of the next-generation Leaf, which Nissan <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2025-nissan-leaf-become-compact-suv-third-generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">previously confirmed</a> would move from a hatch to a crossover style body. It will use the Ariya&#8217;s CMF-EV platform and e-4orce electric all-wheel drive system, and could arrive by 2025.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2F6d922e00-50fc-11ec-afbf-a948fb208dda&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=9956316dd79558130d9466319cc22f21875a73ce" alt="Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years" data-uuid="871e4ae0-5e05-347a-a3bc-bbd2bbfbdeb3" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div>
</figure>
<p>The Surf-Out, meanwhile, is a small electric single cab pickup with a decent-sized bed and removable canopy. It would come with a dual-motor AWD setup and a variety of power outputs, offering off-road performance, utility power and extended cargo space.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2F8d91dc50-50fc-11ec-bfde-c15f7bc38444&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=0195d06183c435e635144bb67683500989a84f04" alt="Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years" data-uuid="b10f6bab-c2af-3b05-882e-43bec1fbb0c5" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div>
</figure>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the Hang-Out, which is more like a small camper van/SUV designed to &#8220;provide a new way of spending time on the move.&#8221; It has a completely flat floor and movable, theater-like seats, offering &#8220;the comfort of your living room in a mobile space&#8221; — something we&#8217;ve seen with other recent EV concepts. It also offers e-4orce and advanced ProPilot features.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-11%2Fa1e62d00-50fc-11ec-bbff-1e848ca3aa8a&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=b9f156a6599ea47560c8e6d44a16cb66030c17cd" alt="Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years" data-uuid="6e701883-0a06-3b71-b0c5-33079d9488b0" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div>
</figure>
<p>Finally, the Max-Out is a concept convertible sports car that offers &#8220;superlative stability and comfort.&#8221; Body roll is limited to deliver &#8220;dynamic cornering and steering response&#8221; to optimize handling and occupant comfort. It&#8217;s supposedly lightweight with a very low center of gravity, and also offers advanced e-4orce.</p>
<p>Nissan&#8217;s new plan comes as the company has grappled with internal problems, including the arrest and subsequent flight of former CEO Carlos Ghosn. In the short term, the company plans to cut 300 billion yen ($2.65 billion) in fixed costs and reduce production capacity by 20 percent as part of its &#8220;<a href="https://www.thestar.com/autos/2021/01/13/looking-to-the-future-with-nissan-next.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">Nissan Next</a>&#8221; plan unveiled last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://talentgarden.org/en/">Talent Garden</a> is a sort of ‘European-WeWork-meets-General-Assembly’ in that its business model is a combination of co-working spaces (in places like Italy, Austria, Romania, among others) plus online/offline digital courses. It’s also a post Series B company (its last round was $73.5 million), having raised from investors such as 500 Startups and Social Capital. It’s now upping its game further with the acquisition of a majority (54%) stake in <a href="https://www.hyperisland.com/">Hyper Island</a> a place some Europeans regard as the continent’s ‘Digital Harvard University’.</p>
<p>Hyper Island emerged in the 90s as a school of excellence in the emerging world of UX and games design and has gone on to produce an enormous range of talent, which is routinely hoovered-up by the biggest tech players.</p>
<p>The combination of the two will no doubt expand both’ ability to scale their online courses (and offline, where applicable).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239969" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For instance, Talent Garden offers a myriad of business training courses for the digital world, processing around 20,000 students a year. Likewise, Hyper Island has traditionally been best known for its online education, but with Talent Garden, that inline component will no-doubt be expanded. Talent Garden also has 20 campuses across Europe.</p>
<p>Talent Garden Co-founder Rasa Strumskyte told me: “Over 60% of our courses are online and the rest on campus and we will work to expand existing courses to more markets and create new ones, especially online.”</p>
<p>It’s estimated that some 97 million new digital jobs will emerge in the next few years, with the global digital education market estimated to grow from $8.4 billion in 2020 to $33.2 billion by 2025, making it one of the fastest-growing sectors of the post-pandemic era.</p>
<p>Hyper Island has a global presence operating in Europe, Asia-Pacific, North and South America through physical establishments in the UK, Singapore, USA and Brazil.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The combined entity says it will have expected revenues of €50 million in 2022, 20,000 professionals trained a year, 5,000 students placed on the job market “with a 98% placement rate and more than 4,500 start-ups and digital innovators as teachers and community members.”</p>
<p>Davide Dattoli, Talent Garden’s Co-Founder and Executive President said: “Through joining forces with Hyper Island, our project is making a new leap forward. In such an important but fragmented market, we are readier as ever before to act as aggregators and game-changers. We will expand our training offering for the benefit of many current and future workers who are living through this time of digital transition.”</p>
<p>Irene Boni, new CEO of Talent Garden said: “Talent Garden has an opportunity to grow considerably in the in the digital education market in Europe, also by training individuals as well as large companies that want to take advantage of the benefits of digitization — which is certainly a technological issue, but most of all a question of human capital.”</p>
<p>Before joining Talent Garden, Boni had been working for the past ten years in the unicorn Yoox Net a Porter (today part of Richemont luxury group)  as CoGeneral Manager. Before that she worked at McKinsey.</p>
<p>Fredrik Mansson, Chairman of Hyper Island said: “Through the alliance with Talent Garden we will jointly get a substantial increase in the resources to accelerate both companies growth and impact in the world.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As COVID-19 spread rapidly across the world in 2020, people everywhere were hungry for reliable information. A global network of volunteers rose to the challenge, consolidating information from scientists, journalists and medical professionals, and making it accessible for everyday people.</p>
<p>Two of them live almost 3,200 kilometers away from one another: Dr.<a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/2021/08/16/arab-medical-professional-alaa-najjar-honoured-by-wikipedia-for-covid-19-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Alaa Najjar</a> is a Wikipedia volunteer and medical doctor who spends breaks during his emergency room shift addressing COVID-19 misinformation on the Arabic version of the site. Sweden-based Dr.<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/indian-doctor-in-sweden-is-a-prominent-frontline-warrior-against-covid-fake-news/articleshow/85626467.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Netha Hussain</a>, a clinical neuroscientist and doctor, spent her downtime editing COVID-19 articles in English and Malayalam (a language of southwestern India), later focusing her efforts on improving Wikipedia articles about COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>Thanks to Najjar, Hussain and more than 280,000 volunteers, Wikipedia emerged as one of the most trusted sources for up-to-date,<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/22-10-2020-the-world-health-organization-and-wikimedia-foundation-expand-access-to-trusted-information-about-covid-19-on-wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> comprehensive knowledge about COVID-19</a>, spanning nearly 7,000 articles in 188 languages. Wikipedia’s reach and ability to support knowledge-sharing on a global scale &#8212; from informing the public about a major disease to helping students study for tests &#8212; is only made possible by laws that enable its collaborative, volunteer-led model to thrive.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239261" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the European Parliament considers new regulations aimed at holding Big Tech platforms accountable for illegal content amplified on their websites and apps through packages like the Digital Services Act (DSA), it must protect citizens’ ability to collaborate in service of the public interest.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are right to try to stem the spread of content that causes physical or psychological harm, including content that is illegal in many jurisdictions. As they consider a range of provisions for the comprehensive DSA, we welcome some of the proposed elements, including requirements for greater transparency about how platforms’ content moderation works.</p>
<p>But the current draft also includes prescriptive requirements for how terms of service should be enforced. At first glance, these measures may seem necessary to curb the rising power of social media, prevent the spread of illegal content and ensure the safety of online spaces. But what happens to projects like Wikipedia? Some of the proposed requirements could shift power further away from people to platform providers, stifling digital platforms that operate differently from the large commercial platforms.</p>
<p>Big Tech platforms work in fundamentally different ways than nonprofit, collaborative websites like Wikipedia. All of the articles created by Wikipedia volunteers are available for free, without ads and without tracking our readers’ browsing habits. The commercial platforms’ incentive structures maximize profits and time on site, using algorithms that leverage detailed user profiles to target people with content that is most likely to influence them. They deploy more algorithms to moderate content automatically, which results in errors of over- and under-enforcement. For example, computer programs often confuse <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/20/1047623196/vienna-museums-artwork-onlyfans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artwork</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/germany-facebook-afd/560435/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">satire</a> with illegal content, while failing to understand human nuance and context necessary to enforce platforms’ actual rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikimedia Foundation</a> and affiliates based in specific countries, like<a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Wikimedia Deutschland</a>, support Wikipedia volunteers and their autonomy in making decisions about what information should exist on Wikipedia and what shouldn’t. The online encyclopedia’s open editing model is grounded in the belief that <em>people</em> should decide what information stays on Wikipedia, leveraging established volunteer-developed rules for neutrality and reliable sources.</p>
<p>This model ensures that for any given Wikipedia article on any subject, people who know and care about a topic enforce the rules about what content is allowed on its page. What’s more, our content moderation is transparent and accountable: All conversations between editors on the platform are publicly accessible. It is not a perfect system, but it has <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wired+wikipedia+the+last+best+place+on+the+inetnert&amp;oq=wired+wikipedia+the+last+best+place+on+the+inetnert&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l3.6572j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely worked</a> to make Wikipedia a global source of neutral and verified information.</p>
<p>Forcing Wikipedia to operate more like a commercial platform with a top-down power structure, lacking accountability to our readers and editors, would arguably subvert the DSA’s actual public interest intentions by leaving our communities out of important decisions about content.</p>
<p>The internet is at an inflection point. Democracy and civic space are under attack in Europe and around the world. Now, more than ever, all of us need to think carefully about how new rules will foster, not hinder, an online environment that allows for new forms of culture, science, participation and knowledge.</p>
<p>Lawmakers can engage with public interest communities such as ours to develop standards and principles that are more inclusive, more enforceable and more effective. But they should not impose rules that are aimed solely at the most powerful commercial internet platforms.</p>
<p>We all deserve a better, safer internet. We call on lawmakers to work with collaborators across sectors, including Wikimedia, to design regulations that empower citizens to improve it, together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.fjdynamics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FJDynamics</a>, founded by DJI&#8217;s former chief scientist Wu Di, just closed a Series B round of $70 million as it advances its goal to empower workers in the harshest environment with robotic technologies.</p>
<p>When I asked Wu what&#8217;s special about his company&#8217;s farming robots, he gave an answer that would make any publicist sweat: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think our technology is that special.&#8221; The startup&#8217;s vision, he said, is to make useful and affordable robots for the most labor-intensive industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have the most advanced AI algorithms,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;But if the technology doesn&#8217;t work on the production line or the farm, because you don&#8217;t have any industry experience, then how does your technology benefit people?&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239757" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The technologies that Wu worked on before FJDynamics were cutting-edge in every sense. At DJI, he served as the chief scientist and oversaw the drone giant&#8217;s acquisition of the Swedish format camera maker Victor Hasselblad AB in 2017. Before returning to China, he spent a decade in Sweden, during which he earned a PhD in domain-specific processor design. He also worked as a vice president at fabless semiconductor company Coresonic AB and a director at the Swedish luxury sports car maker Koenigsegg AB.</p>
<p>&#8220;After seeing all these first-class technologies, it&#8217;s a stretch to say we [FJDynamics] are a high-tech company,&#8221; said the founder, who donned a slightly faded checkered shirt and a pair of thin-rimmed glasses on the morning of our interview.</p>
<p>We were sitting in a makeshift meeting room, a partition comprising a few desks separated from the rest of the open-plan office by movable walls. The company, located in Shenzhen&#8217;s bustling tech hub Shenzhen, was fast expanding and approaching 1,000 employees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239878" style="width: 415px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239878" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2239878 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="592" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg 2753w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=103,150 103w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=205,300 205w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,1123 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=465,680 465w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1051,1536 1051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1401,2048 1401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2391637833861_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=34,50 34w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239878" class="wp-caption-text">Wu Di, founder and CEO of FJDynamics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In 2019, Wu left DJI to start FJDynamics. The company set out with a focus on agricultural robots, building tools like unmanned lawnmowers, orchard sprayers and feed pushing machines. It has since ventured into other fields that depend heavily on manual work, such as construction and manufacturing.</p>
<p>As Beijing invokes a digital upgrade in the country&#8217;s traditional industries, Chinese companies like FJDynamics are in hot demand by investors. FJDynamics itself has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/tencent-invests-in-dji-backed-agritech-startup-fj-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> attracted a rank of heavyweight financiers</a>, including Tencent and state-owned automaker Dongfeng Asset Management. DJI had a stake in the company early on but has since sold off its shares.</p>
<p>It declined to name its sole investor in its latest Series B round and only said it is a major internet firm in China. The funding, the company said, will allow it to &#8220;grow its suite of robotics automation technology across agriculture, facility management, construction and gardening, along with supporting the increasing demand of the company’s ESG product offerings in over 60 countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the years, a raft of tech talent has left DJI to set up their own shops or join others&#8217; fledgling projects. Portable battery maker EcoFlow, hairdryer Zuvi, electric toothbrush brand Evowera are among the most high-profile ones. For Wu, what drove him away from a prestigious position at the world&#8217;s largest drone company was a sense of disconnection he felt making &#8220;luxury&#8221; hardware.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at how robotic technology is being applied, there are a lot of companies using drones and autonomous vehicles. But the majority of people on earth aren&#8217;t benefiting from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agriculture, construction, gardening&#8230; Work conditions in these sectors are physically demanding and there are still a lot of us doing this kind of job. The question is how we use robotic technology to improve their work environment, and that doesn&#8217;t mean simply replacing them with robots,&#8221; said the founder.</p>

<p>One of FJDynamics&#8217; popular products is the automated feed pusher. To produce high-quality milk, cows need to be fed about ten times throughout the day. The routine requires farms to have staff on-site 24 hours. A farm with 500 cows, for example, needs about three grass feeders to take shifts. But in poorer countries, farms can&#8217;t afford to have as many workers and staff could be out tending to the cows all day even in the coldest season.</p>
<p>FJDynamics aims to make farmers&#8217; work easier. Its vision-guided feeder, which costs about 20,000 euros each, can feed up to 500 cows a day. In 2019, it acquired the 110-year-old Swedish <a href="https://www.vinge.se/en/mandates/vinge-advises-fj-dynamics-on-its-acquisition-of-sveaverken-svea-agri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">farming company Sveaverken</a>, which has helped put the Chinese firm&#8217;s feed pushing robots to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never talk about technology to my customers. The farmer is more interested in whether my product can help improve the crop yield,&#8221; said Wu. &#8220;Every farmer is an economist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of the company&#8217;s vision in &#8220;making tech affordable&#8221;, margins are &#8220;modest&#8221; and the management is vigilant about operational costs.</p>
<p>At the moment, about 40% of the startup&#8217;s sales happen outside China across some 60 countries. Many Chinese companies expanding overseas are increasingly cagey about their origin, fearing hostility against anything labeled &#8220;Chinese&#8221;. Wu takes a more proactive approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though I&#8217;ve lived in Europe for ten years, I can&#8217;t rip off my skin. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s important &#8212; whether it&#8217;s a Chinese, American or Swedish entrepreneur&#8230; As long as I build great products and bring benefits to my customers, there will be users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data compliance is especially key to a company&#8217;s global expansion. FJDynamics provides the hardware and software while its local partners help deploy the &#8220;system&#8221; using the data. Microsoft Azure is its main cloud partner outside China to allow &#8220;elastic deployment while meeting data privacy requirements such as GDPR.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our culture is that we don&#8217;t want the data,&#8221; Wu said.</p>
<p>Unlike smartphones or drones that require sophisticated processors, FJDynamics&#8217; products use relatively simple chips that could be found in China, so the firm is likely immune from the recent supply chain disruptions, the founder reckoned.</p>
<p>While Wu may not be working on the most advanced technology anymore, he looks for ways to impart his knowledge. When he&#8217;s not developing the next farming robot, he lectures at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I live a simple life that focuses on two things &#8212; product [FJDynamics] and education,&#8221; the founder said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a lot and realized that money can&#8217;t change you or make you happier. So you need a simple goal, and achieving the simple goal makes your life happier.&#8221;</p>
