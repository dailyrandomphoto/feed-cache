It&#8217;s not yet clear how many there are or if they&#8217;re accessible to drivers, but the deployment at least includes Florida.</p>
<p>Tesla hasn&#8217;t commented on the rollout and is believe to have disbanded its PR team.</p>
<p>There are multiple possible uses for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starlink-rectangular-terminal-satellite-internet-112330512.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">Starlink broadband</a> at Superchargers. At the least, it could replace or supplement the existing connections that handle basics like payments and charger status. That could help the company deploy Superchargers faster and in more remote areas. That&#8217;s important when the brand hopes to allow <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-the-netherlands-supercharger-pilot-223842483.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">charging for non-Tesla EVs</a> and triple the size of its station network.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233969" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You don&#8217;t need that much bandwidth (the <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/starlink-hughesnet-viasat-performance-q2-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1">median</a> US Starlink connection is about 97Mbps) just to process transactions, though, and it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if Tesla used the satellite link to provide WiFi to Supercharger customers. You&#8217;re typically parked at a charger for long enough to watch some TV episodes — you could stream shows without a Premium Connectivity subscription or using your phone as a hotspot. Network congestion could be a problem if the chargers are busy, but it would be convenient and potentially sell customers on Starlink service at home.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Since its seed round, Aplazo grew its total processing volume more than eight times and in less than a year has partnered with over 1,000 merchants.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four months after securing a $5.25 million seed round, Mexican buy now, pay later startup <a href="https://aplazo.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aplazo</a> is back with an even bigger round to expand adoption of the payment plan approach across that country.</p>
<p>Angel Peña and Alex Wieland co-founded the company in 2020. Prior to Aplazo, Peña lived in New York and worked at Morgan Stanley investing in credit in Mexico, while Wieland had been launching businesses across Latin America after spending time at companies like Uber and Lime.</p>
<p>Aplazo plugs into a merchant’s payment process, online or offline, and enables users to purchase items and pay in five equal installments without needing a credit card.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233575" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That offline component, in particular, is what Peña says differentiates the company from competitors, as 95% of purchases are still made offline in Mexico. Typically, you need to have a credit card in order to take advantage of installments. However, credit penetration in Mexico is low, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/865822/credit-card-ownership-rate-age-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 10%</a>, due to lack of trust in the banking system, he added. The more popular payment methods are still cash or a <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/merchant-services/insights/reports/mexico" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debit card</a>.</p>
<p>“That means 90% of people are unaddressed,” Peña told TechCrunch. “There is huge adoption for it, but the roadblocks are the banks who have been super profitable, but have not democratized installment credit.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qeJAjklt0t"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/balancing-risk-modern-architectures-role-in-the-bnpl-playbook/">Balancing risk: Modern architecture&#8217;s role in the BNPL playbook</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Balancing risk: Modern architecture&#8217;s role in the BNPL playbook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/balancing-risk-modern-architectures-role-in-the-bnpl-playbook/embed/#?secret=qeJAjklt0t" data-secret="qeJAjklt0t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The merchant is charged a fee to use the tool, but customers are not, and Alplazo takes on the risk of installment payments and chargebacks. The merchant then benefits from increased conversion rates and higher average order values, while also maintaining a consumer relationship.</p>
<p>Due to about 40% of the population not having a credit history, Aplazo uses alternative data, such as open banking and telecom data, to gauge consumers’ creditworthiness and level of affordability, optimizing approval rates and providing fair credit products to underserved consumers, Peña said.</p>
<p>Today, they announced $27 million in Series A investment led by Oak HC/FT, with participation from existing investors Kaszek and Picus Capital. This gives the company total funds of over $35 million.</p>
<p>Peña says the new funding was unexpected since the company had enough capital from its seed round. However, the opportunity provided the company a chance to accelerate its mission, which includes technology and product development and investing in merchant success. In addition, the company intends to double its 50-person team by February and launch in two additional countries in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since the seed round, Aplazo grew its total processing volume more than eight times and in less than a year has partnered with over 1,000 merchants that operate in lifestyle products like fashion, footwear and beauty. Peña estimates these categories represent some $70 billion in spending in both online and offline purchases.</p>
<p>Aplazo is the latest startup going after the BNPL space that has been dominated by companies like Afterpay, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/extra-crunch-roundup-square-buys-afterpay-paid-search-basics-career-advice-for-devs/">bought by Square</a> earlier this summer, Klarna and Affirm. There has been a lot of activity in the past year, between M&amp;A with Afterpay and companies like ShopBack, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/singapore-based-cashback-platform-shopback-acquires-bnpl-service-hoolah/">agreed to acquire Hoolah</a>, and funding rounds for BNPL companies. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/billie-a-buy-now-pay-later-specialist-for-the-b2b-market-raises-100m-on-a-640m-valuation/">Billie</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/nelo-joins-the-bnpl-rush-with-20m-in-new-funding-and-the-mexican-market-in-its-sights/">Nelo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/scalapay-raises-155m-at-a-700m-valuation-as-buy-now-pay-later-services-continue-to-boom/">Scalapay</a> raised recently.</p>
<p>“We have been fascinated by the global phenomenon that is buy now, pay later,” Allen Miller, principal at Oak HC/FT, said. “We wanted to make an investment in Latin America and thought that buy now, pay later would be an interesting entry point. The industry has the same appetite as the U.S., but is on steroids, and with the limited access to credit opportunity for buy now, pay later to be successful, Angel and Alex fit the mold.”</p>
<p>Miller expects the future of buy now, pay later in Latin America to be a bright one for a couple of reasons: one, fewer millennials are getting credit cards and are instead relying on debit cards. Two, merchants want to access a whole swath of people, but can’t due to the large amount of people who don’t have access to credit. Aplazo is building an infrastructure around both of those elements and “has been able to attract talent from best brands, and when we saw that momentum, that was exciting,” he added.</p>

<p>Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before we jump, I wanted to note that the <strong>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</strong> posted what appears to be the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/TESLA/MODEL%252520Y%252520%2525205-SEAT/SUV/RWD">first crash involving a Tesla</a> that had the FSD beta software engaged. As always, Tesla vehicles equipped with full self-driving (FSD) software are not self driving. What does this mean? Well, my expectation is that there will be more incidents like this and as a result NHTSA will be forced to act.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Oh and I&#8217;ll be out in Los Angeles this coming week for a number of events, including CoMotion and the Los Angeles Auto Show. Stay tuned for our coverage throughout the week.</p>
<p>Ok, let&#8217;s go!</p>

<p><strong>Wheels</strong>, the shared micromobility operator with distinctive sit-down scooters, has partnered with <strong>UMass Boston</strong>, and soon, with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.</p>
<p><strong>Free Now</strong>, the mobility app backed by BMW and Daimler, has officially integrated with <strong>Dott</strong>, allowing customers to <a href="https://www.realwire.com/releases/FREE-NOW-integrates-Dott-micro-mobility-services-into-its-app">book Dott&#8217;s e-scooters on the app</a>, and eventually, its e-bikes, too. The partnership will be available in the U.K., France, Italy, Poland and Germany, with more countries expected to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Bird</strong> riders surveyed in Atlanta show that nearly half of all riders <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/nearly-half-bird-riders-atlanta-are-women-bike-lanes-have-helped/">identify as female</a>, which is a promising stat if we&#8217;re trying to close the gender gap in the micromobility world. In the same survey, 65% of respondents said protected bike lanes would encourage them to use more scooters.</p>
<p>In other Bird news, the company is launching its <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/mogo-bikeshare-integrates-with-bird-detroit/">public bikeshare integration</a> with MoGo in Detroit, a docked bikeshare service. Bird will now feature MoGo bikes in its app.</p>
<p><strong>Tier</strong> is <a href="https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/tier-mobility-europes-largest-micro-mobility-operator-gets-all-charged-up-with-the-arrival-of-10-new-all-electric-man-etge-vans/">bringing 500 e-bikes</a> to the London Borough of Islington, boosting green transport options following the Ultra Low Emissions Zone expansion. The company has also just added 10 new all-electric MAN eTGE vans in London. The vans will be used to service Tier&#8217;s e-scooter fleet.</p>
<p><strong>Cabify</strong> has added a new business line to its multimodal repertoire. The <a href="https://twitter.com/cabify_espana/status/1458462709930987530?s=20">company is partnering</a> with <strong>Velca</strong>, a Spanish e-motorcycle brand, to provide users in Barcelona, Malaga, Madrid, Sevilla and Valencia with monthly rentals of electric motorcycles.</p>
<p>Back in July, <strong>BMW</strong> announced it would finally start producing its retro-futuristic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/bmw-is-finally-producing-its-retro-futuristic-ce-04-electric-scooter-but-at-12k-will-anyone-buy-it/">CE 04 electric motorbike</a>, a vehicle it has released multiple concepts around. Now, the automaker has entered into <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/09/bmw-begins-full-production-of-its-75-mph-ce-04-futuristic-electric-motorbike/">full series production</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Propella</strong>, the e-bike manufacturer, introduced its <a href="https://www.propella.bike/shop/ebikes/mini">Propella Mini bike</a>, its smallest and lightest model yet. Coming in at just 33 pounds and 59 inches long, the Mini has 20-inch wheels, a small frame and low-power electronics. It&#8217;s equipped with a 400W Bafang motor, which is good for mainly flat land riding. It can handle a slope of about 10% grade.</p>
<p>Anyone buying an e-bike or e-scooter, should be taking precautions, say fire departments and safety officials, after an increase in battery fires linked to micromobility devices. The <strong>New York Fire Department</strong> reported <a href="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/cities-report-ebike-fires-micromobility-safety/609516/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202021-11-10%20Smart%20Cities%20Dive%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:37926%5D&amp;utm_term=Smart%20Cities%20Dive">78 fires linked to e-bikes</a> this year and their lithium-ion batteries that can get overheated and catch fire if they&#8217;re not charged or disposed of properly.</p>

<p>We all knew it was going to be big. Rivian&#8217;s IPO has been highly anticipated. Still, the reaction and willingness of investors to buy shares 37% higher than the listed price is simply bananas. Rivian shares were listed at $78 and its opening trade was $106.75.</p>
<p>The  company has a trickle of revenue and mounting losses due to the expense of ramping up production of its R1T and R1S vehicles and RCV, the electric commercial vans it is supplying to Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/rivian-expands-into-fleet-business-beyond-amazon-deal/">and maybe others</a>. That didn&#8217;t stop people from piling in and helping push Rivian&#8217;s value past $110 billion. (Closing share price on Friday was $129.95). Rivian now has a market cap beyond GM and Ford, two legacy automakers that actually produce and sell millions of vehicles each year.</p>
<p>Those niggling details like revenue didn&#8217;t dampen the mood. Even Amazon, which already held a 20% stake in the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/amazon-adds-to-its-rivian-stake/">bought even more shares</a>, per a Friday afternoon regulatory filing. Amazon now owns a total of 158,363,834 shares of Rivian, or about 22%.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been speculation about whether Ford, which owns about 12% of Rivian, will cash out. The automaker has made a hefty return on it investment already. Ford has made about $820 million in equity and bond investments in Rivian. Those shares, about 102 million according to filings, are now worth $13.15 billion.</p>
<p>What comes next? You better believe the attention on Rivian will be intense as it tries to meet production and delivery targets on the commercial delivery van for Amazon and its consumer products.</p>
<p>Rivian is supposed to deliver the first 10 vans (out of an order of 100,000) to Amazon in December. When there is a customer like Amazon to please, that deadline might be difficult to keep. I&#8217;ll be watching.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ample</strong>, a startup developing battery swapping technology for electric vehicles, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/ample-is-the-ev-battery-industrys-newest-unicorn/">raised $30 million</a> from The Blackstone Group and Spanish multinational financial services company Banco Santander.</p>

<p><strong>DoorDash</strong>, the on-demand delivery giant acquired food delivery company <strong>Wolt</strong> in an all-stock deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/doordash-to-acquire-food-delivery-company-wolt/">valued at €7 billion</a>, or $8.1 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Embark Trucks</strong>, an autonomous vehicle company completed its SPAC merger and began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker EMBK. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/11/embark-ceo-sees-supply-chain-crisis-as-the-inflection-point-for-autonomous-trucking.html">CNBC profiled</a> its 26-year-old founder and CEO Alex Rodrigues.</p>
<p><strong>Gett</strong>, the ride-hailing company, reached a deal to merge with a special-purpose acquisition company with Rosecliff Acquisition Corp. I, a SPAC backed by the investment firm Rosecliff Venture Management LLC, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gett-nears-1-1-billion-spac-merger-to-go-public-11636498833">the WSJ reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>GoTo Group</strong>, the Indonesia-based startup borne out of a merger in May between ride-hailing giant Gojek and e-commerce company Tokopedia, secured more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/indonesian-goto-group-raises-over-1-3b-in-its-first-close-of-pre-ipo/">$1.3 billion</a> in the first close of its pre-IPO funding. The round was led by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, with participation from Avanda Investment Management, Fidelity International, Google, Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), Primavera Capital, SeaTown Master Fund, Temasek, Tencent and Ward Ferry.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>, a startup that finances commercial electric vehicle operations and has plans to build, own and operate the corresponding charging infrastructure, came out of stealth with an initial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/ev-fleet-and-charging-infrastructure-startup-inspiration-comes-out-of-stealth-with-200m-and-revel-as-first-customer/">$200 million in investment</a>. The funding comes from ArcLight Capital Partners, a venture fund that invests in energy infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, one of the last privately held autonomous truck outfits in Silicon Valley, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-robotics-raises-125m/">raised $125 million</a> in new capital. Notably, the lead investor is not listed and not being disclosed.

<p>Other investors include newcomers SIP Global Partners, Muirwoods Ventures, Harpoon Ventures, StepStone Group, Gopher Asset Management, Walleye Capital, Aliya Capital Partners and others. Existing investors Battery Ventures, CRV and Lightspeed Venture Partners also participated. Bridgestone Americas and BMW i Ventures, which had announced strategic investments in Kodiak earlier this year, converted its funds to this round.</p>

The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211108006149/en/Hennessy-Capital-Investment-Corp.-V-and-Plus-Mutually-Agree-to-Terminate-Business-Combination-Agreement">companies said</a> this was &#8220;in light of recent developments in the regulatory environment outside of the United States.&#8221; Plus, an autonomous vehicle company, said it is pursuing a potential restructuring of certain aspects of its business. Importantly, Plus&#8217; deal to supply Amazon with driver-assistant technology remains intact, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/plus-spac-merger-canceled-amazon-deal-rolls-along">Automotive News reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Point One Navigation</strong>, a startup that combines augmented Global Navigation Satellite System, computer vision and sensor fusion into an API to provide precise location for robotics, OEMs and AV developers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/point-one-navigation-raises-10m-to-bring-its-precise-location-tech-to-all-vehicles/">raised $10 million</a>. The Series A round was led by UP.Partners, with participation from existing investors including BOLT, IA Ventures and Ludlow Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>RabbitMart</strong>, or Rabbit for short, came out of stealth with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/rabbit-a-20-minute-convenience-delivery-startup-in-egypt-comes-out-of-stealth-with-11m-pre-seed/">$11 million in pre-seed funding</a> amid a booming fast-delivery market in Africa.

<h2>A little bird</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896211 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif" alt="blinky cat bird green" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I hear things, but I&#8217;m not selfish. Let me share. Three quick items this week that are all about executive shuffling in the autonomous vehicle industry.</p>
<p>You might remember that <strong>Anthony Foxx</strong>, the Secretary of Transportation under President Barack Obama, joined <strong>Lyft</strong> as chief policy officer and senior adviser back in 2018.</p>
<p>Foxx is stepping down from the CPO gig, I learned recently. The new CPO will be Jeremy Bird, who is taking over in January. Bird joined Lyft in 2019 and was promoted to deputy CPO nearly a year ago.</p>
<p>Lyft did confirm this tidbit to me and said Foxx will stay on as a senior adviser. Here&#8217;s a statement from Foxx that was sent me.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the right time for me. I worked hard to build the absolute best policy team in business. There&#8217;s really no other team like us. That&#8217;s really what I came to do, and I could not be more proud of our people or have more confidence in Lyft going forward. I can now feel good about transitioning the team while continuing to advise Lyft. Jeremy has been an instrumental part of this team and is a great leader in his own right. I&#8217;m thrilled to pass the torch to him.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another departure that actually occurred months ago, but no one has reported on, is over at <strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2018, Kodiak came out of stealth with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-robotics-raises-40-million/">$40 million in funding</a> and an intriguing founder lineup. One co-founder was Don Burnette, who is CEO and a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry. Burnette, left the Google self-driving project engineer to co-found self-driving truck startup Otto in early 2016, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/anthony-levandowski-is-back-with-a-new-self-driving-startup-called-kache-ai/">Anthony Levandowski</a>, Lior Ron and Claire Delaunay. He left in March 2018, about a year after Uber bought Otto.</p>
<p>The other co-founder was <strong>Paz Eshel</strong>, former venture capitalist. Specifically, he had been a vice president at Battery Ventures, where he led the firm’s autonomous-vehicle investment project. Battery Ventures led Kodiak&#8217;s first round and Itzik Parnafes, a general partner at Battery Ventures, joined the Kodiak board.</p>
<p>I learned, and Burnette confirmed, that Eshel is no longer at the company. Burnette wouldn&#8217;t provide further details except to say that he departed earlier this summer. I reached out, but have not heard from Eshel.</p>
<p>And finally, it seems that <strong>Gretchen Effgen</strong>, a long time executive at <strong>Motional</strong>, is now at Google.</p>
<p>Effgen led partnerships and marketing at nuTonomy, the autonomous vehicle startup that was acquired by Aptiv in November 2018. This venture was spun out in 2020 as Motional, a $4 billion joint venture with Hyundai. Effgen joined Google as it director of global automotive partnerships, platforms and ecosystems this month, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p>
<h2>Policy corner</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2037863 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png" alt="the-station-delivery" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>I want to touch briefly on the news regarding the <strong>$1.2 trillion infrastructure bill</strong> passed by Congress last Friday &#8212; briefly because, well, there&#8217;s tons already out there detailing in full what it includes and doesn&#8217;t include, what it means for roads, ports and the railway system.</p>
<p>Regarding transportation electrification, the big wins include:<br />
• $5 billion for zero-emission transit<br />
• $5 billion to expand EV chargers along highways, plus an additional $2.5 billion that could go toward EV charging or other types of alternative fuel, like hydrogen stations<br />
• $2.5 billion to electrify school buses</p>
<p>There are a few other interesting tidbits included in the bill that caught my eye as well, especially an &#8220;Advanced Impaired Driving Technology&#8221; provision. Essentially, this provision gives the <strong>National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration</strong> three years to evaluate anti-drunk driving auto tech and issue a new safety standard, which automakers will be required to incorporate into new vehicles two years after that.</p>
<p>NHTSA will no doubt be evaluating driver monitoring tech, including sensors outside the vehicle and even in-vehicle sensors that actually monitor the driver&#8217;s eyes and attention. It looks like many technologies that are already rolling out in vehicles today, like lane departure warnings, could be used for this purpose, and other companies are already starting to look into how their systems could be used to prevent drunk driving.</p>
<p>Also of note: NHTSA will receive around $110 million per year to conduct &#8220;behavioral research on Automated Systems and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and improving consumer responses to safety recalls.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>Another bill was passed this week that could mean big things for everything from drones to eVTOL. That is the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1339">Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act</a>, which will establish an interagency working group within the Department of Transportation to &#8220;plan and coordinate efforts related to the safety, operations, infrastructure, physical security, cybersecurity, and Federal investment necessary for maturation of the AAM ecosystem&#8221; in the U.S.</p>
<p>This is a big deal! This goes far beyond the Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s authority to certify aircraft, which is really one one piece of the puzzle to launching AAM technologies. This working group will make recommendations for all the other pieces in which the federal government plays a role, like safety requirements of future air traffic management systems; infrastructure, including utility infrastructure, to support the growth of AAM; and community acceptance of the tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congress spending intentional time looking at infrastructure, looking at operations, looking at how all of these things can come to fruition and really benefit states in the communities that each of these Senators and Representatives serve is pretty big,&#8221; Ian Villa, COO of Whisper Aero, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The working group&#8217;s recommendations will also likely push conformity &#8212; which is good for end users and industry, Villa added. &#8220;There&#8217;s no way we can stand up a real system if the way that air taxis operate in Miami is different than the way [they] operate in California.&#8221;</p>
<p>The working group will be required to submit a report to Congress on their findings.</p>

<h2>Notable news and other tidbits</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1926823 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Gatik</strong>, autonomous delivery startup focused on the middle mile, pulled the safety operator from behind the wheel of two self-driving box trucks that operate in Walmart&#8217;s home turf of Bentonville, Arkansas. This means the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/gatik-driverless-deliveries-walmart/">startup&#8217;s box trucks are driverless</a> on a commercial route. TechCrunch actually reported about this in August, when the company first went fully driverless. Gatik revealed more details on this milestone, including that it has a chase vehicle for now.</p>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong> and <strong>Motional</strong> will launch their first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/motional-and-lyft-to-launch-driverless-commercial-robotaxi-service-in-las-vegas-in-2023/">fully driverless ride-hail service</a> in Las Vegas in 2023. The companies aim to be transporting public passengers — via Motional&#8217;s electric Hyundai IONIQ 5-based robotaxis and booked through the Lyft app — by the second half of next year. They will eventually scale up to a full commercial launch when Lyft is allowed to charge for rides in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Nvidia</strong> said that Hyperion 8 &#8212; a production-ready platform that includes sensors, compute and software needed for AV development &#8212; is now available to buy for 2024 vehicle models. Hyperion 8 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/nvidias-next-generation-self-driving-toolkit-is-available-for-2024-vehicle-models/">is the latest iteration</a> of the end-to-end Nvidia Drive platform that automakers can use to customize to their likening and needs. This was revealed back in April. However, some details, including which companies are supplying the 12 cameras, nine radars and one lidar that are part of the platform, weren&#8217;t shared until this past week. Notably, <strong>Luminar</strong> is supplying the lidar, a potential boon for the newly public company. Continental, Hella, Sony and Valeo are also supplying sensors to Nvidia for the Hyperion 8.</p>
<p><strong>Plus</strong>, the autonomous vehicle company I cited up in the &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; section, announced a partnership with Aeva lidar. Aeva&#8217;s tech will be used in Plus&#8217;s first 100,000 trucks.</p>
<p><strong>Ouster</strong>, a lidar company, held its <a href="https://investors.ouster.com/news/news-details/2021/Ouster-Reports-Third-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx">Q3 earnings call last week</a>. Ouster said it is spending more on R&amp;D and scaling up a division focused just on automotive, another signal that lidar companies have to diversify their offerings to stay afloat.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>GreenPower</strong> and <strong>Perrone Robotics</strong> are teaming up to produce the <a href="https://greenpowermotor.com/gp-products/av-star/">AV Star</a>. It&#8217;s a combination of GreenPower&#8217;s EV star, a mini electric bus, that will be fitted with Perrone&#8217;s TONY autonomous vehicle retrofit kit.</p>
<p><strong>Workhorse Group</strong>, the troubled electric vehicle startup, is struggling — and beyond its Q3 $81 million loss. Revenue is also in the negative to the tune of $576,600 because it had to issue refunds to customers who had their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/workhorse-reports-81m-loss-plans-to-redesign-c-1000-electric-cargo-van/">C-1000 cargo delivery vans</a> recalled due to safety issues. Workhorse CEO Rick Dauch also admitted that, aside from federal safety issues, the C-1000 just might not be up to the task of heavy duty deliveries. Yikes.</p>
<h3>Misc. stuff</h3>
<p>The <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> filed a lawsuit against ride-hailing giant Uber over claims that the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/the-doj-is-suing-uber-over-claims-its-wait-time-fee-policy-discriminates-against-people-with-disabilities/">discriminates against passengers with disabilities</a>, in violation of the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lawrence Burns</strong>, an author and former corporate vp of research &amp; development and planning at General Motors, is now an executive adviser of autonomous sensing platforms company Neural Propulsion Systems. Burns was a former adviser to Waymo.</p>
<p><strong>MotoRefi</strong>, the auto refinance platform, changed its name to Caribou. Along with the new branding and logo, Caribou recently combined its auto financing product with insurance. The company said it plans to announce specific details on insurance carrier plans in early 2022.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Last year, California&#8217;s supreme court <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-apple-pay-employees-bag-searches-lost-time.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">ruled</a> that Apple broke the law by failing to pay employees while they waited for mandatory bag and iPhone searches. Now, Apple has offered to pay $30 million to settle the suit and lawyers for the employees have urged them to accept it, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/11/13/apple-to-pay-30m-to-retail-employees-for-off-the-clock-bag-device-searches" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>Apple Insider</em></a> has reported. &#8220;This is a significant, non-reversionary settlement reached after nearly eight years of hard-fought litigation,&#8221; wrote plaintiff attorney Lee Shalov in the proposed settlement seen by <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/apple-to-pay-30-million-to-employees-subjected-to-off-the-clock-searches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Courthouse News</em></a>.</p>
<p>Employees launched the suit way back in 2013, saying they weren&#8217;t paid while being searched for stolen merchandise or trade secrets. The workers felt they were still under Apple&#8217;s &#8220;control&#8221; during that five to 20 minute process and should therefore be compensated. Apple in turn argued that the employees could choose not to bring their bags or iPhones, thus avoiding a search in the first place.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Apple </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/FrlekinetalvAppleInc?1581671141" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">won</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an earlier battle in district court, but the case went to the California Supreme Court on appeal. There, the judges ruled that Apple workers were &#8220;clearly under Apple&#8217;s control while awaiting, and during, the exit searches.&#8221; The court dismissed Apple&#8217;s argument that bringing a bag to work was an employee convenience, particularly that Apple felt employees didn&#8217;t necessarily need to bring their iPhones to work.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Its characterization of the iPhone as unnecessary for its own employees is directly at odds with its description of the iPhone as an &#8216;integrated and integral&#8217; part of the lives of everyone else,&#8221; the judges wrote. In that statement, the court referenced a 2017 Tim Cook interview where he stated that the iPhone was &#8220;so so integrated and integral to our lives, you wouldn&#8217;t think about leaving home without it.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233961" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The settlement is still subject to approval by the plaintiffs. Nearly 12,000 current and former Apple Store employees in California involved in the lawsuit stand to receive a maximum payment of around $1,200.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For any company, organization, or even individual writer, maintaining a consistent voice is a constant challenge. <a href="https://writer.com">Writer</a> is a startup aiming to provide a solution with an intelligent integrated style guide that goes beyond mere error checking. Following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/writer-pens-a-5m-seed-round-for-its-ai-style-guide-that-flags-bias-and-tone/">$5M seed</a> last year, the company has now raised a $20M A round to continue growing and improving its service.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO May Habib says that writing is &#8220;the last unstructured business process,&#8221; which is perhaps a bit optimistic (sometimes I think every business process is unstructured) but nevertheless a cogent thesis on which to build a company. Writing is, after all, fundamentally a creative process, and it is only by systematically taming that process that writing is able to be used as a business tool. (Even now I am taming it: must&#8230; resist&#8230; using em dashes in every sentence&#8230;)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to make sure that copy is clean and accurate, quite another to make sure that a dozen writers do not have clashing styles, use inaccurate or inappropriate phrases, and generally stick to a tone and style chosen by leadership. Of course there are style guides — even TechCrunch has one — but anyone who writes for a living knows how difficult it can be to stop and consult one when they&#8217;re in the zone.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232934" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Writer is meant to be a sort of style guide angel that sits on your shoulder and keeps your writing in line while you&#8217;re writing. It plugs into Chrome and Word, among other platforms, and instantly catches you out on everything from typos to company tone. Basically, Habib explained, you &#8220;take these 80, 90-page guidelines and turn it into a web app that becomes the single source of truth.&#8221; Notably this is all done without using a client company&#8217;s content as training data, so there&#8217;s no risk of HIPAA or security violations that way.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233092" style="width: 944px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/writer-list1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233092" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/writer-list1.gif" alt="A cursor selects a word from a style guide for more details." width="934" height="809" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2233092" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Writer</p></div></p>
<p>That helps not just keep copy clean, but also make sure companies are taking action on things like, for example, inclusive language. A company may not have considered it worth formalizing in its style guide how to use gender-neutral language, or how to refer to various groups in the preferred manner, but it&#8217;s built into Writer if you want it — just check a few boxes and now all your company&#8217;s copy will be written more inclusively in line with recommendations from experts. There are other basic rules users can configure around common items like hyphenation, spacing, date and location formatting, serial commas, and so on.</p>
<p>But you knew all this, because you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/writer-pens-a-5m-seed-round-for-its-ai-style-guide-that-flags-bias-and-tone/">read all about Writer back in 2020</a>. So what&#8217;s new? Well, apart from the money, the company is growing fast. They&#8217;ve nearly doubled their staff, from 14 to 25 (still small, obviously, but growing fast) and have signed up a laundry list of high-profile customers: Twitter, Intuit, Pinterest, Accenture, Deloitte, and UnitedHealthcare among 150 or so more. The growing client list contributed to a tripled ARR over the last year. DAUs and MAUs and all those lovely metrics have risen steadily as well.</p>
<p>Confidence from happy customers has led the company to begin diversifying its service, branching out from correction and guidance into automation. Now, &#8220;automated&#8217; writing sounds pretty bad, but only if you are still clinging to that creative instinct. Writing is about effective communication, and in a professional context that means consistency. So things like text snippets, already widely used in the industry, can be included in a smarter, more easily deployed way.</p>
<p>The app now also supports multiple teams within an organization, so sales and editorial, for example, don&#8217;t have clashing definitions or recommendations. There&#8217;s also Figma integration now, a commonly requested feature now that style is being included as part of broader design systems at many companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The most intriguing feature is still a little ways down the roadmap: a more sophisticated language-aware AI system that understands context and content, akin to OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3 but independently developed. How and why this was attempted will be worth investigating when more information is available.</p>
<p>But the applications are obvious: An app that&#8217;s aware of what you&#8217;re writing and the broader context can make suggestions that are based on hazier concepts like overall tone or intention. For example it might be able to tell that you&#8217;re attempting to state the company&#8217;s policy on refunds, and automatically suggest the approved standard copy for that. No need to go hunting around for the right snippet or consult the style guide. Or it could see that overall the piece uses more technical or jargon than is generally liked, and recommend reworkings of entire paragraphs in plainer language.</p>
<p>At any rate, the company is looking to continue expanding and staffing up, something $21M ought to help with. The round was led by Insight Partners, with a very long list of other participants: Gradient Ventures, the Todd &amp; Rahul Angel Fund, Scott Belsky, Oliver Jay, Jack Altman, Allison Pickens, Packy McCormick, Lenny Rachitsky, Austin Rief, Ankur Nagpal, Alex MacCaw, Camille Ricketts, Vivek Sodera, Julia Lipton, and James Beshara.</p>
<p>Keep an eye open for more news soon about Writer&#8217;s language AI ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doola, a startup that aims to help global entrepreneurs form a U.S. business, has raised $3 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.doola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doola</a> actually started its life in 2020 as StartPack as a pivot from another startup called Standups. During that pivot process, the team realized that it didn’t want to go through the “complex and time-consuming” process of setting up the full-stack of software and accounts needed to get a business off the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted to focus on building product, talking to users and growing our new business, and we thought, ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what if we could click a button and initialize a company?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said co-founder and CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arjun Mahadevan. In September, the New York-based company built an MVP and got its first paying customer. It recently rebranded from StartPack to doola.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233146" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doola’s mission is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">support its customers through the incorporation process so they can “confidently collect payments, build credibility, stay legal and make more money,” said Mahadevan, a former growth product manager at Dropbox. Specifically, doola provides company formation, an EIN (employee identification number), a U.S. address and bank account, access to U.S. payments, a free tax consultation, U.S. tax support, a phone number and $50,000 in startup “perks.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, hundreds of companies have formed LLCs with doola &#8212; even without a U.S. Social Security number. And the company is &#8220;growing profitably from a unit economics perspective,&#8221; according to Mahadevan.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233151" style="width: 2706px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233151" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2233151 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="2696" height="1434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg 2696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,817 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1089 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2696px) 100vw, 2696px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233151" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> doola</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes doola stand out in the space, according to Mahadevan, is that it doesn’t just help a founder incorporate and leave them to fend for themselves.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not just a formation service, we’re a full-service fintech company,” he told TechCrunch. “Formation is our wedge to build the operating system for creators globally: from formation to financial to legal stack, by providing technical, educational and personal support every step of the way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if there are things that doola can’t provide in-house, it works with partners such as Amazon and Twilio to help, Mahadevan said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nexus-venture-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexus Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led doola’s financing, which brings the company’s total raised to $3.6 million. The startup participated in Y Combinator’s summer 2020 batch and also counts as backers Hustle Fund, XX, Psion Capital and Translink Investment, as well as a high-profile group of angels, including </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-reses-938b7850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacqueline Reses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former head of Square Capital; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dharmesh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dharmesh Shah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founder and CTO at HubSpot; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankurnagpal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ankur Nagpal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founder at Teachable and of Vibe Capital; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohinipandhi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rohini Pandhi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, product manager at Square and partner at Transparent Collective; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asethi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arjun Sethi</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-founder and investor at Tribe Capital; and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/myprasanna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prasanna Sankar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-founder of Rippling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doola plans to use its new capital to scale its team. Besides Mahadevan and co-founder and CTO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JP Pincheira</span><b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doola has 14 employees. The capital will also go toward product and engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reses noted that the creator economy is booming, with more than 50 million people becoming creators in the last decade &#8212; and those creators becoming businesses in the coming decade. She believes doola is poised to help such global businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“doola makes it incredibly easy for anyone, from anywhere in the world to set up a US-based LLC, get a US bank account, with access to all the payment products and financial services typically reserved for US-based businesses,” she wrote via email. “What intrigues me about this business however is not this initial beachhead of business formation, but the longer-term opportunity they have to handle all the unsexy business management pieces for creators and independent entrepreneurs around the world &#8212; including incorporation, banking, taxes and other critical pieces of infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jishnu Bhattacharjee, managing director of Nexus Venture Partners, agrees. He joined doola&#8217;s board as part of the financing.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Creators and independent entrepreneurs want to focus on their crafts that they love. However, to build businesses around their crafts, they would also need to take care of unexciting but necessary backend business management functions, for which they usually do not have expertise, nor interest, nor the time those activities demand,&#8221; he wrote via email. &#8220;doola is set to address just that: so solo-preneurs can do what they love and are best at, while doola takes care of the rest.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoomo, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/zoomo-raises-12-million-expand-e-bike-subscription-offerings/">Australian startup that builds e-bikes and offers micromobility subscriptions</a> to gig workers and couriers, wants to be the next disruptive electric vehicle company. The startup has just announced a $60 million Series B fundraise, money it aims to use to transform the way companies look at last-mile delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really see ourselves disrupting Rivian,&#8221; Mina Nada, CEO and co-founder of Zoomo, told TechCrunch. Rivian is an electric vehicle startup that&#8217;s building an electric SUV and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/">electric pickup truck</a> – it went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/electric-automaker-rivian-largest-ipo-2021/">public last week at an implied valuation of $90 billion</a>. &#8220;We think that it doesn&#8217;t make sense for 90% of deliveries in the United States of two kilogram burgers to be done in 2-ton vehicles. And we really think that that&#8217;s going to change fundamentally to being Zoomo vehicles in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half of Zoomo&#8217;s $60 million funding comes from equity led by Grok Ventures, Skip Capital and ArcTern Ventures, and supported by AirTree Ventures, Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Contrarian Ventures and Maniv Mobility. The equity, Nada says, will be invested directly into the platform, including software and a servicing network.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233908" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The other half comes from asset-backed debt from Viola Group, which the startup will use to scale up its hardware into existing and new markets. The company already operates in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and has recently expanded into new cities in those markets, like Manchester, U.K. and Chicago, Illinois, as well as into Valencia in Spain, Paris in France and Stuttgart in Germany. The debt will allow Zoomo to pay a monthly subscription on its bikes rather than paying a large lump-sum upfront.</p>
<p>Many of Zoomo&#8217;s existing customers have asked the company to expand after being unable to find others to meet their needs in those markets, says Nada, so more cities are on the horizon for the startup.</p>
<p>Zoomo&#8217;s business is broken down into B2B and B2C elements. The startup offers fleets of electric bikes (and in some markets, mopeds), as well as fleet management software, to enterprise customers like Domino&#8217;s. It also deals directly with couriers, often through partnerships with gig worker platforms like DoorDash, that want a flexible, durable work vehicle at an affordable price. Zoomo offers gig workers a weekly subscription, which includes servicing, for anywhere from $20 per week to $49 per week.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are realizing we can&#8217;t hit zero emissions by continuing to just electrify vehicles, and right-sizing the form factor is a win for everybody,&#8221; said Nada. &#8220;It&#8217;s more efficient, there are faster food deliveries with less congestion. Couriers can make more money because they can do more deliveries per hour, and customers are happier because the deliveries come more quickly. We really see micromobility disrupting the traditional four-wheeled space, and we are heavily focused right now on the fact that no micromobility company is doing a really good job for the logistics space, even though there&#8217;s some cool companies doing a good job in the consumer space.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zoomo says its vehicles are built for couriers who have to ride eight hours per day, complete with big batteries that can carry a worker on late night slogs through the rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safety is a really big feature for them, so is durability,&#8221; said Nada, whose pedigree includes Deliveroo, Bolt Bikes, Bain and Mobike. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got customers doing 50,000 kilometers per annum on a bike, so the requirements for delivery are really quite different to the consumer space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/">URB-E</a> in the U.S. and <a href="http://velove.se/electric-cargo-bike">Velove</a> in Sweden are also trying to address the last-mile delivery space, but they&#8217;re more focused on container deliveries that can even accommodate middle-mile than food deliveries, which is where Zoomo specializes for now. That said, with this funding round, Zoomo wants to start developing light vehicles to address parcel delivery and other urban last-mile form factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, what this money allows us to do is to build the product muscle in our team to better research the needs of our customers,&#8221; said Nada. &#8220;We&#8217;re building the product team to now be able to do the customer research to make sure we&#8217;re replicating our success into new areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Direct-to-consumer deliveries are happening increasingly from microfulfilment centers as more shopping is done online. The best way to have faster delivery is to have those fulfilment centers closer to the customer and do deliveries on smaller form factors, like e-bikes, says Nada. But different customers will have different requirements that might require different form factors down the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re building is a company that&#8217;s going to be able to offer those different form factors to different customer types on top of our platform of software, servicing and financing,&#8221; said Nada.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micro and small businesses in emerging markets still struggle to access digital payments for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, most of them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from various payment ecosystems globally due to their size, and two, getting hardware from providers can be expensive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.-based fintech <a href="https://nomod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomod</a> allows these businesses to bypass the card terminal by providing a platform to accept card payments on their phone with no extra hardware. The company has raised $3.4 million in seed funding at a valuation of $50 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments will act as the company&#8217;s flywheel to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a merchant base and build out a financial operating system, founder and CEO <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/okassim">Omar Kassim</a> told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233595" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan for the company is to provide merchants with access to accounts, cards, local payment networks and lending. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This suite of services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is essential </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the primary markets in which Nomod is aiming to build a significant merchant base, like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bangladesh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Saudi Arabia, for instance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 3% of more than 1 million registered businesses have access to bank credit. In the UAE, it can take </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> six months to set up a business bank account. For Bangladesh, card POS hardware is pretty expensive for small and medium merchants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Nomod, merchants can start dealing with payments issues first as t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hey can download Nomod on their phones and process in-person payments and payment links from their customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can use different cards, from Visa and Mastercard to American Express and Union Pay, or go contactless via NFC and QR codes. The company also allows merchants to charge in over 135 currencies.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A merchant today can install Nomod, sign up in three or four minutes and start processing in-person and online payments using payment links,&#8221; Kassim said in a call with TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233882" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233882" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2233882" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?w=680" alt="Nomod" width="680" height="646" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg 1524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=300,285 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=768,730 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=680,646 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233882" class="wp-caption-text">Omar Kassim (Nomod CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Nomod has focused its early acquisition on merchants in the MENA and GCC region, Kassim says the platform has a global reach and allows merchants to sign up from more than 40 countries across Europe, the U.S., Australia and Asia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kassim said the company is conducting tests with merchants in Nigeria and South Africa and expects to launch both markets in the near future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our thesis is that card acceptance is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> homogenous action. Whether you&#8217;re doing it in Australia or India, or wherever, it doesn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like we can do a lot of markets in parallel, and today, we allow merchants to sign up from 44 different countries to use our platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Nomod can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and settle merchants in the U.S., the U.K and the UAE in their local currencies &#8212; dollars, pounds and dirhams, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in other markets where there is some currency fluctuation, say, in South Africa, Nomod applies some FX cost</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kassim says that once there is significant adoption in such markets, Nomod will optimize its platform for the merchants and begin acquiring and offering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> settlements in their local currencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From its <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/nomod">YC bio</a>, Nomod describes itself as &#8220;Square minus the hardware&#8221; and Kassim believes the name is telling, particularly as to how payments have evolved since Stripe launched in 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the founder, if the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$95 billion company were to launch newly, it would not need hardware</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his bias results from how payments work in emerging markets like the UAE, where most businesses carry out their fintech transactions using wallets or tokens</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The platform is one of Stripe&#8217;s <a href="https://stripe.com/partners/nomod">listed partners</a> to accept in-person payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some platforms are seeing about 60-70% of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their online transactions coming from Apple Pay. And so what you&#8217;re finding is that consumers these days actively </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tokenizing [payments] onto their device.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Nomod, Kassim ran an e-commerce marketplace platform JadoPado and sold it to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Noon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Amazon competitor in the MENA region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then worked on some consulting gigs, and after noticing the wave of fintech and neobank activity that stormed the U.K., he started Nomod as a side project in 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simple app that allowed anyone with a Stripe account to make in-person payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running the product gave him two broad ideas on how he thought payments might look in the future. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First was that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plastic cards get</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> replaced by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital tokens or native wallets in consumer fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And for fintechs targeting merchants, legacy hardware would give way to software-led solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a dominant mobile software solution for payments globally at the moment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I almost feel like there&#8217;s an opportunity for us to build like a WhatsApp or Telegram </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equivalent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for payment acceptance or face to face as well with things like payment links and subscription</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching in March 2021, Nomod has acquired </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 4,500 merchants. According to the company, its total processed volume has grown 11.5x and is on an annualized run rate of $7 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which graduated from the recent Y Combinator summer batch, received investments led by Global Founders Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other VCs such as Kingsway Capital, Goodwater Capital, and angels from the Valley and globally, including a partner from DST Global, participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jordan-based online learning platform <a href="https://abwaab.me/en/">Abwaab</a> has raised $20M in a Series A funding (following a $5M seed round in March of this year) making it one of the most funded edtech startups in the Middle East, North Africa and Pakistan (MENAP), a region that encompasses 160 million students.</p>
<p>The round was led by existing investor BECO Capital (UAE) and joined by 4DX Ventures (USA), GSV Ventures (USA), Watar Partners (KSA) and others. Founded in late 2019, the startup has expanded from Jordan into Egypt and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Founders Hamdi Tabbaa, Sabri Hakim, and Hussein AlSarabi, position their platform at secondary school students, offering content tailored to local curricula, filling the gaps in educational resources available online, while tackling the region’s high dependence on offline tutoring.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233480" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On Web and native apps, students participate in lessons, get feedback, and join discussion boards.</p>
<p>Abwaab says it has experienced strong growth during the pandemic-halted lockdown where children were unable to attend normal schooling.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233495" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233495" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Abwaab-on-tablet.jpg" alt="Abwaab on tablet" width="610" height="309" class="size-full wp-image-2233495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Abwaab-on-tablet.jpg 610w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Abwaab-on-tablet.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Abwaab-on-tablet.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Abwaab-on-tablet.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233495" class="wp-caption-text">Abwaab on tablet</p></div></p>
<p>In Jordan, where it has an active freemium subscription model, students are paying a one-off subscription to unlock access to the platform for the whole academic year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It claims to have grown by 10x in the number of active users throughout the 2020/21 academic year. It previously acquired Pakistani edtech startup Edmatrix.</p>
<p>Hamdi Tabbaa, Abwaab’s Co-founder &amp; CEO said, “Our mission since inception has been to make learning more accessible, affordable, and fun, by building a comprehensive ecosystem that changes the way students learn, while also equipping them with the tools needed to get ahead in life.”</p>
<p>BECO Capital’s Abdulaziz Shikh Al Sagha said: “Abwaab is on a clear path to establishing themselves as market leaders within the region and we are proud to have had the chance to further deepen our partnership with Hamdi, Sabri, Hussein and the whole Abwaab team.”</p>
<p>Peter Orth, Managing Partner at 4DX Ventures added: “We believe very much in Abwaab’s mission to make high quality, outcome driven education more affordable and accessible, and we believe that they are poised to become the dominant in the MENAP region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its competitors include offline tutoring centers; <a href="https://www.learnatnoon.com/jo-ar/">Noon Academy</a> (a Saudi based social learning platform; <a href="https://edkasa.com/">EdKasa</a> (Pakistan based test prep app); <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.devwork.pathfinder&#038;hl=ar&#038;gl=US">Ashtar</a> (Egypt based learning app).</p>
<p>Abwaab says it competes on the basis of offering micro-lessons that match every country&#8217;s national curriculum in bite sizes; assessments for test prep; chat or video tutoring; and a low annual USD15 subscription, which compares to the cost of one hour of tutoring.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cyber security startup Immersive Labs — which recently closed a $75 million Series C funding round giving it a significant war chest — is acquiring US-based cyber startup Snap Labs in an undisclosed deal, although Immersive says it&#8217;s a “multi-million dollar figure” and will be a mix of stock and cash. Snap Labs is understood [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cyber security startup <a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/">Immersive Labs</a> — which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/13/cyber-security-training-platform-immersive-labs-closes-75m-series-c-led-by-insight-partners/">closed</a> a $75 million Series C funding round giving it a significant war chest — is acquiring US-based cyber startup <a href="https://www.snaplabs.io/">Snap Labs</a> in an undisclosed deal, although Immersive says it&#8217;s a “multi-million dollar figure” and will be a mix of stock and cash. Snap Labs is understood to not have previously raised venture funding prior to this deal.</p>
<p>Immersive, which teaches cybersecurity skills to corporate employees by using up-to-date Cyber threat intelligence in a “gamified” way, says the deal will give them new firepower in being able to help organizations develop cyber knowledge internally.</p>
<p>With cyber switching from being a purely tech-team-led issue to becoming a company-wide, business-critical issue, Immersive’s approach seems to be garnering plenty of new business internationally. Snap Labs has a decent US footprint &#8211; it currently works with Accenture, Mandiant, and Crowdstrike &#8211; and will therefore significantly augment Immersive&#8217;s offering.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233402" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>James Hadley, CEO of Immersive Labs, said: “The acquisition of Snap Labs will allow customers to build better cyber workforces with richly detailed realistic experiences pinpointed to the risk they face.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania-based Snap Labs was founded in 2016 by Co-Founders Chris Myers and Barrett Adams.<br />
 <br />
Myers said: “The two platforms are a natural fit, and by combining them we hope to help our customers build even more resilience against cyber threats.” <br />
 <br />
There is also a climate angle to this. Snap Labs uses ‘elastic computing’ which, instead of burning power by having virtual environments continually running on a server, it spins them up only when they are being used and shuts them down immediately when not. This has a positive impact on the carbon footprint of each cyber-attack simulation, and a big impact collectively. </p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Hadley said: “The technology from Snap Labs will let us do really cool stuff for customers, namely letting companies recreate virtual versions of their own networks… We&#8217;ll let our customers create and replicate their own networks or anything they want to do, like on a really complex scale, so they can then battle test their teams against malware or penetration testing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ahhglobal/about/">Africa Health Holdings</a>, a healthcare startup running several hospitals, has secured $18 million in a Series A round, funds that will go towards building its “tech-forward healthcare system” across Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria.</p>
<p>The funding round, led by Asia Pacific Land/Natural World Limited, saw the participation of a number of investors including TRB Advisors, Breyer Capital, M3, Inc., Valiant Capital, Kepple Ventures and SUNU Capital.</p>
<p>Africa Health Holdings, based in West Africa, will use the new capital to expand its telemedicine service beyond <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/mpharma-a-telehealth-pioneer-out-of-ghana-gets-physical-with-100-virtual-centers-across-africa/">Ghana</a>, to countries like Nigeria and Kenya. This is in line with its plan to grow its portfolio beyond in-person visits and to allow electronic follow-ups through its mobile app, as more people across the continent get connected.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233948" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup’s MyCareMobile app is said to provide patients with access to a wide-range of services through teleconferencing including consultations with their doctors. This is in addition to providing access to test results, and 24-hour emergency response.</p>
<p>“Africa Health Holdings will expand by bringing its telemedicine technology to multiple countries. Currently, the telemedicine service is only in Ghana, but soon, it will be expanding to Kenya and Nigeria,” said firm’s chairman and CEO,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdelle/"> Sangu Delle</a>.</p>
<p>Delle is a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader, and a Harvard and Oxford graduate. He is also the former CEO of Golden Palm Investments; an investment holding company with an interest in early-stage opportunities in Africa.</p>
<p>He founded Africa Health Holdings to “address Africa’s disproportionate share of the global disease burden.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The TED fellow said increased demand in virtual consultations, which have grown owing to the Covid pandemic as people seek alternate ways of getting the attention of health professionals, has accelerated its plans to adopt telemedicine. Africa Health Holdings attends to about 200,000 patients annually, who use the telemedicine platform for referrals and treatment.</p>
<p>The firm now has an ambitious plan to grow its footprint within its current three markets and to explore opportunities within East, North and Southern Africa. This is in line with its plan to be the biggest healthcare provider in Africa.</p>
<p>“Always thinking about what is coming next and how to get quality healthcare to more people, Africa Health Holdings has begun investing in micro-tech-enabled clinics with virtual doctors&#8217; offices that are filled with diagnostic technologies, and nursing support, specifically for people from lower socioeconomic classes,” said Delle.</p>
<p>“Individuals are able to enter micro-tech-enabled clinics, meet with doctors virtually, consult with nurses, and receive treatment and/or referrals for additional care at a reduced cost,” he said.</p>
<p>Africa Health Holdings has three brands in three different countries; the Meridian Health Group in Kenya, Rabito Clinic in Ghana, and Nigeria’s Care Point Hospitals, all operating 40 facilities.</p>
<p>The Meridian Health Group owns 16 hospitals in Kenya including a drug and alcohol recovery center. Rabito Clinic Limited in Ghana, has 21 dermatology and general medicine facilities, while Care Point Hospitals Limited has two hospitals and a clinic in Nigeria. Africa Health Holdings also operates pharmacies and laboratories across the three countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pharmaceutical supply chain across Africa has for decades remained fragmented leading to sourcing and distribution challenges as well as quality concerns; as fake and <a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/counterfeit-drugs-africa/">substandard products</a> flood the market. Yet, these issues facing the supply chain are fixable.</p>
<p>Chibuzo Opara and Adham Yehia, being all too familiar with the problems of poor pharmaceutical supply chains, are planning to widen the reach of DrugStoc, a e-health drug procurement platform that eliminates these challenges by linking drug companies with institutions such as hospitals and pharmacies, in Nigeria.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drugstoc.com/">DrugStoc</a> is currently on an aggressive expansion plan to deliver quality pharmaceutical products to 100 million people within Nigeria, having just closed a $4.4 million series A funding. The startup plans to expand into 16 states within Nigeria as it moves to grow beyond Lagos, the economic hub of the West African country. This is besides its more grandiose plan of venturing outside Nigeria into other markets within <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/mpharma-a-telehealth-pioneer-out-of-ghana-gets-physical-with-100-virtual-centers-across-africa/">Africa</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The availability of high quality pharmaceutical products, even within Nigeria alone, means averting thousands of preventable deaths &#8212; like the loss of life linked to blood-loss during childbirth, or of children succumbing to diarrheal diseases.</p>
<p>“In Nigeria, we intend to expand beyond 14 million we currently serve to cover just around 100 million people. And this would be achieved by expanding to about 16 states. Once we are done with the heavy lifting from that expansion, we will be training our sights on other countries.”</p>
<p>DrugStoc’s funding round was led by Africa HealthCare Master Fund (AAIC). Other investors include Chicago-based venture firm Vested World, the German Development Bank (DEG) and high-net worth individuals with a keen interest in tech-health.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to be part of the DrugStoc journey. The pharmaceutical market in Africa has enormous growth potential, and we are glad to back a company that is well positioned to be a key player in the sector’s growth in sub-saharan Africa,” said AAIC director, Nobuhiko Ichimiya.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Drugstoc was founded in 2015 by Opara and Yehia, but its history dates back to 2010 when the duo founded Integra Health, a hospital management company based on Yehia’s master’s degree project. The two entrepreneurs first met as students at the Maastricht University in Holland.</p>
<p>Opara was completing his PhD studies while Yehia, who was pursuing a master’s in health innovation management, was looking for an advisor for his project when they met. Opara, who had practiced as a doctor for about six years, before switching careers to economics and finance, matched Yehia’s need for an advisor with experience in Nigeria’s healthcare sector.</p>
<p>Yehia, a geneticist who had been part of the management team of his father’s hospital in Lagos, had first-hand experience on the issues that faced hospitals in Nigeria too. And, for his masters project, he sought to explore the possible solutions for some of the challenges he saw in the industry.</p>
<p>“It was an immediate bond. So when we first met, we actually ended up spending around six hours together in my apartment, going over the problems in Nigeria’s healthcare system,” said Yehia.</p>
<p>“It was then, very early on, that we both decided that we&#8217;re going to start a company. We didn&#8217;t know what it was, but we were going to focus on trying to streamline Nigeria&#8217;s healthcare system in our lifetime &#8211; we understood that the system itself was the problem.”</p>

<p>The duo founded their first company, Integra Health, which was initially contracted to manage 20 hospitals, and during which time the gaps in Nigeria’s pharmaceutical supply chains became apparent.</p>
<p>In response, the co-founders created and piloted a tech-based platform in 2015 linking manufacturers with distributors. This plan failed to take-off as it immediately became clear that a platform alone would not suffice. The twosome changed tact in 2017, when DrugStoc was officially launched, to include distribution, after a year-long incubation at Stanford’s Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies.</p>
<p>“I think we came out of Stanford with a better understanding of business modeling and value chains than we understood it as a pilot phase,” said Yehia about the incubation program.</p>
<p>“We decided we need to get a distribution license, and to do this the pharmaceutical way. And to do this the proper way, we needed to buy directly from the manufacturers and create the value chains internally,” he said.</p>
<p>In hind-sight, Yehia noted that the tech infrastructure alone would not have solved the fragmentation problems in the pharmaceutical distribution, as they now know the important need for strategic infrastructure like fulfillment centers &#8211; warehouses from where orders are processed, packed and shipped &#8211; and customer support units.</p>
<p>DrugStoc currently links 400 manufacturers to 3,200 doctors, hospitals and pharmacies. Opara says that the platform&#8217;s monthly revenues have grown over 1,500% in the last three years; a demand brought by the quality assurance that comes with DrugStoc&#8217;s platform. The startup earns a commission for every sale made.</p>
<p>“When we started, I don&#8217;t think we ever had a doubt about the demand because we understood the scope of the problem. And we understood that people were fed up with the status quo,” said Opara.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s the fact that we are transforming not just convenience and access but also paying great attention to quality which every healthcare professional at the end of the day is bothered by, that is the underlying drive in a lot of healthcare facilities or pharmacies.”</p>
<p>In 2019, DrugStoc won a share ($65,000) of the of the inaugural $1million Africa Netpreneur Prize Initiative by the Jack Ma Foundation, a pitching competition that rewarded 10 enterprises providing solutions for the continent’s critical issues. They are also recipients of a grant from Bill and Melinda Gates, and also received seed funding from VestedWorld; an early stage investment fund with a focus on sub-Saharan market.</p>
<p>And now, with new funding, DrugStoc is expanding its coverage to more regions through more fulfillment centers and expanded transit points and routes, providing better logistic options for last mile deliveries. It is also building partnerships with financial institutions to increase access to sustainable supply chain financing. This is in addition to plans of more investments in cold chain infrastructure to enhance the safe distribution of perishable products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The commercial real estate brokerage market in South Korea is fragmented, which makes finding a new office for tenants a challenge due to inaccurate listing information, high brokerage fee and complex paperwork. <span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Seoul-based proptech startup called<a href="https://www.rsquare.co.kr/"> </a></span><a href="https://www.rsquare.co.kr/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rsquare</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> built a data-driven platform to digitize the process, enabling tenants to compare multiple properties and find an office.</span></p>
<p>The startup has raised a $72 million (85 billion won) Series C round from a single backer <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stic-investment">STIC Investments</a>, JohnWoo Lee, CEO of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rsquare">Rsquare</a>, said in an interview with TechCrunch. The latest funding brings its total raised to approximately $95 million.</p>
<p>Rsquare will spend the proceeds on advancing its AI-based proptech platform, accelerating its commercial building transaction and fulfillment centers brokerage service and increasing headcount to 400 employees by next year, Lee said. It has 354 employees as of October.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224036" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Seoul-headquartered company also plans to make further investments in the proptech sector in South Korea and Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia, Lee said. Rsquare has invested in a Vietnamese proptech startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/propzy-a-vietnamese-offline-to-online-real-estate-platform-raises-25-million-series-a/">Propzy</a> in 2020 and an Indonesian proptech company <a href="https://mamikos.com/">Mamikos</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Rsquare, which opened an office in Vietnam in June, is set to enter Singapore this month and Indonesia in 2022, Lee added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UPDATE: Los Angeles-based CREXi  raises $30 million for its online real estate marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/los-angeles-based-crexi-raises-29-million-for-its-online-real-estate-marketplace/embed/#?secret=TcAhXeZSzi" data-secret="TcAhXeZSzi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Founded in 2009, Rsquare launched its office brokerage service in 2015 to help startups find office space and has since expanded its platform to serve small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and larger corporations. In 2016, the company set up a wholly-owned subsidiary, <a href="https://www.rsquaredesign.co.kr/">Rsquare Design</a>, to provide office interior design services in the wake of $3.8 million Series B funding from Yahoo Japan Capital and SoftBank Ventures Asia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lee pointed out that Rsquare&#8217;s key differentiator is its commercial building data, including the office landlords&#8217; and tenants&#8217; information, the startup has gathered since its launch. Rsquare claims it has amassed more than 120,000 commercial building data across 50 locations in South Korea and around 10,000 commercial properties data in Vietnam. <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its real-time database provides detailed information and reduces more than 50% of time and costs compared to the traditional commercial brokers, according to the company. Rsquare</span> has handled more than 10,000 office brokerage transactions with over 21,000 clients in South Korea.</p>
<p>The pandemic has been hard on the commercial real estate market globally. Rsquare, which also grappled with the pandemic, is being recovered quickly as many Korean companies started to reopen their offices from the second half of last year, Lee said. The company posted revenue of $55.2 million in 2020 and $85 million for the previous eight months. Rsquare expects its revenue to double by the end of 2021, compared to last year, as COVID-19 lockdowns ease, according to the company.</p>
<p>As for its exit plan, Rsqaure is not planning to go public soon; Lee said it would not happen in two years. The company has been approached by global strategic investors for M&amp;A, including WeWork, about two years ago, but couldn’t find any synergy with them at the time, Lee said when asked regarding its M&amp;A possibility. Rsquare will focus on expanding its business and penetrating further into overseas markets for the next two years, Lee added.</p>

<p>“In Vietnam, micro, small and medium enterprises are the backbone of the retail economy &#8212; serving 80% of all purchases,” CEO and founder of Kilo Kartick Narayan said.</p>
<p>Kilo’s platform and tools enable the local small and medium enterprises to manage businesses across multiple sales channels, such as Kilo’s app, Facebook and<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1247591/vietnam-number-of-zalo-users/#:~:text=Zalo%20is%20an%20instant%20messaging,start%2Dups%20in%20the%20country." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Zalo</a>, and optimize inventory turnover to save costs and reduce risks over the long term.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The small and medium shop owners have a one-stop shop in which they can browse, build a cart and check out with transparent pricing a wide array of assortment and in-stock details through Kilo’s platform and tools, Narayan said.</p>
<p>Kilo was founded in 2020 by Narayan, former CMO of Groupon, vice president of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coupang">Coupang</a> and chief business officer of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tiki-vn">TIKI Corporation</a>. The startup retained thousands of MSMEs in 24 provinces across Vietnam, Ryan Wilber, Kilo’s head of product and engineering said. Kilo, which has grown its net merchandise value by 320x since launching in October 2020, targets an approximately $180 billion retail market in Vietnam, according to Narayan.</p>
<p>The Ho Chi Minh City-based startup announced today it has secured a $5 million pre-Series A to spur its growth.</p>
<p>The latest funding was co-led by Altos Ventures, marking the VC firm’s first investment in Vietnam, and January Capital, with participation from its previous backer Goodwater Capital, Ascend Vietnam Ventures, Decisive Capital Management, Ratio Ventures and other angel investors. The pre-Series A brings its total raised to $5.7 million, Narayan noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kilo will use the new capital to grow its team by 4x in the next 12 months and enhance its platform for customers. The company also plans to add features such as financing, logistics and self-service e-commerce store creation for the MSMEs.</p>
<p>“Our mission has taken on new meaning during COVID as Kilo has enabled offline MSMEs to thrive by converting the procurement process from face-to-face interactions to a contact-free, online process. Customers across the nation have been vocal about how Kilo has kept their business running and families safe during COVID,” Narayan said.</p>
<p>“They will revolutionize the traditional retail industry in Vietnam with their maniacal focus on the customer and technology. The breadth of knowledge and expertise the team brings to market is exceptional and unmatched in the region,” said Richard Song, partner at Altos Ventures.</p>
<p>“We believe strongly in supporting founders who enable MSMEs to be more successful in developing markets, an area in which Kilo has shown significant success,” said partner at January Capital Benjamin Dunphy.</p>

The company’s business model is similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/divvy-homes-secures-110m-series-c-to-help-renters-become-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Divvy Homes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/zero-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZeroDown</a> in the United States and, in fact, Divvy Homes co-founder and former CEO Brian Ma and Zerodown chief operating officer Troy Steckenrider III are investors in Homebase.</p>
<p>Participants in this round were Y Combinator (Homebase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/yc-backed-homebase-is-an-alternative-to-traditional-mortgages-for-home-buyers-in-vietnam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took part in the accelerator program earlier this year</a>), Partech Partners, Goodwater Capital, Ace and Company, Emies Advisors and Foundamental. It also included Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and operators and executives from companies like SoFi, Opendoor, Republic, Microsoft, Instacart, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Binance and others.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s existing investors include Ma, Steckenrider, VinaCapital Ventures, and Darius Cheung, the founder and CEO of 99.co, one of the largest property portals in Singapore and Indonesia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233869" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YC-backed Homebase is an alternative to traditional mortgages for home buyers in Vietnam&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/yc-backed-homebase-is-an-alternative-to-traditional-mortgages-for-home-buyers-in-vietnam/embed/#?secret=FUAs0dr4ng" data-secret="FUAs0dr4ng" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Homebase works by acting as a co-investor, buying property with clients who put in a 20% deposit. Then clients pay back a fixed amount to Homebase each month, or can decide to buy out the company&#8217;s entire share. They can also chose to walk away from the deal and cash out their savings.</p>
<p>Clients have full usage rights to the home, so they can live in it or rent it. Contracts range from one to 10 years and An says people who buy homes to live in often chose 10 year contracts, while investors usually go for about three years, so they can see how the market appreciates before selling the property.</p>
<p>Homebase will use its new funding to continue developing its proprietary technology, form more partnerships with real estate developers and hiring. The company says it has doubled its headcount over the past year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of its technology, co-founder and COO Phillip An told TechCrunch, “a lot of it is how do we improve the customer experience and make it more customer-centric? Right now in Vietnam, buying property is really painful. It’s like 100 steps, you have to sign in blue ink on paper, at the bottom of every page. We’re thinking of how do you make the experience of buying a home or investing a one-stop shop where you can do everything digitally.”</p>

<p>He added Homebase is also thinking about developing asset valuation tools to help homeowners and passive investors gauge the value of their properties.</p>
<p>An said Homebase’s client base is split 50/50 between people who want a home and investors, including foreign buyers who can’t travel to Vietnam because of the pandemic and rely on Homebase to perform transactions for them.</p>
<p>“The concept of owning your own home is quite important culturally and if you look at the economy, real estate is one of the most popular types of investment,” said An. “People are investing more and more in crypto and stocks, especially during COVID, but I would say real estate still makes a really big portion of what people put their money in. And if you look at the historical track record of real estate in Vietnam, it’s really good.”</p>
<p>Homebase cites research from real estate consultancy <a href="https://www.cbrevietnam.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBRE</a> that showed that increases in average landed property prices grew from 3% to 17% year-over-year, even during Vietnam’s COVID-19 lockdowns during the third quarter. This is good news for people who already own property, but means it is increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to secure mortgages.</p>
<p>Homebase works with agents and developers as a value-add service that helps them close more deals. “For a lot of agents, among the biggest hurdle for them is that clients cannot qualify for a mortgage right away because of the barriers. After COVID, I would say banks became even more strict in terms of criteria. Sometimes they require a 40% to 50% down payment.”</p>
<p>Having Homebase to buy property on behalf of a client makes the process more efficient and as a result, agents sometimes offer buyers a discount if use the startup’s services, An said.</p>

<p>The company will continue focusing on Vietnam over the next few months by expanding into more cities (it currently operates in Ho Chi Minh City, Saigon, Hanoi and Danang). It is also exploring other Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
<p>“Investors, even customers have reached out to us on social media and asked if we’re available in their country, so I think there is a lot of customer demand for these types of services that help make affording a home more accessible,” An said.</p>
<p>In a statement about his investment in Homebase, Siebel said, “We’ve seen many innovative proptech companies at YC from around the world, and Homebase is among those leading towards a significantly better and more customer-centric solution versus current options, and radically transforms accessibility for aspiring homeowners.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://mimica.ai">Mimica</a>, which (perhaps oddly enough) <em>automates</em> Robotic Process Automation, has raised a $6 million Series A funding from Khosla Ventures. The company will use the funds to establish a sales team in the US and build out its product. Previous Seed investors included the UK’s Entrepreneur First accelerator and the Episode 1 VC.</p>
<p>Mimica’s first product, Mapper, operates in the realm of “process discovery”, which “learns patterns from employee clicks and keystrokes” thus generating process maps normally take business analysts months to produce via manual effort. In other words, it automates the process of automation.</p>
<p>Mimica has RPA teams who build software bots that complete repetitive tasks such as data entry, form completion, and claim and ticket processing – a market estimated to be worth $107 billion by 2027. However, the company argues that RPA giants like UiPath are hard to implement in practice, and its own software would speed this up.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233447" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233466" style="width: 661px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233466" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg" alt="Mimica team" width="651" height="380" class="size-full wp-image-2233466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg 651w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233466" class="wp-caption-text">Mimica team</p></div></p>
<p>Mimica says its AI removes these bottlenecks by automatically discovering opportunities for automation and generating process maps for bots that can accelerate development.</p>
<p>CEO Tuhin Chakraborty and CTO Raphael Holca-Lamarre co-founded Mimica in 2017. Holca-Lamarre did a PhD in computational neuroscience and machine learning. Chakraborty studied machine learning at Stanford and earned a patent for a supervised learning model he developed at LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Since launching in 2020, Mimica has worked with Dell, AT&amp;T, Hexaware, Experis and Ironbridge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chakraborty said: “RPA is the perfect beachhead for our tech because buyers experience so much pain after their purchases. It’s torture, digging for automation opportunities and building process maps by hand, and it’s unnecessary.”</p>
<p>Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, said: “We invested in Mimica because the founding team has a terrific combination of deep technical expertise in building AI systems, and a thorough understanding of the challenges faced by an enterprise when managing processes.”</p>
<p>Mimica competes with FortressIQ and Skan &#8212; both US companies. Other players like UiPath and Celonis are building competing solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last 20 months of living in the midst of Covid-19, with all its unexpected developments, have been a challenge for many organizations when it comes to planning for the future. But that has also presented an opportunity for tech: build tools to make planning and forecasting, even in the midst of a pandemic, easier and more effective. To that end, <a href="https://www.gopigment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pigment</a> &#8212; a Paris startup that has built a platform to help organizations better visualize data and use it to power better business planning and forecasting &#8212; has been seeing a surge of business, and today it is announcing a Series B of $73 million to fuel its growth, both in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Its mission, CEO and co-founder Eléonore Crespo said in an interview, is not just to make it easier to use big datasets in more strategic ways, but to use its intuitive approach to take on the behemoth of Excel &#8212; estimated at over 1 billion users &#8212; and other generic spreadsheet programs, to become the go-to planning and forecasting platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighty percent of use cases are still done in Excel,&#8221; Crespo said. &#8220;We have built the most powerful engine in market, providing simplicity in what is a complex process.&#8221; The approach is about replacing the ubiquitous spreadsheet interface with drag and drop elements to manipulate business data so that anyone, including non-technical people, could use it, she added, &#8220;a little like Lego.&#8221; Starting first in finance and revenue, the plan will be to build modeling and forecasting templates that can be used in a variety of business departments, including HR, sales and marketing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233861" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The round is being led by Greenoaks, with previous backers FirstMark Capital and Blossom Capital also participating. Blossom led Pigment&#8217;s $26 million Series A in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/taking-on-the-business-scenario-planning-giants-pigment-raises-a-25-9m-series-a-led-by-blossom-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Pigment is not disclosing its valuation with this round, but for some context, it was valued at $112 million in its Series A, per <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/435866-68/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> data.</p>
<p>With customer traction, Pigment&#8217;s sweet spot up to now has been working with fast-scaling businesses with a strong play specifically in the world of tech, where its customers include Algolia, Gong, Melio, Deliveroo, Spendesk, Blablacar, and Cheerz &#8212; precisely the kind of organizations that are both amassing large amounts of data about how the business is running, and in strong need of tools to help make better sense of that data, to use it to have a better idea of what the future might hold.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the reasons Pigment plays so squarely into that use case is because that was some of the impetus behind why it was founded in the first place. Crespo previously was an investor at Index Ventures (and before that a data analyst at Google) and her co-founder Romain Niccoli was previously the CTO and co-founder of adtech giant Criteo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At Criteo, she said, Niccoli&#8217;s &#8220;biggest nightmare&#8221; was that technical, sales and other departments were tapping into very powerful tools to handle data modeling and forecasting, but in areas like revenue and finance, &#8220;They were still using Excel for super strategic data.&#8221; That posed a huge problem since Excel was never originally designed to be used in that way, and it hadn&#8217;t evolved to meet that demand and heavy use.</p>
<p>Crespo found the same, she said, both at Index when trying to evaluate information, and at Index&#8217;s portfolio companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;All these companies that were fast-growing, preparing for IPOs, and we&#8217;d see them running strategic cases on spreadsheets,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;It just didn’t work. Excel would just break. It wasn&#8217;t secure. I thought there should be a better way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pigment does this by first of all providing a wide range of connectors to integrate data from a variety of other platforms, including Snowflake, Netsuite, Looker, Workday, Salesforce, Google Sheets and &#8220;dozens&#8221; of others, Crespo said. It then provides a set of tools so that teams and partners can view, collaborate and provide feedback on data. For those that already use Excel, they can work on data in Pigment using &#8220;Excel syntax&#8221; to show trends in the data. It also provides a range of big data analytics tools behind the scenes so that users can then run multiple &#8220;what-if&#8221; scenarios on the data to compare different financial outcomes when and if conditions change.</p>
<p>There are, of course, a number of different companies, both old and new, that have been tackling the world of business planning with software to make it easier to do this. They include the likes of Anaplan, DataRails, Workday (related to the specific area of HR), Oracle, IBM, Looker, and even newer players in the more general spreadsheet landscape like Airtable. Interestingly, two of Pigment&#8217;s angel investors, Paul Melchiorre and David Clarke, respectively come from two of those competitors, Anaplan and Workday. (Melchiorre had been the CEO of Anaplan, and Clarke is the former CTO of Workday.)</p>
<p>“I’ve been in the enterprise planning business since my time at SAP in the early 1990s. I recently led the largest player in the space, and I can honestly say that Pigment’s platform is the most flexible and comprehensive,&#8221; Melchiorre said in a statement. &#8220;Pigment will be transformative for the start-up ecosystem because it will be at the core of successful and sustainable growth strategies, tailor made for the next generation of leaders. It will allow them to deliver on high expectations set by increasing levels of funding, and plan for uncertain scenarios while being socially and environmentally mindful.”</p>
<p>That endorsement, and the startup&#8217;s growth, are behind this latest round.</p>
<p>“Financial planning &amp; analysis is a critical business function.  But today, most companies rely on software that hasn&#8217;t evolved in years — either outdated spreadsheets that are inflexible and don&#8217;t scale, or expensive and overly-complex FP&amp;A suites that require an industry of consultants to support them. Today&#8217;s businesses demand agile and intelligent tools that will help them make better decisions more quickly,&#8221; said Neil Shah, at Greenoaks Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We believe that the company will rapidly become the market’s clear leader in planning software, building faster and for broader use cases than any competitor, and delighting their customers along the way.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Philippines-based <a href="https://plentina.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plentina</a>, a buy now, pay later startup focused on emerging markets, announced today it has raised $2.2 million. This brings the fintech’s total funding since it was founded in 2019, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/philippines-buy-now-pay-later-startup-plentina-raises-2-2m-seed-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seed round announced in April</a>, to $5.7 million. The latest funding was led by TMV, with participation from Global Founders Capital and returning investors AV Ventures, Techstars and Unpopular Ventures.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used to speed-track Plentina’s growth in the Philippines, expand its product and start exploring launches in other countries, including Vietnam. The company is targeting a Series A raise next year and will hire senior talent before then.</p>
<p>In addition to its BNPL platform, Plentina also plans to focus on other data-driven financial services (its co-founders, Kevin Gabayan and Earl Valencia, are data scientists whose combined work experience include positions at Google and Charles Schwab). The two note that the Philippines has a population of more than 100 million people, but less than 5% of access to credit cards.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233865" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The company says that in 2021, Plentina’s Android app downloads have increased by 500%, growing from 30,000 users to over 150,000. It plans to launch an iOS app early next year.</p>
<p>When Plentina launched in the Philippines last October, it initially focused on daily needs, signing partnerships with vendors like 7-Eleven and telecom Smart Communications. Since then, it has added more than 20 brands to its platform and more categories. These include necessities like food, groceries and education supplies, but also things like airline tickets, gaming and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Its merchants include e-commerce platforms and offline retailers, like Isetann Supermarket, Lazada, Zalora, Shopee, Agoda, McDonald’s, Philippine Airlines, Razer E-Pins and National Bookstores. The company says it has a waitlist of more than 20 brands waiting to onboard to its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plentina also added new loan terms. When TechCrunch last covered the company in April, its required repayment within 14 days. Now Plentina has extended its BNPL offers to three months, since it has options for larger-value items, like airline tickets and e-commerce purchases.</p>
<p>The company will start its international expansion next year. “We are guided by our mission to democratize financial services to emerging markets, so we are planning to expand to Vietnam in 2022,” Valencia told TechCrunch. “We will apply lessons in launching and scaling in our first market of the Philippines.” He added that Plentina has already recruited a leadership team in Vietnam to launch operations.</p>
<p>In a statement, TMV founder and general partner Soraya Darabi said, “Kevin and Earl are precisely the entrepreneurs we look to back as investors. They have the domain discipline to be focused on this audacious opportunity, the tenacity to see it through to success. We are enthusiastically partnering with them to bring robust financial services to the Philippines and beyond.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9siTmbnUcI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>My favorite show right now is Succession, the fictionalization of the Murdoch family and its media empire. It’s relentlessly funny, as the patriarch and children vie for being the most reprehensible. It’s a big tie; each of the principals vacillates between nervous self-doubt and over the top belief that they are somehow close to omnipotent in the struggle for control of the family business. Characters from last season who seemed somewhat exaggerated are this year normalized in their interactions with the others. My favorite is one of the Culkins, who uses the Culkin look to explain how he interchangeably got the part. It reminds me of Bogart, who history remembers a star because there’s no way of prying his strength as an actor apart from the cumulative roles he played. Of all the gin joints&#8230;.</p>
<p>These were the early catchphrases, before Bill Cosby and his Noah routine with God, and Bob Newhart’s phone conversations with himself. Buy the setup, buy the bit. Kubrick further compressed this in Dr. Strangelove with Peter Sellers&#8217; “precious bodily fluids.” Then George Harrison in Hard Days Night: &#8220;She’s a drag, a well known drag&#8230;&#8221; George Martin had produced live albums with the Goons, and Richard Lester when he and Sellers directed the Goons’ short film. Now it was the two first Beatle films. Hard Days Night was black and white, the feel of the French New Wave with lightweight cameras and location photography seamlessly intertwined with Kubrick’s 2001 Space Opera. Each method informed the other. The onboard computer HAL in 2001 used the same laconic detached attitude (I’m sorry, Dave. I can’t do that) to reject his captive astronaut, that George Harrison did when threatened with losing the part he was ostensibly up for (I don’t care.) Each was a role reversal, as the Beatle took over from the arrogant adman whose office he’d wandered into, and the computer took over from his ostensible human boss. HAL is not sorry, and George really doesn’t care.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233808" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Forgive me if I’m wrong, but the other shoe dropped as Clubhouse released Replay. It doesn’t let you record private sessions, or even sessions visible only to those you’ve followed. Makes sense for promoting the people (called creators) who think their work should be preserved or post-produced as we do to add music and titles. I do care about these things, and suspect there are lots of others who do too. Catchphrases stick because the combination of rhythm and resignation (I don&#8217;t care) produces a calming effect. Many enjoy podcasts, but I prefer the serendipity of conversation to the mountain made out of a molehill. Streaming may replace podcasts as the government deems broadband an inalienable right. What&#8217;s left to determine is the economic model that incentivizes production.</p>
<p>By default, Clubhouse record is enabled if the session is public. Upon completion, each speaker&#8217;s profile adds a link to the room. If you are the host of the room, you can download an MP4 and post produce it, but my favorite is to share a link to a notification stream like Twitter or a newsletter. By clicking on the Listen To button, you can listen to the session and skip forward from speaker to speaker. So, three steps: start a room, share the conversation, and follow the thread as it forks over the social networking landscape. Low friction, ubiquitous tools and broadband, and the economic model of establishing trust in the fruits of collaboration. Not bad for a few good minutes in the gig/creator economy.</p>
