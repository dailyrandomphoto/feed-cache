										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/02/apple-music-memos-voice-memos-integration/">officially discontinued</a> Music Memos, an iPhone app that allowed musicians to quickly record audio and develop new song ideas. Now, a new startup called <a href="https://tape.it/">Tape It</a> is stepping in to fill the void with an app that improves audio recordings by offering a variety of features, including higher-quality sound, automatic instrument detection, support for markers, notes, and images, and more.</p>
<p>The idea for Tape It comes from two friends and musicians, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tcwalther/">Thomas Walther</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-n-2559b2116/">Jan Nash</a>.</p>
<p>Walther had previously spent three and a half years at Spotify, following its 2017 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/spotify-acquires-audio-detection-startup-sonalytic/">acquisition of the audio detection startup Sonalytic</a>, which he had co-founded. Nash, meanwhile, is a classically trained opera singer, who also plays bass and is an engineer.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re joined by designer and musician <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christiancrusius/">Christian Crusius</a>, previously of the design consultancy Fjord, which was <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/industries/communications/accenture-completes-acquisition-of-fjord-expanding-digital-and-marketing-capabilities.htm">acquired</a> by Accenture.</p>
<p>The founders, who had played in a band together for many years, were inspired to build Tape It because it was something they wanted for themselves, Walther says. After ending his stint at Spotify working in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/17/spotify-acquires-online-music-studio-soundtrap/">their new Soundtrap division</a> (an online music startup Spotify also bought in 2017), he knew he wanted to work on a project that was more focused on the music-making side of things. But while Soundtrap worked for some, it wasn&#8217;t what either Walther or his friends had needed. Instead, they wanted a simple tool that would allow them to record their music with their phone &#8212; something that musicians often do today using Apple&#8217;s Voice Memos app and, briefly, Music Memos &#8212; until its demise.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199782" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199782" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2199782" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-3.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-3.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-3.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-3.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-3.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-3.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-3.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199782" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tape It</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Regardless of whether you&#8217;re an amateur or even like a touring professional&#8230;you will record your ideas with your phone, just because that&#8217;s what you have with you,&#8221; Walther explains. &#8220;It&#8217;s the exact same thing with cameras &#8212; the best camera is the one you have with you. And the best audio recording tool is the one you have with you.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That is, when you want to record, the easiest thing to do is not to get out your laptop and connect a bunch of cables to it, then load up your studio software &#8212; it&#8217;s to hit the record button on your iPhone.</p>
<p>The Tape It app allows you to do just that, but adds other features that make it more competitive with its built-in competition, Voice Memos.</p>
<p>When you record using Tape It, the app leverages A.I. to automatically detect the instrument, then annotate the recording with a visual indication to make those recordings easier to find by looking for the colorful icon. Musicians can also add their own markers to the files right when they record them, then add notes and photos to remind themselves of other details. This can be useful when reviewing the recordings later on, Walther says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199783" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199783" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2199783" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-2.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Photo-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199783" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tape It</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;If I have a nice guitar sound, I can just take a picture of the settings on my amplifier, and I have them. This is something musicians do all the time,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;It&#8217;s the easiest way to re-create that sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another novel, but simple, change in Tape It is that breaks longer recordings into multiple lines, similar to a paragraph of text. The team calls this the &#8220;Time Paragraph,&#8221; and believes it will make listening to longer sessions easier than the default &#8212; which is typically a single, horizontally scrollable recording.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2199785" style="width: 333px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199785" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2199785" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tape.png?w=323" alt="" width="323" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tape.png 1580w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tape.png?resize=71,150 71w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tape.png?resize=142,300 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tape.png?resize=768,1618 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tape.png?resize=323,680 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tape.png?resize=729,1536 729w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tape.png?resize=972,2048 972w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tape.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199785" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tape It</p></div></p>
<p>The app has also been designed so it&#8217;s easier to go back to the right part of recordings, thanks to its smart waveforms, in addition to the optional markers and photos. And you can mark recordings as favorites so you can quickly pull up a list of your best ideas and sounds. The app offers full media center integration as well, so you can play back your music whenever you have time.</p>
<p>However, the standout feature is Tape It&#8217;s support for &#8220;Stereo HD&#8221; quality. Here, the app takes advantage of the two microphones on devices like the iPhone XS, XR, and other newer models, then improves the sound using A.I. technology and other noise reduction techniques which it&#8217;s developed in-house. This feature is part of its $20 per year premium subscription.</p>
<p>Over time, Tape It intends to broaden its use of A.I. and other IP to improve the sound quality further. It also plans to introduce collaborative features and support for importing and exporting recordings into professional studio software. This could eventually place Tape It into the same market that SoundCloud had initially chased before it shifted its focus to becoming more of a consumer-facing service.</p>
<p>But first, Tape It wants to nail the single-user workflow before adding on more sharing features.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided that it&#8217;s so important to make sure it&#8217;s useful, even just for you. The stuff that you can collaborate on &#8212; if you don&#8217;t like using it yourself, you&#8217;re not going to use it,&#8221; Walther says.</p>
<p>Tape It&#8217;s team of three is dually based in both Stockholm and Berlin and is currently bootstrapping.</p>
<p>The app itself is a free download on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tape-it-songwriting/id1576341885">iOS</a> and will later support desktop users on Mac and Windows. An Android version is not planned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Conversational AI” startup <a href="https://poly-ai.com/">PolyAI</a>, based out of London, has raised $14 million in a funding round led by Silicon Valley&#8217;s Khosla Ventures, with participation from existing investors (Point72 Ventures, Amadeus Capital, Sands Capital Ventures, Passion Capital and Entrepreneur First). This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/polyai/">follows</a> their $12m Series A, and will provide resources for further US expansion beyond its existing US team. The startup has now raised $28m to date.</p>
<p>PolyAI builds and deploys voice assistants for automating customer services, which, claims the startup, sound like real humans. This helps companies get an infinite and cheaper supply of their best human voice operators, which reduces customer waiting times, and increases customer satisfaction and retention, says the company.</p>
<p>Co-founder Dr Nikola Mrkšić said: “The technical term for our technology is ‘multi-turn conversational AI’, but all the caller has to do is talk to it, like they would to a human. Compared to existing call centers, our assistants can boost customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores by up to 40% and reduce handling times by up to five minutes.”</p>
<p>“We build these systems very quickly (relative to the competition) — we get experiences like these up and running in 2-4 weeks thanks to our transformer-based language understanding models and the underlying dialog management platform,” he added.</p>
<p>In a statement, Vinod Khosla said: “PolyAI is one of the first AI companies using the newest generation of large pre-trained deep learning models (akin to BERT and GPT-3) in a real-world enterprise product. This means they can deploy automated AI agents in as little as two weeks, where incumbent providers of voice assistants would take up to six months to deploy an older version of this technology.”</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZTO_-nWRHM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>A spinout from the University of Cambridge, PolyAI says it is is effectively ’pushing at an open door’ as the pandemic has led to staffing shortages in call centers, driving more companies to deploy smart voice assistants, which appear not to have been replaced chatbots at all, as consumer generally prefer to speak than type.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We were expecting the system to handle 40% of calls, but at launch it handled 80%, and within two weeks it was up to 87%,” said Brian Jeppesen of Landry’s Golden Nugget Hotels &amp; Casinos. “Callers think the AI agent is human”, Jeppesen continued, “which is great because the voice assistant never has a bad day, and is on 24/7. I wish I could hire more agents like that!”</p>
<p>Competitors include Nuance (recently acquired by Microsoft), IPSoft, Interactions, SmartAction, and Replicant. But PolyAI says its voice assistant can be turned live more quickly, in more languages, and charges on a per-minute basis.</p>
<p>Founded by Nikola Mrkšić (CEO), Tsung-Hsien Wen (CTO), Pei-Hao Su (Engineering Director), the three met while doing PhDs with Professor Steve Young, a leader in spoken dialog systems who pioneered many technologies that underpin voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa.</p>
<p>Recent PolyAI clients include Landry’s Entertainment, Greene King, Starling Bank, and Viasat. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you’re in the mood for a pep talk, who better to turn to than a well-networked, optimistic mentor who is naturally in your corner? That friendly shoulder is the role that &#8220;Masters of Scale&#8221; wants to play.</p>
<p>Inspired by LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner Reid Hoffman’s hit podcast, the new book, co-authored by Hoffman along with podcast executive producers June Cohen and Deron Triff, came out this week. Riddled with anecdotes and actionable takeaways, the book’s strength is wholly related to the sheer diversity of entrepreneurs that are represented in the text. Beyond sticking to tech leaders, the book draws lessons from Spanx founder Sara Blakely, Starbucks founder Howard Schultz and Union Square Hospitality Group CEO Daniel Meyer. Like any good mentor, the book is realistic. Mentors know you aren’t Bumble’s Whitney Wolfe Herd or Airbnb’s Brian Chesky yet, but can extract universally applicable lessons from those leaders so that you can relate to them.</p>
<p>While press wasn’t a main character in the book, &#8220;Master of Scale&#8221; has already changed my perspective on how I interview founders. Lessons from Tristan Walker made me want to ask more questions about founders, and their most controversial beliefs, rather than how they plan to spend their new round of funding. A note from Andrés Ruzo made me realize that a startup that makes too much sense might be a comfortable read, but it might not be a moonshot that disrupts the world; in other words, pursue the startups that have too much seemingly foolish ambition &#8212; because they may be where the best strides, and stories, are made. Finally, it confirmed my belief that the best litmus test for a founder is if they are willing to talk about the hardships ahead of them in an honest, humble way.</p>
<p>Through every feel-good story, I waited for the pandemic to be addressed. The pandemic’s impact on startup advice was largely isolated to a single chapter about the art of the pivot. Instead of interspersing advice on how to deal with the pandemic’s impact on venture capital, funding and markets more broadly, the book limited its references to the cataclysmic event. This choice keeps the advice smartly evergreen. That said, I felt like the book’s choice to not talk much about the ugly within startupland creates an imbalance of sorts. It would have benefitted from talking directly about divisive dynamics, ranging from how WeWork’s Adam Neumann impacted the way we talk about visionary founders, Brian Armstrong’s Coinbase memo and what it means for startup culture, or even the role of the tech press today. One could argue that the book never claims to be journalistic, and instead wanted to play the role of a cheerleading mentor, not a cynical one.</p>
<p>Writing a book based on a hit podcast isn’t necessarily a walk in the park. Audio is an entirely different medium from written text, and it takes a certain finesse to translate into text the charisma and humility of vocal banter. Hoffman and the authors thus certainly shine brighter in some stories than others, leaning heavily on a repeated, yet effective storytelling arc throughout the text: introduce problem, present aha moment, offer solutions and share universal lessons.</p>
<p>I read the book over a weekend; I recommend the same move for any aspiring entrepreneur, techie or startup journalist looking to pick up a copy. Reid and the coauthors will do a fantastic job connecting the dots of over 70 entrepreneurs for you, but the real magic will come from what happens when you pause in between the stories &#8212; either to Google a founder you resonate with, to change up your interview style or to finally start working on the idea you one day may just blitzscale.</p>

		Artem Milinchuk is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://farmtogether.com/">FarmTogether</a>, a fintech platform channeling funding into natural assets, starting with U.S. farmland.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Farmland as an asset class has proven itself to be a stable investment decade after decade. <a href="https://farmland.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Correlation-Farmland-Utility-Center-2021.xlsm">Farmland’s negative correlation</a> with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sits at an eye-popping -43% for a three-year hold period, making it an excellent hedge against market volatility.</p>
<p>The asset has also been a steady <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Trends_in_U.S._Agriculture/Land_Values/index.php">appreciator since 1987</a>, when institutional investors began incorporating farmland into their portfolios. Equally, investments into sustainably managed farmland have the potential to transform agriculture from one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions to one of the largest carbon sinks.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			While farmland investments can provide passive income and a hedge during just about any economic condition, direct investments into the asset have been largely inaccessible to date.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>However, while farmland is among the oldest investment classes around, the average investor hasn’t had access to farmland the way that billionaires and institutional investors have.</p>
<p>Revolutions in fintech and a host of startups are changing this.</p>
<h2>Why farmland?</h2>
<p>COVID-19 affected the world in ways we couldn’t have predicted, and the markets were no exception. The <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/stock-market-and-economy-insights-covid-19-crisis">S&amp;P 500 plummeted in mid-March</a> and shed 34% of its pre-COVID peak value. But unlike past crises, the index rebounded just a month later.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that financial markets have fully recovered, however. We’ve seen <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/articles/how-to-handle-volatility">plenty of volatility</a> since, both in the form of rallies and losses. This has caused many investors to move some of their portfolio out of equities.</p>
<p>This is where farmland entered the discussion.</p>

<h2>A historically stable asset class</h2>
<p>Wild stock market fluctuations existed well before COVID-19. The <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/goldilocks-keynes-and-fluctuations-in-the-stock-market">latest era of volatility</a> began in 2018 and continued even as the economy grew prior to the pandemic. Given the unpredictability of the equities market, investors need to counterbalance what’s in store for stocks and funds.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. produces more new <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4733/startups-worldwide/">startups and unicorns</a> each year than any other country in the world, but <a href="https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-failure-rate">90% of startups fail</a>, with cash flow often being a major challenge.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs trying to raise funding for their new businesses are faced with a maze of options, with most taking the common route of equity rounds. There’s clearly <a href="https://www.abladvisor.com/news/30176/vc-investment-in-u-s-hits-new-record-high-in-2020-kpmg">a lot of venture money</a> to be raised — and most tech entrepreneurs happily take it in exchange for equity. This works for some, but too often founders find themselves diluting their equity to unrecoverable portions rather than considering other financing options that allow them to hold on to their company — options like debt capital.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Even if you’re growing quickly, not all founders want to set a valuation for their company. In that case, you can offer investors &#8220;convertible debt.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Despite the VC flurries of 2020 creating an ecosystem of seemingly endless equity, it’s important for entrepreneurs and founders to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all model for raising capital. Debt capital, which refers to capital raised by taking out a loan, is an alternative route that entrepreneurs should consider.</p>
<p>Understanding the real cost of venture debt and when it makes more sense than the traditional equity route relies on an understanding of what you and your company hope to achieve.</p>
<h2>Understanding your goals</h2>
<p>We mainly see two kinds of startups today: Those that want to try something new, and the ones that focus on making things faster, cheaper or simpler. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are good examples of the first kind — social media didn’t exist before the internet. Discount airlines, cell phones (not smartphones) and integrated circuits are good examples of the “faster, cheaper, simpler” variety, because they simply displaced familiar incumbents.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are eager to be the next “try something new” success story, and I applaud them for feeling that way. Carving out your own market is a fast-track to entrepreneurial stardom if you’re successful. But unless your main goal is to be famous, it’s often impractical and distracting.</p>
<p>People tend to think that category creation is less risky than incumbent disruption. However, as long as you’re truly faster, cheaper and simpler, patience and strategy can propel you to where you want to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as there are different market approaches, there are a number of funding strategies that work best for your goals. Landing investments from leading VC firms has benefits and is a good avenue to opt for if you’re a young startup carving out a market and in need of validation and experience. These firms bring trusted advisers that are laser-focused on growth and have the resources and experience to navigate the murky waters of category creation.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> CEO Brian Armstrong has reacted strongly to the company’s current relationship with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to him, the SEC is threatening to sue the cryptocurrency exchange if it launches its yield-generating product called <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/lend">Coinbase Lend</a>.</p>
<p>With this new product, Coinbase wants to compete with popular decentralized finance (DeFi) products, such as <a href="https://compound.finance">Compound</a> and <a href="https://aave.com">Aave</a>. The company wants to operate a lending pool focused on USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin that is pegged to USD.</p>
<p>If the company manages to launch Coinbase Lend, users will be able to contribute to the lending pool by sending crypto assets to Coinbase Lend. Eventually, the company plans to lend out those crypto assets. Coinbase users get high interest rates in exchange to contributing to the lending pool. Coinbase promises 4% APY on its <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/lend">preview page</a>.</p>
<p>According to Brian Armstrong, the company reached out to the SEC before releasing it. “They responded by telling us this lend feature is a security,” he said <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439543692365828">on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>“They refuse to tell us why they think it&#8217;s a security, and instead subpoena a bunch of records from us (we comply), demand testimony from our employees (we comply), and then tell us they will be suing us if we proceed to launch, with zero explanation as to why,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439621190471683">added</a>.</p>
<p>Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal also wrote about the events on the <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009">company’s blog</a>. It appears that the company decided to move forward and pre-announce the new feature despite the SEC saying that Coinbase’s Lend program is a security.</p>
<p>“The SEC told us they consider Lend to involve a security, but wouldn’t say why or how they’d reached that conclusion. Rather than get discouraged, we chose to continue taking things slowly. In June, we announced our Lend program publicly and opened a waitlist but did not set a public launch date,” Grewal <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a pro tip for entrepreneurs reading this post: If the SEC tells you that you can’t launch something, don’t put up a waitlist with the words &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To no one’s surprise, Coinbase says that the SEC decided to open a formal investigation after that. <em>One</em> employee also had to spend a day with the SEC to answer questions.</p>
<p>“They asked for documents and written responses, and we willingly provided them. They also asked for us to provide a corporate witness to give sworn testimony about the program. As a result, one of our employees spent a full day in August providing complete and transparent testimony about Lend,” Grewal wrote.</p>
<p>As a result, Coinbase is now mad and has chosen to launch a PR campaign against the SEC. Brian Armstrong’s main argument is that other companies have been offering lending pools already, so there’s no reason why some companies can offer such a product and not Coinbase.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer a lend feature, but Coinbase is somehow not allowed to,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435440007787921413">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>This is a risky strategy as Coinbase could end up alienating the crypto ecosystem at large. There could be increased scrutiny on DeFi and industrywide enforcement of stricter rules, as Sar Haribhakti <a href="https://twitter.com/sarthakgh/status/1435629740392652802">pointed out</a>.</p>
<p>“Ostensibly the SEC&#8217;s goal is to protect investors and create fair markets. So who are they protecting here and where is the harm? People seem pretty happy to be earning yield on these various products, across lots of other crypto companies,” Brian Armstrong <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435440225560371200">said</a>.</p>
<p>If you read the fine print, Coinbase doesn’t protect investors with its Lend program. Here’s what it says <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/lend">at the bottom of the Coinbase Lend page</a>: “Lend is not a high-yield USD savings account, and Coinbase is not a bank. Your loaned crypto is not protected by FDIC or SIPC insurance.”</p>
<p>That’s not very reassuring for investors. At some point, Coinbase and the SEC will have to sit at the same table to discuss crypto lending products because a tweetstorm won&#8217;t solve the issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is a useful place for following breaking news and keeping up with what the people you&#8217;re already interested in are doing, but its relative dearth of discovery features and a lack of organized community spaces make it pretty hard to connect with anyone you aren&#8217;t actively seeking out.</p>
<p>The company is thinking about changing that. Twitter is on a tear with new features lately and its latest experiment, called Communities, is designed to make it easier to connect around shared interests. Users will be able to join these new social hubs and tweet directly to other people with shared interests rather than their regular group of followers. Those tweets will still be public, but replies will be limited to other community members.</p>
<p>Communities will be user generated, though Twitter says that will be &#8220;limited,&#8221; for now, so most people will have to wait a few months before starting their own groups. The earliest Communities will center around popular and generally benign topics on Twitter including &#8220;dogs, weather, sneakers, skincare, and astrology.&#8221; Twitter&#8217;s example images also include cryptocurrency, plants and Black women photographers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2199470" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/twitter-communities.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /></p>
<p>The test begins Wednesday and will show up in a dedicated spot at the bottom of the iOS app or in the side menu on Twitter.com. Twitter says that Android users will be able to read Community tweets too, though &#8220;more functionality&#8221; is on the way soon — presumably a dedicated app tab and the ability to join and participate in the new groups.</p>
<p>Communities will be created and maintained by designated moderators, who will have the ability to invite other users to the group via DM and remove content posted within the group. Initially invites will be the only way into a Community, but it sounds like Twitter has some grand plans for discovery features that make it easier for people to find places they might want to hang out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some conversations aren’t for everyone, just the people who want to talk about the thing you want to talk about,&#8221; Twitter Staff Product Manager David Regan wrote in a blog post announcing the feature. &#8221; … We want to continue to support public conversation and help people find Communities that match their interests, while also creating a more intimate space for conversation.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2199474" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/twitter-communities-2.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /></p>
<p>With any user-driven community space on social media — particularly one where algorithmic discovery factors in — moderation is the big concern. Twitter says that anyone will be able to read, report and quote content posted in a Community, so you don&#8217;t have to be a member of a community to flag harmful content like you would in a private Facebook group. Twitter says that it is working on &#8220;new reporting flows, and bespoke enforcement actions&#8221; to proactively identify problem Communities.</p>
<p>The introduction of Communities pairs well with Twitter&#8217;s recent efforts to court creator communities. The company rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">Super Follows</a>, its paid subscription tool, earlier this month and also recently invited some users to sell tickets for audio rooms with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/twitter-starts-to-roll-out-paid-ticketed-spaces-on-ios/">Ticketed Spaces</a>. It&#8217;s also testing one-time payments with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">a feature called Tip Jar</a> that&#8217;s currently only available for a subset of accounts.</p>
<p>Communities are a pretty big departure for Twitter, which is obviously in the throes of reimagining the platform as a more dynamic place for community building. By carving out substantial space for subcommunities on Twitter, the company seems to be inching in the direction of a platform like Discord or Reddit, where everything revolves around self-moderating interest-based communities. Those platforms grapple with their own moderation headaches, but specific, interest-driven communities invite users to go deep in a way that makes interactions on Twitter look shallow by comparison.</p>
<p>The introduction of Communities is an interesting direction for a prominent social network that&#8217;s remained largely unchanged for more than a decade at this point. If the test sticks, Communities could build connective tissue between users and make the social network generally a more dynamic place to hang out — but that&#8217;s only possible if Twitter can strike the right balance between encouraging its newly imagined subcommunities to grow and keeping them safe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p3">The travel industry was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/coronavirus-pandemics-impact-on-travel-tourism-in-5-charts.html">one of the hardest hit by the pandemic</a>, and startup <a href="https://www.headout.com/">Headout</a> was no exception. A marketplace that let tourists make same-day bookings for tours, events and activities, the app expanded around the world after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/24/headout-raises-1-8-million-for-its-travel-app-that-puts-a-concierge-in-your-pocket/">launching in 2015. </a>Then COVID-19 hit.</p>
<p class="p3">But business is growing again thanks to rebounds in domestic travel and Headout claims it has grown 800% since January 2021. The company announced today it has raised $12 million led by Glade Brook Capital, which has also invested in marketplaces like Airbnb, Meituan, Uber and Instacart. The round included participation from returning investors Version One Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners, FJ Labs, 500 Startups, Haystack and Ludlow Ventures, and new investors Espresso Capital and Practical VC.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Headout says it reached profitable EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in July. The new funding will be used to expand into 300 cities, product development and its product, business, marketing and operations teams. Headout plans to hire more than 150 employees around the world and is also looking for opportunities to acqui-hire travel and entertainment startups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">This represents a massive turnaround from the beginning of the pandemic. In an email, co-founder and chief executive officer Varun Khona told TechCrunch, “the pandemic was devastating as you’d imagine. Our business went from doing $250 million+ to negligible scale in a matter of weeks.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Travel activities platform KKday raises $75 million Series C as it focuses on &#8216;staycations&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/travel-activities-platform-kkday-raises-75-million-series-c-as-it-focuses-on-staycations/embed/#?secret=SelFNwUHX9" data-secret="SelFNwUHX9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p3">But as travel gradually resumes, Headout identified “two massive tailwinds.” The first is an unprecedented demand for domestic travel. The second are travel experience providers who are digitizing for the first time. The company began focusing on domestic tourism in the last quarter of 2020. It’s seeing the highest demand in places with relatively high vaccination rates, like the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United Arab Emirates.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“To win this space, we prioritized onboarding new experiences that are more diverse, local and niche to attract domestic travelers. We standardized these mom-and-pop experience providers, upgraded their services and brought them online,” said Khona. “In conjunction, we worked hard on making Headout available in local languages — not just with machine translation but by actually ensuring we create content that is compelling and inspiring.” For example, 85% of bookings in Spain are sold in Spanish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">When asked how Headout differentiates from other on-demand booking marketplaces, Khona said in 2018 it evolved from a traditional listings oriented marketplace, like <a href="http://Booking.com"><span class="s1">Booking.com</span></a>, to a “more managed marketplace” by standardizing, upgrading and branding experiences to ensure consistent quality. This increased conversion rates, which in turn “helped us provide more sales to our partners and hence command a higher take rate,” leading to profitable unit economics.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a wildly unprecedented year and a half by any metric. The pandemic has utterly transformed many industries and made or broken others. In the world of technology, however, few categories were as well positioned to embrace a changed world than connected fitness.</p>
<p>The space was well on its way prior to the arrival of COVID-19, of course, and Peloton was largely seen as the tip of that spear. Founded in 2012, the company’s connected stationary bicycles have redefined the landscape for home workouts, through instructor-led live courses.</p>
<p>Demand for Peloton’s growing selection of fitness equipment saw a sharp spike as gyms all over the world shut down for indefinite periods, leaving many stuck at home to reimagine their workout experience.</p>
<p>But the period arrived with its share of challenges for Peloton’s executives. Increased demand saw the company battling supply chain issues, while in May, its treadmills were met with a pair of recalls over injury concerns.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=pelotonpost">September 21-23 at Disrupt</a>, Peloton CEO John Foley and Chief Content Office Jennifer Cotter will join us to discuss the company’s rise and successes and struggles amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Foley is the former CEO of Evite.com and Pronto.com, and former president of BarnesandNoble.com. He co-founded Peloton in June 2012 and has served as CEO since its inception. Cotter joined the company in 2019 to oversee Peloton’s streaming content. Her background in television programming includes stints at the Home Shopping Network and Oxygen Media.</p>
<p>Foley and Cotter join a growing list of great guests, including Canva CEO Melanie Perkins, investor Chamath Palihapitiya, Calendly CEO Tope Awotona and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=pelotonpost">Get your ticket </a>for less than $100 for a limited time!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.koyoloans.com">Koyo</a>, a fintech startup using open banking to offer loans to people with poor credit histories, has closed a Series A funding round of $50 million in debt and equity led by <a href="https://www.fomcap.com/">Force Over Mass</a>, with participation from existing investors Forward Partners, Frontline Ventures and Seedcamp. New investors in Koyo include Force Over Mass, Matt Robinson (founder of GoCardless, co-founder of Nested), and angel investors from the banking and lending sectors. It last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/koyo/">raised</a> $4.9 million in 2019. With many sectors of the population having racked up debts during the pandemic, Koyo is likely to benefit from this underclass of consumer, normally rejected by the main loans companies.</p>
<p>The startup says it uses Open Banking data (bank transactions), rather than credit agency scores to underwrite risk for lending to consumers. In other words, it looks at how customers spend their money on a day-to-day basis, rather than what a credit agency says about them. The idea is to offer attractive rates and cheaper borrowing to a usually underserved market, usually known as &#8220;thin file&#8221; customers (short or no credit history) or &#8220;near prime&#8221; customers. The near-prime market equates to 13-15 million people in the U.K.</p>
<p>Thomas Olszewski, Koyo’s founder and a former VC with Frontline Ventures in London and Cavalry Ventures in Berlin, said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Koyo launched at the start of the … pandemic and has proven that innovative use of open banking data results in better risk decisioning and ultimately has enabled us to grow the business during one of the toughest economic times the U.K. has faced. I’m proud to have continued to give many people in the U.K. access to competitively priced credit, during a time where most traditional lenders were quick to scale back their lending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Filip Coen, Force Over Mass partner, said, “We invest in companies that combine transformational technology with strong business models, and Koyo indexed strongly in both of those departments. Koyo has built a first-class foundation over the last 18 months of operation, and we’re excited to be part of its future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of Spotify playlist curators are <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Playlists-Solution-to-false-abusive-reporting/idi-p/4928676">complaining</a> that the streaming music company is not addressing the ongoing issue of playlist abuse, which sees bad actors reporting playlists that have gained a following in order to give their own playlists better visibility. Currently, playlists created by Spotify users can be reported in the app for a variety of reasons &#8212; like sexual, violent, dangerous, deceptive or hateful content, among other things. When a report is submitted, the playlist in question will have its metadata immediately removed, including its title, description and custom image. There is no internal review process that verifies the report is legitimate before the metadata is removed.</p>
<p>Bad actors have learned how to abuse this system to give themselves an advantage. If they see a rival playlist has more users than their own, they will report their competitors in hopes of giving their playlist a more prominent ranking in search results.</p>
<p>According to the curators affected by this problem, there is no limit to the number of reports these bad actors can submit, either. The curators complain that their playlists are being reported daily, and often multiple times per day.</p>
<p>The problem is not new. Users have been complaining about playlist abuse for years.<a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Playlists-Solution-to-false-abusive-reporting/idi-p/4928676#comments"> A thread on Spotify&#8217;s community forum</a> about this problem is now some 30 pages deep, in fact, and has accumulated over 330 votes. Victims of this type of harassment have also repeatedly posted to social media about Spotify&#8217;s broken system to raise awareness of the problem more publicly. For example, one curator last year noted their playlist had been reported over 2,000 times, and said they were getting a new email about the reports nearly every minute. <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Playlists-Solution-to-false-abusive-reporting/idc-p/5165705/highlight/true#M214866">That&#8217;s </a><a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Playlists-Solution-to-false-abusive-reporting/idc-p/5183109/highlight/true#M218149">a</a> <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Playlists-Solution-to-false-abusive-reporting/idc-p/5166040/highlight/true#M214895">common problem</a> and one that seems to indicate bad actors are leveraging bots to submit their reports.</p>

<p>Many curators say they&#8217;ve repeatedly reached out to Spotify for help with this issue and were given no assistance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Curators can only reply to the report emails from Spotify to appeal the takedown, but they don&#8217;t always receive a response. When they ask Spotify for help with this issue, the company only says that it&#8217;s working on a solution.</p>
<p>While Spotify may suspend the account that abused the system when a report is deemed false, the bad actors simply create new accounts to continue the abuse. Curators on Spotify&#8217;s community forums suggested that an easy fix to the bot-driven abuse would be to restrict accounts from being able to report playlists until their accounts had accumulated 10 hours of streaming music or podcasts. This could help to ensure they were a real person before they gained permission to report abuse.</p>
<p>One curator, who maintains hundreds of playlists, said the problem had gotten so bad that they created an iOS app to continually monitor their playlists for this sort of abuse and to reinstate any metadata once a takedown was detected. <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Playlists-Solution-to-false-abusive-reporting/idc-p/5185752/highlight/true#M218513">Another has written code to monitor for report emails</a> and uses the Spotify API to automatically fix their metadata after the false reports. But not all curators have the ability to build an app or script of their own to deal with this situation.</p>

<p>TechCrunch asked Spotify what it planned to do about this problem, but the company declined to provide specific details.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of practice, we will continue to disable accounts that we suspect are abusing our reporting tool. We are also actively working to enhance our processes to handle any suspected abusive reports,&#8221; a Spotify spokesperson told us.</p>
<p>The company said it is currently testing several different improvements to the process to curb the abuse, but would not say what those tests may include, or whether tests were internal or external. It could not provide any ballpark sense of when its reporting system would be updated with these fixes, either. When pressed, the company said it doesn&#8217;t share details about specific security measures publicly as a rule, as doing so could make abuse of its systems more effective.</p>
<p>Often, playlists are curated by independent artists and labels who are looking to promote themselves and get their music discovered, only to have their work taken down immediately, without any sort of review process that could sort legitimate reports from bot-driven abuse.</p>
<p>Curators complain that Spotify has been dismissing their cries for help for far too long, and Spotify&#8217;s vague and non-committal response about a coming solution only validates those complaints further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Private equity giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/thoma-bravo/">Thoma Bravo</a> has taken a stake in <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intel-471">Intel 471</a>, a provider of cyberthreat intelligence for enterprises and governments.</p>
<p>The strategic growth investment, which comes as organizations double down on cybersecurity amid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/what-you-need-to-know-about-covid-19-related-cyberattacks/">a pandemic-fueled rise in cyber threats</a>, will enable Intel 471 to evolve its product suite, broaden its go-to-market strategy and continue to &#8220;aggressively pursue innovation,&#8221; according to Thoma Bravo. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Intel 471, a Texas-based firm founded in 2014, takes a preventative approach to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity.</a> It leverages its access to forums and dark web marketplaces to equip organizations with intelligence and monitoring on threat actors and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/malware/">malware</a> attacks. Using the company&#8217;s platform, businesses can track threat actor activity and vulnerability exploits, analyze near-real-time monitoring of malware activity, trace threats that could cause security breaches and receive alerts on compromised credentials.</p>

<p>“As cybercriminals and their tactics become increasingly sophisticated, our monitoring and intelligence solutions have become mission-critical, with organizations of all sizes looking to us to help them protect against attacks,” said Mark Arena, CEO of Intel 471.</p>
<p>Arena, along with fellow co-founder Jason Passwaters, will continue to lead Intel 471 and will retain a &#8220;significant&#8221; ownership position</p>
<p>Thoma Bravo’s investment in Intel 471 sees the private equity firm continue its cybersecurity investing spending-spree. Its recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">$12.3 billion purchase of Proofpoint</a>, for example, said to be the largest acquisition in cybersecurity history, trumps Broadcom’s $10.7 billion purchase of Symantec, Intel’s $7.6 billion acquisition of McAfee and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/making-sense-of-the-6-5b-okta-auth0-deal/">Okta’s proposed $6.5 billion acquisition of Auth0</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Thoma Bravo also previously acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/thoma-bravo-completes-3-9b-sophos-acquisition/">Sophos for $3.9 billion</a>, took a majority stake in LogRhythm and paid <a href="https://www.imprivata.com/company/press/imprivata-agrees-be-acquired-thoma-bravo">$544 million for authentication startup Imprivata</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/sila-nanotechnologies-raises-590m-to-fund-battery-materials-factory/">Sila Nanotechnologies&#8217;</a></span> <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">next-generation battery technology made its commercial product debut Wednesday in the new Whoop fitness tracker, a milestone that caps a decade of research and development by the Silicon Valley startup, all aimed at cracking the code to packing more energy into a cell at a lower cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billions have been spent over the past few years on improving battery chemistry, with different startups aiming to either replace the anode or the cathode with a conversion material, like silicon or even lithium in the case of solid state companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sila Nano’s battery chemistry recipe replaces graphite in a battery cell’s anode with silicon to create a more energy-dense and cheaper battery pack. Other companies, like BASF, are focusing on creating a high energy dense cathode. </span></p>

<p>While numerous companies are working on a variety of different battery chemistries, they have yet to take over the traditional cell technology found in today&#8217;s lithium-ion cells. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Sila battery used in the upcoming Whoop 4.0, the company&#8217;s latest health and performance tracker, could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be the first time in the last few decades the world has seen a next-generation battery chemistry ship to market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Launching a small fitness tracker doesn’t seem like a big thing, but this is really the first device in the market that proves our breakthrough, and, over time, this will scale and lead to the electrification of everything,” Gene Berdichevsky, founder and CEO of Sila Nano, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicles, and Sila Nano&#8217;s role in powering them, is at the top of Berdichevsky&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;electrification of everything&#8221; list. And the company has already made headway.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sila Nano has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/"> joint battery ventures</a> with BMW and Daimler to produce batteries containing the company’s silicon-anode technology, with the goal of going to market in the automotive industry by 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can translate this success with Whoop to cars in many ways,” said Berdichevksy. “Today, if you want a really long-range vehicle, it better be a pretty big car. The smaller the EV, the shorter the range because there’s nowhere to put the battery. But as our technology advances into the automotive market, you’ll be able to have a city car that has 400 miles of range on it. This is enabling more segments of the auto industry to electrify.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoop, which </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/whoop-raises-another-200m-for-its-athlete-focused-fitness-wearable/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this month announced a $200 million raise at a $3.6 billion valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is introducing the Whoop 4.0 as a wearable that’s 33% smaller, in large part as a result of Sila’s battery, which has about 17% higher energy density, according to Berdichevsky. Not only does a denser, better battery lead to a smaller wearable, but Whoop was able to add additional features &#8212; like a sleep coach with haptic alerts, a pulse oximeter, a skin temperature sensor and a health monitor &#8212; without compromising its five-day battery life. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Whoop raises another $200M for its athlete-focused fitness wearable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/whoop-raises-another-200m-for-its-athlete-focused-fitness-wearable/embed/#?secret=9zu53kcNm0" data-secret="9zu53kcNm0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the key outcomes of enabling a chemistry like ours is it allows you to build things that couldn&#8217;t otherwise be built,” said Berdichevsky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Whoop’s case, that’s referring to its new Any-Wear tech that allows the wearable to be integrated into a new line of garments like bands that can collect sensor data from areas including the torso, waist and calf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just Sila’s chemistry that’s allowing for a successful product to go to market. It’s the scalability of the product that’s really important. Scalability has been built into Sila’s roadmap from the beginning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things we did very early on is we told our scientists and engineers they could only use global commodity inputs so that we know we can make enough for millions of cars,” said Berdichevsky. &#8220;Next we said you had to use only what we call &#8216;bulk manufacturing&#8217; techniques, and that means you use volumetric reactors rather than planar reactors.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>An easy way to think about the difference in reactor types is through the analogy of making enough food to feed a crowd: A big pot of chili (the volumetric reactor) will go a lot further than individual pizza pies (planar reactors).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berdichevsky also told his team that anything they created had to be able to seamlessly drop into any battery factory process, whether that factory is supplying batteries for smartphones, cars or drones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sila Nano has already proven scalability twice, Berdichevsky said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The first time it scaled 100x from lab to pilot, starting with volumetric reactors that were about the size of a liter. Wednesday&#8217;s partnership with Whoop marks the second time the company has scaled up 100x, and this time to 5,000 liter reactors. To put that in relative terms, a couple of humans could probably climb into one of those reactors. The next stage of scaling will involve reactors large enough that you could drive a car through, says Berdichevsky, which is fitting, given Sila Nano’s goal of scaling up to automotive quantities over the next three years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason we’re not in cars today is we have to go scale up 100x to have enough to really deploy in cars, but the material is the same,” said Berdichevsky. “The particles, the powder we make, it’s the same in every one of the scales we’ve made so far.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies try to navigate an ever-changing security landscape, it can be challenging to protect everything. Security startup <a href="https://truefort.com/">TrueFort </a>has built a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/">zero trust solution</a> focusing on protecting enterprise applications. Today, the company announced a $30 million Series B.</p>
<p>Shasta Ventures led today&#8217;s round with participation from new firms Canaan and Ericsson Ventures along with existing investors Evolution Equity Partners, Lytical Ventures and Emerald Development Managers. Under the terms of the agreement Nitin Chopra, managing director at Shasta Ventures, will be joining the company board. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised to almost $48 million.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Sameer Malhotra says that TrueFort protects customers by analyzing at each application and figuring out what normal behavior looks like. Once it understands that, it will flag anything that falls outside of the norm. The company achieves this by gathering data from partners like CrowdStrike and from multiple points within the application and infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we get this telemetry, whether it&#8217;s networks, endpoints, servers or third-party partners, we then help the customer build a picture of what those applications are doing and what&#8217;s normal behavior. We then help them baseline that, and monitor that in real time with response and real-time controls to continue those applications through their normal life cycle,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zero trust is a concept where as a matter of policy you assume that you cannot trust any individual or device until the entity proves it belongs on your systems. Malhotra says that customers are becoming more comfortable with the concept and in 2020 the company saw massive 650% YoY revenue growth, with it up 120% YoY this year so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing the demand, especially as zero trust is becoming a more familiar vernacular amongst the security community [&#8230;]. Again, it&#8217;s having the visibility and understanding, and then being able to then reduce it to the limited number of acceptable relationships or executions,&#8221; he said. And he believes that it all comes down to understanding your applications and how they operate.</p>

<p>The company currently has 60 employees, with hopes of reaching 85 or 90 by the end of the year. Malhotra says that as they build the employee base, they are driving to make it diverse at every level.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look at diversity across our whole management team, all the way from the board down to our different levels. We are quite aggressive in hiring diverse candidates, whether they&#8217;re women or LGBTQ or people of color. And we have focused programs where we work with different universities [&#8230;] to bring on new employees from a diverse talent pool. We also work with different recruiters from that perspective, and our focus is always to look at a different palette and to make sure that we&#8217;re as diverse an organization as we can,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2015 by Malhotra and his partner Nazario Parsacala, both of whom spent more than 20 years working at big financial services companies &#8212; Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. They worked for a couple of years building the program, launching the first beta in 2017 before bringing the first generally available product to market the following year.</p>
<p>Currently customers can install the solution on prem or in the cloud of their choice, but the company has a SaaS solution in the works as well, that will be ready in the next couple of months.</p>

Chinese EV maker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xpeng-p7-ev-183226796.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">Xpeng</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpM_zX0Fe7U" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">teased</a> a robot unicorn meant for children to ride. As <em>SCMP</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3147903/xpengs-unveils-smart-robot-pony-children-taking-it-step-closer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">notes</a>, the quadruped will take advantage of Xpeng&#8217;s experiences with autonomous driving and other AI tasks to navigate multiple terrain types, recognize objects and provide &#8220;emotional interaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is shy on most other details, although the design looks and trots like a cuter, more kid-friendly version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spot-boston-dynamics-commercial-sales-140018961.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">Boston Robotics&#8217; Spot</a>. It&#8217;s appropriately about as tall as a child. Sorry, folks, you won&#8217;t prance your way to work.</p>
<p>This robot unicorn is just about as mythical as the &#8216;real&#8217; thing, too. Xpeng hasn&#8217;t revealed when it expects to deliver its robotic horse-with-a-horn, let alone pricing or availability. It might not cost as much as a $75,000 Spot, but we&#8217;d expect something this sophisticated to cost more than the $2,900 Aibo from 2019.</p>
<p>To some extent, profit is beside the point. Xpeng chief He Xiaopeng said the unicorn was part of a broader move into the robotics space by taking advantage of the company&#8217;s existing technology. Think of this as a first step. What Xpeng learns from its unicorn could lead to more sophisticated (and hopefully adult-oriented) robots you&#8217;re more likely to buy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. government is preparing to spend over half a million dollars to encourage the development of detection technologies for child sexual exploitation material (CSAM) that can be bolted on to end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms to scan for the illegal material, as part of its ongoing policy push around internet and child safety.</p>
<p>In a joint initiative today, the Home Office and the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) <a href="https://homeofficemedia.blog.gov.uk/2021/09/08/new-safety-tech-fund-challenge/">announced</a> a &#8220;Tech Safety Challenge Fund&#8221; &#8212; which will distribute up to £425,000 (~$584,000) to five organizations (£85,000/$117,000 each) to develop &#8220;innovative technology to keep children safe in environments such as online messaging platforms with end-to-end encryption&#8221;.</p>
<p>A Challenge statement for applicants to the program adds that the focus is on solutions that can be deployed within E2E-encrypted environments &#8220;without compromising user privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem that we&#8217;re trying to fix is essentially the blindfolding of law enforcement agencies,&#8221; a Home Office spokeswoman told us, arguing that if tech platforms go ahead with their &#8220;full end-to-end encryption plans, as they currently are&#8230; we will be completely hindered in being able to protect our children online&#8221;.</p>
<p>While the announcement does not name any specific platforms of concern, Home Secretary Priti Patel has previously attacked Facebook&#8217;s plans to expand its use of E2E encryption &#8212; warning in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56795852">April</a> that the move could jeopardize law enforcement&#8217;s ability to investigate child abuse crime.</p>
<p>Facebook-owned WhatsApp also already uses E2E encryption so that platform is already a clear target for whatever &#8220;safety&#8221; technologies might result from this taxpayer-funded challenge.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s iMessage and FaceTime are among other existing mainstream messaging tools which use E2E encryption.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So there is potential for very widespread application of any &#8220;child safety tech&#8221; developed through this government-backed challenge. (Per the Home Office, technologies submitted to the Challenge will be evaluated by &#8220;independent academic experts&#8221;. The department was unable to provide details of who exactly will assess the projects.)</p>
<p>Patel, meanwhile, is continuing to apply high-level pressure on the tech sector on this issue &#8212; including aiming to drum up support from G7 counterparts.</p>
<p>Writing in a paywalled op-ed in a Tory-friendly newspaper, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/09/08/priti-patel-call-worlds-tech-giants-please-dont-put-profit-safety/">The Telegraph</a>, she trails a meeting she&#8217;ll be chairing today where she says she&#8217;ll push the G7 to collectively pressure social media companies to do more to address &#8220;harmful content on their platforms&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The introduction of end-to-end encryption must not open the door to even greater levels of child sexual abuse. Hyperbolic accusations from some quarters that this is really about governments wanting to snoop and spy on innocent citizens are simply untrue. It is about keeping the most vulnerable among us safe and preventing truly evil crimes,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am calling on our international partners to back the UK’s approach of holding technology companies to account. They must not let harmful content continue to be posted on their platforms or neglect public safety when designing their products. We believe there are alternative solutions, and I know our law enforcement colleagues agree with us.&#8221;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I am leading discussions with my G7 counterparts on how to keep our children safe online. </p>
<p>I’m calling on them to back the UK’s approach of asking social media companies to put safety before profits.</p>

<p>&mdash; Priti Patel (@pritipatel) <a href="https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1435547373174939650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the op-ed, the Home Secretary singles out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">Apple&#8217;s recent move to add a CSAM detection tool</a> to iOS and macOS to scan content on user&#8217;s devices before it&#8217;s uploaded to iCloud &#8212; welcoming the development as a &#8220;first step&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple state their child sexual abuse filtering technology has a false positive rate of 1 in a trillion, meaning the privacy of legitimate users is protected whilst those building huge collections of extreme child sexual abuse material are caught out. They need to see th[r]ough that project,&#8221; she writes, urging Apple to press ahead with the (currently delayed) rollout.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/">Last week</a> the iPhone maker said it would delay implementing the CSAM detection system &#8212; following a backlash led by security experts and privacy advocates who raised concerns about vulnerabilities in its approach, as well as the contradiction of a &#8220;privacy-focused&#8221; company carrying out on-device scanning of customer data. They also flagged the wider risk of the scanning infrastructure being seized upon by governments and states that might order Apple to scan for other types of content, not just CSAM.</p>
<p>Patel&#8217;s description of Apple&#8217;s move as just a &#8220;first step&#8221; is unlikely to do anything to assuage concerns that once such scanning infrastructure is baked into E2E encrypted systems it will become a target for governments to widen the scope of what commercial platforms must legally scan for.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Md2NzTCtRQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">Apple&#8217;s CSAM detection tech is under fire — again</a></p></blockquote>

<p>However the Home Office&#8217;s spokeswoman told us that Patel&#8217;s comments on Apple&#8217;s CSAM tech were only intended to welcome its decision to take action in the area of child safety &#8212; rather than being an endorsement of any specific technology or approach. (And Patel does also write: &#8220;But that is just one solution, by one company. Greater investment is essential.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The Home Office spokeswoman wouldn&#8217;t comment on which types of technologies the government is aiming to support via the Challenge fund, either, saying only that they&#8217;re looking for a range of solutions.</p>
<p>She told us the overarching goal is to support <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8221;middleground&#8221; solutions &#8212; denying the government is trying to encourage technologists to come up with ways to backdoor E2E encryption.</span></p>
<p>In recent years in the U.K. GCHQ has also floated the controversial idea of a so-called &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/apple-google-microsoft-whatsapp-sign-open-letter-condemning-gchq-proposal-to-listen-in-on-encrypted-chats/">ghost protocol</a>&#8221; &#8212; that would allow for state intelligence or law enforcement agencies to be invisibly CC’d by service providers into encrypted communications on a targeted basis. That proposal was met with widespread criticism, including from the tech industry, which warned it would undermine trust and security and threaten fundamental rights.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if the government has such an approach &#8212; albeit with a CSAM focus &#8212; in mind here now as it tries to encourage the development of &#8220;middleground&#8221; technologies that are able to scan E2E-encrypted content for specifically illegal stuff.</p>
<p>In another concerning development, earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">this summer</a>, guidance put out by DCMS for messaging platforms recommended that they &#8220;prevent&#8221; the use of E2E encryption for child accounts altogether.</p>
<p>Asked about that, the Home Office spokeswoman told us the tech fund is &#8220;not too different&#8221; and &#8220;is trying to find the solution in between&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working together and bringing academics and NGOs into the field so that we can find a solution that works for both what social media companies want to achieve and also make sure that we&#8217;re able to protect children,&#8221; she said, adding: &#8220;We need everybody to come together and look at what they can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is not much more clarity in the Home Office <a href="https://view.publitas.com/public-1/safety-tech-challenge-fund-supplier-guidance/page/2-3">guidance</a> to suppliers applying for the chance to bag a tranche of funding.</p>
<p>There it writes that proposals must &#8220;make innovative use of technology to enable more effective detection and/or prevention of sexually explicit images or videos of children&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within scope are tools which can identify, block or report either new or previously known child sexual abuse material, based on AI, hash-based detection or other techniques,&#8221; it goes on, further noting that proposals need to address &#8220;the specific challenges posed by e2ee environments, considering the opportunities to respond at different levels of the technical stack (including client-side and server-side).&#8221;</p>
<p>General information about the Challenge &#8212; which is open to applicants based anywhere, not just in the U.K. &#8212; can be found on the Safety Tech Network <a href="https://www.safetytechnetwork.org.uk/innovation-challenges/safety-tech-challenge-fund">website</a>.</p>
<p>The deadline for applications is October 6.</p>
<p>Selected applicants will have five months, between November 2021 and March 2022 to deliver their projects.</p>
<p>When exactly any of the tech might be pushed at the commercial sector isn&#8217;t clear &#8212; but the government may be hoping that by keeping up the pressure on the tech sector platform giants will develop this stuff themselves, as Apple has been.</p>
<p>The Challenge is just the latest U.K. government initiative to bring platforms in line with its policy priorities &#8212; back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/30/uk-wants-tech-firms-to-build-tools-to-block-terrorist-content/">2017</a>, for example, it was pushing them to build tools to block terrorist content &#8212; and you could argue it&#8217;s a form of progress that ministers are not simply calling for E2E encryption to be outlawed, as they frequently have in the past.</p>
<p>That said, talk of &#8220;preventing&#8221; the use of E2E encryption &#8212; or even fuzzy suggestions of &#8220;in between&#8221; solutions &#8212; may not end up being so very different.</p>
<p>What is different is the sustained focus on child safety as the political cudgel to make platforms comply. That seems to be getting results.</p>
<p>Wider government plans to regulate platforms &#8212; set out in a draft Online Safety bill, published earlier this year &#8212; have yet to go through parliamentary scrutiny. But in one already baked in change, the country&#8217;s data protection watchdog is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">now enforcing a children&#8217;s design code</a> which stipulates that platforms need to prioritize kids&#8217; privacy by default, among other recommended standards.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oyyvCKNqoL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">UK now expects compliance with children&#8217;s privacy design code</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK now expects compliance with children&#8217;s privacy design code&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/embed/#?secret=oyyvCKNqoL" data-secret="oyyvCKNqoL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Age Appropriate Design Code was appended to the U.K.&#8217;s data protection bill as an amendment &#8212; meaning it sits under wider legislation that transposed Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) into law, which brought in supersized penalties for violations like data breaches. And in recent months a number of social media giants have announced changes to how they handle children&#8217;s accounts and data &#8212; which the ICO has credited to the code.</p>
<p>So the government may be feeling confident that it has finally found a blueprint for bringing tech giants to heel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter announced yesterday that it&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1435323978734841857">testing a feature</a> on the web that makes it possible to remove followers without blocking them. Sometimes, users want to stop a follower from seeing their tweets without outright blocking them &#8212; if that follower were to navigate directly to their page, it&#8217;d be clear that they had been blocked, which can pose safety risks. Now, some Twitter users with access to this test can remove a follower by navigating to their profile and clicking to view their list of followers. Then, they can click on a three-dot icon next to the follow button and select &#8220;remove this follower&#8221; from the drop-down menu. Not all users currently have this functionality.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re making it easier to be the curator of your own followers list. Now testing on web: remove a follower without blocking them.</p>
<p>To remove a follower, go to your profile and click “Followers”, then click the three dot icon and select “Remove this follower”. <a href="https://t.co/2Ig7Mp8Tnx">pic.twitter.com/2Ig7Mp8Tnx</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Previously, users had maneuvered this &#8220;soft block&#8221; themselves &#8212; if you block a user, then unblock them, it removes them from your followers list. The current test only allows you to remove followers from your own follower list, so if you&#8217;re a particularly popular tweeter, it could be difficult to scroll through thousands of names to find the one person you&#8217;re looking for. But according to app researcher Alessandro Paluzzi, Twitter has also been working on the ability to remove a follower from their profile, not just your own followers list.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Twitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Twitter</a> is working on an option to remove followers directly from their profile <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/g9Q1ve3qS1">pic.twitter.com/g9Q1ve3qS1</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The platform is showing a continued investment in user experience updates focused on web safety. Last week, it revealed a suite of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/twitter-plans-new-privacy-features-to-get-more-people-tweeting">privacy tools</a> that it&#8217;s working on, which included the ability to remove followers. The platform also proposed the potential to archive tweets after 30, 60 or 90 days, hiding liked tweets, and leaving conversations. While third-party programs like <a href="https://semiphemeral.com/">Semiphemeral</a> have long made it possible to automatically delete old tweets and unlike messages, having these features built into the app itself could make it easier for users to have greater control over their digital presence without sharing their data with outside developers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gig and independent workers have different needs than salaried employees when it comes to financial products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a challenge that Tilak Joshi, founder of </span><a href="http://www.withlean.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, became acutely aware of during his tenure as head of Mint and years as a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">product exec at American Express and PayPal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the U.S. has seen a major shift in more independent workers in recent years, traditional financial institutions have “failed to keep up,” in his view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seventy percent of independent workers live paycheck to paycheck and 30% are inadequately insured,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Independent workers will soon become the majority of the U.S. workforce, and the existing conversation, platforms and institutions need to rapidly evolve to support them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon leaving Mint in 2020, Joshi teamed up with Eden Kfir and Ramki Venkatachalam to start Lean in an effort to support gig workers with a platform that offers access to financial products that he says are “custom built” for their needs. And today, the startup is announcing it has raised $4.5 million in a seed round led by Inspired Capital that included participation from Atelier Ventures, Oceans Ventures and Acequia Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, a slew of marketplace industry operators also put money in the round, including DoorDash exec Gokul Rajaram; Instacart co-founder Max Mullen; Manik Gupta, ex-CPO Uber; Vivek Patel, ex-COO of Postmates; Bird CPO Ryan Fujiu; and others. The latest financing brings Lean’s total raised to nearly $6 million to date. Other high-profile angels who have backed the company include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Charlie Songhurst, Lightspeed Venture Partners (and former Stripe exec) partner Justin Overdorff, Coinbase’s Marc Bhargava, and executives from ANGI Homeservices, Coinbase and Plaid.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Independent workers see some of the most restrictive financial scenarios of anywhere in the U.S.,” Joshi told TechCrunch. “What workers do to patch up their financial problems is work across various gig marketplaces and when marketplaces try to keep them and pay them incentives, they just figure out how to game the system. It just turns into inefficiency on both sides where marketplaces don&#8217;t really have the stability of having a strong workforce they can rely on and workers are also just in a tight spot.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2199197" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199197" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199197 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="667" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=150,147 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=300,294 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=768,754 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=680,667 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lean-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lean</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean aims to help independent workers by partnering directly with marketplaces to offer financial products and benefits. The goal is to help marketplaces with worker acquisition and retention by giving gig workers access to “no-cost capital, instant payouts and financial products such as mortgages, “low-to-no-cost borrowing,” HSAs and insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean works with marketplaces of all sizes that employ either 1099 or W2 workers that work in industries such as ride-hailing, courier, healthcare and construction. Joshi said that in addition to boosting worker acquisition and retention, Lean has the potential to &#8220;unlock&#8221; revenue for marketplaces via financial products and infrastructure rather than through fees to workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its platform, Joshi said, is designed to be integrated with any marketplace in less than two weeks. Through its marketplace partnerships, Lean expects to be rolling out to “hundreds of thousands” of gig workers across the country over the coming months, according to Joshi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no cost for marketplaces and no cost for workers. Lean expects to earn revenue through the fees associated with the movement of money via its platform, Joshi said. So far, the startup has inked deals with half a dozen marketplaces, and has another half a dozen in the works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to expand its offering and continue to scale across marketplaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Batsiyan, partner at Inspired Capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says he was attracted to Lean because of the team, market timing and approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are huge market tailwinds to better serving gig workers, and marketplaces are increasingly searching for better ways to attract and retain their workers,” he wrote via email. “Also, Tilak [Joshi] came to a similar conclusion to us at Inspired: that marketplaces would not build these solutions themselves. They need an intermediary &#8212; like Lean &#8212; to make financial benefits a turnkey solution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batsiyan also believes that Lean’s B2B2C approach is unique. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a platform, Lean can then leverage its partnerships to achieve much more efficient distribution to the end workers,” he said. </span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mint&#8217;s first product manager <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/monarch-raises-4-8m/">raised $4.8 million in seed funding</a> for <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch</a>, a subscription-based platform that aims to help consumers “plan and manage” their financial lives.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (popularizing the modern internet). He didn’t protect the technology because he wanted it to benefit us all. Three decades later, most of the power &#8212; and a lot of the profits &#8212; of the internet are in the hands of a few tech billionaires, and much of the early promise of the internet remains unfulfilled.</p>
<p>To avoid the same fate for space, we need to subsidize new players to create competition and lower costs, as well as regulate space travel to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Space matters. It could create countless jobs and fuel economies, and may even hold the solution to climate change. Investors can already see this, having poured billions into space companies in an industry with a potential market value of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/why-the-space-industry-may-triple-to-1point4-trillion-by-2030.html">$1.4 trillion</a> by 2030.</p>
<p>Space may seem too vast to be dominated by a few tech billionaires, but in 1989, so did the internet. We need to get this right, because from the mechanics and aerospace engineers to the marketing, information and logistics workers, the space industry could fuel global job creation and economic growth.</p>
<p>For that to happen, we need competition. What we have now is a few players operating perhaps for their founders’ benefits, not the world’s.</p>
<p>We should not repeat the mistakes we made with the internet and wait for the technology to be abused before we step in. For example, in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a private technology company used weapons-grade social media manipulation to pursue their own profit (which is their obligation to their shareholders) but to society’s harm (which it is regulators’ job to protect).</p>
<p>In space, the stakes are even higher. They also affect all of humanity, not a few countries. There are environmental dangers (we are probing the carbon cost of “Earth” flights, but not space flights), and an accident, as well as leading to loss of life in space, could send fatal debris to Earth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These dangers are not unforeseen. Virgin Galactic had its <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29857182">first fatality</a> in 2014. A Space X launch puts out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/19/billionaires-space-tourism-environment-emissions">as much carbon dioxide</a> as flying around 300 people across the Atlantic. Earlier this year, some unguided space debris from a Chinese rocket <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/science/china-rocket-reentry-falling-long-march-5b.html">landed</a> in the Maldives.</p>
<p>We should not wait until these accidents happen again &#8212; perhaps at a bigger scale &#8212; before we act.</p>
<p>Space tourism can and should be about much more than giving the 1% another Instagrammable moment and increasing the wealth of the billionaires who provide the service.</p>
<p>The space industry should be managed in a way that delivers the most good to the largest number of people. That starts with subsidies.</p>
<p>In short, we should treat space travel like any other form of transit. Making that sustainable economically will almost inevitably require some government intervention.</p>
<p>We have been here before: When the combination of air travel, highways and rising labor costs led the two largest railways in the United States to bankruptcy, the Nixon administration intervened and created Amtrak.</p>
<p>This wasn’t ideologically fueled (quite the opposite). This was a decision to make sure the U.S. reaped the economic benefits of interstate travel. Even though Amtrak remains unprofitable 50 years after its creation, it is a crucial piece of economic infrastructure upon which many other industries &#8212; as well as millions of individuals and families &#8212; rely.</p>
<p>We need to do the same with space travel. Very few individuals will benefit from what will be an uber-luxury segment of the travel market, with Virgin Galactic tickets predicted to cost $250,000 (and that is the entry-level space travel product; Virgin’s competitors are priced at multiples of that cost).</p>
<p>If we subsidize the industry now, while ensuring there are new competitors in space, we can ensure it hits a critical mass where all the broader benefits of space travel become a reality.</p>
<p>This will be much easier than waiting for monopolies to emerge and then trying to fight them (which is what the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is trying to do, decades too late, to Big Tech).</p>
<p>Space travel is not just hype or the plaything of billionaires. It is the final frontier, both physically and economically.</p>
<p>If we want it to be a success, we should learn from our successes and failures back on Earth and apply them to space now.</p>
<p>That means subsidies, support, regulation and safety. These things are important on Earth, but in space they are absolutely essential.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> is on a well-deserved vacation this week, so for the Equity Wednesday deep dive, we took the conversation to Twitter Spaces. <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/metrickmind">Jonathan Metrick</a>, the chief growth officer at Portage Ventures, dove into growth marketing. You can listen to the full episode on the Equity Podcast feed.</p>
<p>This conversation was spurred by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">TechCrunch Experts project</a>, where we&#8217;re looking for the best growth marketers for startups. Metrick was recommended to us in July (you can read his featured recommendation in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/growth-marketing-roundup-techcrunch-experts-creative-testing-and-how-to-nail-your-narrative/">growth roundup</a>) and we were eager to learn from his experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this conversation, we cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Influencers taking on the marketing world.</li>
<li>The challenges marketers face with iOS 14.</li>
<li>How Metrick sees trends developing geographically.</li>
<li>What holiday advertising might look like in 2021.</li>
