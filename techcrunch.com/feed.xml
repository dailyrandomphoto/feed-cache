					<description><![CDATA[Virtual events have been a temporary measure during the pandemic. But what will their value be as more of the world attempts to return to life before the pandemic?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few people thought of virtual events before the pandemic struck, but this format has fulfilled a unique and important need for companies and organizations large and small during the pandemic. But what will virtual events&#8217; value be as more of the world attempts to return to life before COVID-19?</p>
<p>To find out, we caught up with top executives and investors in the sector to learn about the big trends they’re seeing — as the sequel to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-remote-events/">this survey we did in March 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Certain use cases have been proven, they say. Today, you can find numerous small niche events available year-round that might have been buried in the back of a larger in-person conference before 2020. For organizations, internal virtual events can also be instrumental in helping connect and promote engagement for remote-first teams.</p>
<p>However, some respondents acknowledged that low-quality virtual events are growing ever more common, and everyone agreed that there is much more work to be done.</p>
<p><strong>We surveyed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaoyinqu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiaoyin Qu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founder and CEO, </span><a href="https://www.runtheworld.today/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run The World</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosieroca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosie Roca</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, chief customer officer, </span><a href="https://hopin.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemantmohapatra/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemant Mohapatra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, partner, </span><a href="https://lsvp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightspeed Venture Partners India</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulbz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Murphy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former investor in Hopin with </span><a href="https://northzone.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northzone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (currently co-founder of </span><a href="https://gokatch.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katch</span></a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Xiaoyin Qu, founder and CEO, Run The World</h2>
<p><strong>With the pandemic hopefully becoming more manageable soon, do you feel a return to in-person events is inevitable?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Certain types of events will go back to in person. Obviously, something to do with a President&#8217;s Club — the company rewards you with a party in Hawaii — that kind of thing will not go virtual. I think events more focused on increasing reach will continue to trend toward virtual.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Hybrid is just another buzzword to say that both online and offline events formats will coexist. Of course they will.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We’re also seeing that many events are getting smaller, more niche. Before the pandemic, if we look at a general pediatric conference, for example, an attendee may only be interested in two topics out of the 200 offered. But now we’ve seen that there&#8217;s a rise in many niche events that focus on very specific topics, which helps streamline these events for attendees.</p>
<p>I think such events are still going to happen virtually just because they&#8217;re easier to organize and people can have more in-depth conversations. Internal virtual events for employees is another category that is getting more traction, because companies have been going remote. So many the internal events like the company happy hour — events that help employees engage better — we think that&#8217;s still going to happen virtually. So there are a number of use cases we think will continue to be virtual and are probably better virtual.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>What sort of trends do you think will emerge once in-person events are possible again?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Another important trend we&#8217;re seeing is that a lot of organizers have begun hosting events more frequently. They were doing large conferences in the past, but now they&#8217;re pivoting or they&#8217;re rethinking their strategy. They realize that hosting maybe 10 events a year is better than hosting one big event every year. A traditional conference is usually multiday, with maybe 200 different topics and 100 different speakers. Now a lot of people are thinking about spreading it out throughout the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new video from Agility Robotics showcases an increasing familiar sight: advanced, autonomous robots performing boring warehouse tasks. It’s not the sort of video that tends to be hugely viral for a company, rather, it’s the sort of meat and potatoes proof of concept that companies like Boston Dynamics wedge between flashy videos of parkour and highly choreographed dance sessions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, this is precisely the sort of tasks the robots’ creators are targeting: the well-known trio of dull, dirty and dangerous. Moving payloads back and forth certainly ticks that first box pretty well. There’s a reason warehouse and fulfillment workers often liken their work to robotics.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jycdks836bY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>“The conversation around automation has shifted a bit,” Agility CEO Damion Shelton tells TechCrunch. “It’s viewed as an enabling technology to allow you to keep the workforce that you have. There are a lot of conversations around the risks of automation and job loss, but the job loss is actually occurring now, in advance of the automated solutions.”</p>
<p>Digit, the bipedal robot the company announced back in 2020, had its most high-profile moment in the spotlight after Agility announced a partnership with auto giant Ford back at CES. The auto giant currently owns two of the robots, with long-term plans to utilize the technology for delivery.</p>
<p>Today’s video is an attempt to showcase some more short-term solutions, putting Digit to work on more menial tasks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197116" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197116" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2197116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Made-for-Work.2021-09-01-13_51_18-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Agility Robotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The value and goal of a machine like Digit is the generality,” CTO Jonathan Hurst says. “It’s a robot that can operate in human environments and spaces. It’s a relatively straightforward thing for very structured, repetitive tasks, to say, &#8216;there’s going to be boxes over there. We’re going to tell you which one from a databasing system, and we want you to move it over there.&#8217; Maybe this is something that it does for three or four hours a day and then it goes to a different space and does it three or four hours and then it unloads a tractor trailer.”</p>
<p>The company sees Digit’s value as a more plug and play solution than something like Berkshire Gray’s offerings, which builds a fully automated warehouse from the ground up. There’s still programming involved, of course. An Agility rep will appear on-site to pre-map a location and help the robot execute its repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>“In terms of where we can actually deploy and do useful work for a customer, it turns out a lot of the tasks &#8212; walk from Point A to Point B, pick up and carry a package &#8212; are portable across these environments,” says Shelton. &#8220;There’s no real core piece of technology that you develop, that’s different for an indoor environment versus outdoor. It’s just the level of maturity. I think we’ve reached that pretty quickly on the indoor stuff, so it’s a logical first place for deployment.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197117" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197117" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2197117" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Made-for-Work.2021-09-01-13_48_22.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197117" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Agility Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Agility hasn’t announced partners beyond Ford, though it says it’s currently working with “major logistics companies.” It hasn’t revealed numbers of Digits sold, either, though it tells TechCrunch that the number is “substantially more” than the dozen Cassie units it sold prior to Digit, largely for research purposes. Sales are largely CapEx at the moment, though the company is exploring other opportunities, such as a RaaS (robotics-as-a-service model).</p>
<p>Agility’s team is currently at 56 people, primarily based in Oregon (the company got its start as part of OSU’s nascent robotics division), where the robots are primarily manufactured.</p>
<p>“We’ve grown pretty rapidly since last December,” says Shelton. “We’re expanding our Pittsburgh office by the end of the year, in addition to the Oregon office. We have a pretty rapid growth rate. As we’ve been increasing the production rate on the robots, we’ve had a fair amount of hiring for that. We just moved into a new facility that we remodeled, back in June.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After opening <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">applications</a> in June, Twitter is rolling out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">Super Follows</a>, its premium subscription option, starting today.</p>
<p>The feature, first revealed in February, will allow users to subscribe to accounts they like for a monthly subscription fee in exchange for exclusive content. For creators, Super Follows are another useful tool in the emerging patchwork of monetization options across social platforms.</p>
<p>Eligible accounts can set the price for Super Follow subscriptions, with the option of charging $2.99, $4.99 or $9.99 per month, prices fairly comparable to a paid newsletter. They can then choose to mark some tweets for subscribers only, while continuing to reach their unpaid follower base in regular tweets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2197076" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?w=680" alt="Twitter Super Follows" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png 3788w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/super-follow-example.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Paid subscribers will be marked with a special Super Follower badge, differentiating them from unpaid followers in the sea of tweets. The badge shows up in replies, elevating a follower&#8217;s ability to interact directly with accounts they opt to support. For accounts that have Super Follows turned on, the option will show up with a distinct button on the profile page.</p>
<p>Super Follows aren&#8217;t turned on for everyone. For now, the process remains application only, with a waitlist. The option lives in the Monetization options in the app&#8217;s sidebar, though users will need to be U.S.-based with 10K followers and at least 25 tweets within the last month to be eligible.</p>
<p>U.S. and Canada-based iOS Twitter users will be able to Super Follow some accounts starting today, with more users globally seeing the rollout in the coming weeks. On the creator side, Super Follows are only enabled in iOS for now, though support for Android and desktop are &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter&#8217;s &#8216;Super Follow&#8217; creator subscription takes shots at Substack and Patreon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/embed/#?secret=tI0a228V2l" data-secret="tI0a228V2l" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Twitter says that Super Follow income will be subject to the standard, though controversial, 30 percent in-app purchase fees collected by Apple or Google. Twitter will only take a 3 percent cut of earnings for up to the first $50,000 generated through Super Follows — a boon for smaller accounts getting off the ground or anyone who uses the paid Twitter feature as a way to supplement other creator income elsewhere. After an account hits the $50,000 earnings mark, Twitter will begin taking a 20 percent cut.</p>
<p>Super Follows aren&#8217;t Twitter&#8217;s first monetization experiment to make it out in the wild. In May, Twitter introduced Tip Jar, a way for accounts to receive one-time payments through integration with the Cash App and other payment platforms. The test is limited to a subset of eligible accounts including &#8220;creators, journalists, experts, and nonprofits&#8221; for the time being.</p>

<p>Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/twitter-starts-to-roll-out-paid-ticketed-spaces-on-ios/">Twitter rolled out Ticketed Spaces</a> for users who applied for the paid audio room feature back in June. Twitter&#8217;s cut from Ticketed Spaces mirrors the same fee structure it uses for Super Follows and users will be able to charge anywhere from one dollar to $999 for advanced ticketing.</p>
<p>The product is the latest in a flurry of activity from the social platform after a lengthy period of product stagnation. But Twitter has been busy in the last twelve months, from releasing and killing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">ill-fated Fleets</a> to finally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-safety-mode-harassment/">showing signs of life</a> on the kind of anti-abuse features many people have been calling for for years.</p>
<p>Giving users the ability to charge for premium content is a pretty major departure for Twitter, which mostly stayed the course until activist shareholders <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-ouster-ceo-elliott-management-paul-singer-2020-2">threatened to oust CEO Jack Dorsey</a>. It&#8217;s also a major move for the company into the white-hot creator space, as more platforms add tools to empower their users to make a living through content creation — ideally keeping them loyal and generating revenue in the process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.berlin-brands-group.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> &#8212; one of the new wave of e-commerce startups hoping to build lucrative economies of scale around buying up smaller brands that sell on marketplaces like Amazon and using technology to run and scale them more efficiently &#8212; has picked up a big round of funding to fill out that mission. The startup has closed a round of $700 million, comprising both equity and debt, which it will use in part to continue building its fulfillment and logistics infrastructure, as well as its tech platform, and in part to buy more companies.</p>
<p>BBG confirmed that the investment &#8212; one of the biggest to date in the space &#8212; boosts its valuation to over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Bain Capital is leading the equity portion of this round. The deal will also see it buy out a previous investor, Ardian, for an undisclosed amount that is separate to the $700 million raise.</p>
<p>This funding round is the second announced by BBG this year. In January it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced it would be investing $302 million</a> off its own balance sheet for M&amp;A, and in April it announced a debt round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of $240 million</a>. This latest $700 million is different in that it includes the equity component alongside the equity.</p>
<p>BBG got its start initially developing its own products and selling them on Amazon and other marketplaces &#8212; founder and CEO CEO Peter Chaljawski was a DJ in a previous life and started with a focus on audio equipment he developed for himself.</p>
<p>Over time, it saw an opportunity to diversify that into a wider consolidation play, where BBG would also acquire and merge third party brands into its business, tapping into the opportunity to provide the owners of the third-party businesses an exit route and bring those smaller brands more scale, more marketing nous, and more tech to improve the efficiency of their operations.</p>
<p>Today the mix totals 3,700 products and 14 own brands, including Klarstein (kitchen appliances), auna (home electronics and music equipment), Capital Sports (home fitness) and blumfeldt (garden). BBG says it has access to some 1.5 billion e-commerce customers across various marketplaces where it sells goods in Europe, the UK, the U.S. and Asia. Notablym unlike many others in the same space as BBG, it is focused on more than Amazon, with some 100 channels in 28 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That list of &#8220;many others in the same space&#8221; is a long one and seemingly growing by the day. Yesterday, two of them &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/uk-based-heroes-raises-200m-to-buy-up-more-amazon-merchants-for-its-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/olsam-raises-165m-to-buy-up-and-scale-consumer-and-b2b-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olsam</a> &#8212; respectively raised $200 million and $165 million. Others leveraging the opportunity of consolidating merchants that sell via Fulfillment by Amazon include  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/suma-brands-raises-150m-to-acquire-more-third-party-brands-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suma Brands</a> ($150 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elevate-brands-banks-250m-to-roll-up-third-party-merchants-selling-on-amazons-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate Brands</a> ($250 million); <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a> ($775 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factory14</a> ($200 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a> (currently probably the biggest of them all in terms of reach and money raised and ambitions), <a href="https://heyday.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Razor Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>, Latin America’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainforest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una Brands</a> out of Asia. \</p>
<p>As more startups enter the fray, all battling to buy the best of the third-party brands will become more of a challenge, and so the backing of Bain should help BBG shore up against that competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Bain Capital&#8217;s commitment and the additional funding secured, we have set our next milestone on our path to building a global house of brands,&#8221; said Chaljawski in a statement. &#8220;This allows us to tackle strategic goals of acquiring and developing brands globally, as well as the operational and logistical expansion. Bain Capital&#8217;s experience working with founders worldwide will help us continue our evolution as a leading e-commerce company in scaling brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;BBG is a disruptive leader in the rapidly changing consumer goods space. Their ability to develop and scale brands that meet current consumer trends through their highly efficient e-commerce platform gives the company tremendous growth potential in a fast-growing market,&#8221; added Miray Topay, MD at Bain Capital Private Equity. &#8220;We have partnered with many founder-led management teams and look forward to helping Peter and his team achieve their goal of becoming a global leader in consumer e-commerce&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the United States, a 401(k) plan is an employer-sponsored defined-contribution pension account. However, with legacy institutional investing, most of these have at least some level of fossil fuel involvement and let’s face it, very few of us really know. Now a startup plans to change that.</p>
<p>California-based startup <a href="http://oursphere.org">Sphere</a> wants to get employees to ask their employers for investment options that are not invested in fossil fuels. To do that it’s offering financial products that make it easier &#8211; it says &#8211; for employers to offer fossil-free investment options in their 401(k) plans. This could be quite a big movement. Sphere says there are over $35 trillion in assets in retirement savings in the US as of Q1 2021.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a $2M funding round led by climatetech-focused VC Pale Blue Dot led the investment round. Also participating were climate-focused investors including Sundeep Ahuja of Climate Capital. Sphere is also a registered ‘Public Benefit Corporation’ allowing it to campaign in public about climate change.</p>
<p>Alex Wright-Gladstein, CEO and founder of Sphere said: “We are proud to be partnering with Pale Blue Dot on our mission to reverse climate change by making our money talk. Heidi, Hampus, and Joel have the experience and drive to help us make big changes on the short 7 year time scale that we have to limit warming to 1.5°C.” Wright-Gladstein has also teamed up with sustainable investing veteran Jason Britton of Reflection Asset Management and BITA custom indexes.</p>
<p>Wright-Gladstein said she learned the difficulty of offering fossil-free options in 401(k) plans when running her previous startup, Ayar Labs. She tried to offer a fossil-free option for employees, but found out it took would take three years to get a single fossil-free option in the plan.</p>
<p>Heidi Lindvall, General Partner at Pale Blue Dot said: “We are big believers in Sphere&#8217;s unique approach of raising awareness through a social movement while offering a range of low-cost products that address the structural issues in fossil-free 401(k) investing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last month, Twitch users have become increasingly concerned and frustrated with bot-driven hate raids. To protest Twitch&#8217;s lack of immediate action to prevent targeted harassment of marginalized creators, some streamers are going dark to observe #ADayOffTwitch today.</p>
<p>Per the protest, users are sharing a <a href="https://twitter.com/LuciaEverblack/status/1432749839641632775">list of demands</a> for the Amazon-owned Twitch. They want the platform to host a roundtable with creators affected by hate raids, allow streamers to approve or deny incoming raids, enable tools to only allow accounts of a certain age to chat, remove the ability to attach more than three accounts to one email address, and share a timeframe for when comprehensive anti-harassment tools will be implemented.</p>

<p>&mdash; Meg Turney (@megturney) <a href="https://twitter.com/megturney/status/1432876805678116864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>TechCrunch asked Twitch if it has plans to address these demands. Twitch responded with a statement: &#8220;We support our streamers’ rights to express themselves and bring attention to important issues across our service. No one should have to experience malicious and hateful attacks based on who they are or what they stand for, and we are working hard on improved channel-level ban evasion detection and additional account improvements to help make Twitch a safer place for creators.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twitch </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/20/twitch-unveils-a-suite-of-new-tools-to-help-creators-grow-their-channels-and-make-money/">Raids</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> are a part of the streaming platform&#8217;s culture &#8212; after one creator ends their stream, they can &#8220;raid&#8221; another stream by sending their viewers over to check out someone else&#8217;s channel. This feature is supposed to help more seasoned streamers support up-and-comers, but instead, it&#8217;s been weaponized as a tool for harassment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In May, Twitch launched 350 new tags related to gender, sexual orientation, race and ability, which users </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310210-discover/suggestions/37011022-trans-tag-request">requested</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> so that they could more easily find creators that represent them. But at the same time, these tags made it easier for bad actors to harass marginalized streamers, and Twitch hasn&#8217;t yet added tools for streamers to deal with increased harassment. In the meantime, Twitch users have had to take matters into their own hands and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools">build their own safety tools</a> to protect themselves while Twitch works on its updates. Twitch hasn&#8217;t shared when its promised anti-harassment tools will go live.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As recently as December, Twitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/">updated its policies</a> on hateful content and harassment, which the platform said have always been prohibited, yet vicious attacks have continued. After facing targeted, racist hate raids on their streams, a Black Twitch creator <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rekitraven">RekItRaven</a> started the #TwitchDoBetter hashtag on Twitter in early August, calling out Twitch for its failure to prevent this abuse. While Twitch is aware of the issue and said it&#8217;s working on solutions, <a href="https://www.change.org/p/amazon-twitch-do-better-stop-hate-raids-against-people-of-color-and-marginalized-creators?recruiter=60679039&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;utm_term=share_petition&amp;recruited_by_id=cdf10ce0-f224-0130-2417-0022190c02ea">many users</a> find Twitch&#8217;s response to be too slow and lacking.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve been building channel-level ban evasion detection and account improvements to combat this malicious behavior for months. However, as we work on solutions, bad actors work in parallel to find ways around them—which is why we can&#39;t always share details.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Along with streamers LuciaEverblack and ShineyPen, RekItRaven organized #ADayOffTwitch to put pressure on Twitch to make its platform safer for marginalized creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate on the platform is not new,&#8221; Raven told <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/black-content-creators-organize-one_day-boycott-against-twitch">WYNC&#8217;s The Takeaway</a>. But bot-driven raid attacks are more difficult to combat than individual trolls. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had people come in with bots. It&#8217;s usually one or two people who program a bunch of bots, you bypass security measures that are put in place and just spam a broadcaster&#8217;s chat with very inflammatory, derogatory language.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Raven said they have since had a discussion with Twitch, they don&#8217;t feel that one conversation is enough.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Turns out a bunch of LGBTQUIA2+, BIPOC, Disabled, Neurodivergent, and Plural creators really can make a difference by showing up, being loud, and not backing down despite people telling us we won&#39;t accomplish anything.

<p>&mdash; Lucia Everblack (@LuciaEverblack) <a href="https://twitter.com/LuciaEverblack/status/1430711114761965573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>As part of #ADayOffTwitch, some streamers are encouraging their followers to support them financially on other platforms through the #SubOffTwitch tag. Twitch takes 50% of streamers&#8217; revenue, so creators are promoting their accounts on platforms like Patreon and Ko-Fi, which take a much smaller cut. Though competitor YouTube Gaming takes 30% of revenue, and Facebook Gaming <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/facebook-no-creator-revenue-split-2023-zuckerberg-1234990191/">won&#8217;t take a cut from creators</a> until 2023, Twitch remains dominant in the streaming space. According to Streamlabs and Stream Hatchet, Twitch <a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492">represented 72.3%</a> of the market share in terms of viewership Q1 2021.</p>
<p>Still, popular creators like Ben Lupo (DrLupo), Jack Dunlop (CouRage), and Rachell Hofstetter (Valkyrae) have recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal">left Twitch</a> for exclusive deals with YouTube Gaming. If Twitch remains unsafe for marginalized creators, others might be swayed to follow their lead, exclusive deals or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A recent move to Auckland, New Zealand — a city with lackluster public transit and hills that can turn a quick bike ride to the store into a sweaty workout — piqued my interest in e-bikes.</p>
<p>Strong demand and skyrocketing prices, however, made it difficult to access these coveted e-bikes here in Aotearoa, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa">Land of the Long White Cloud</a>. That changed after learning about Ubco, the New Zealand-based electric utility bike startup that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/electric-utility-bike-startup-ubco-raises-10-million-to-fund-its-global-expansion/">raised $10 million</a> from investors.</p>
<p>The company provided me with the Ubco 2X2 Adventure Bike for nearly a month, which gave me plenty of time to put it to the test.</p>
<p>I may not be Ubco’s target audience, although I did my best to use the bike as its design suggests, and packed it up with bags of books and other heavy things that might simulate the weight of delivered garlic bread, mail and other packages. The Ubco 2X2 Adventure Bike is made for city utility riding, with the option of going off-road, which I would later try with gusto.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s flagship is the Ubco 2X2 Work Bike, an electric dirt bike that was originally designed to help farmers. The fresh capital the company raised in June will be used to expand into existing verticals like food delivery, postal service and last-mile logistics, scale a commercial subscription business and target sales growth in the United States.</p>
<p>Domino’s drivers in Auckland, and I hear in the U.K., can be seen delivering hot pizzas on Ubco bikes, and the company has a range of other national clients, like the New Zealand Post, the Defense Force, the Department of Conservation, and Pāmu, or Landcorp Farming Limited, as well as other local restaurants and stores.</p>

<h2>The handoff</h2>
<p>CEO and co-founder Timothy Allan drove out from the company headquarters in Tauranga to hand off the bike personally. It was a sunny day in my neighborhood, and I listened impatiently as he described the various bits and bobs, how to work the machine and how to charge it.</p>
<p>Allan helped me download the Ubco app to pair my phone with the bike, which, among other functionalities, allowed me to select beginner mode, which would cap the vehicle speed at around 20 miles per hour. I made a mental note so that I could write about it here, but was determined to reach the top speed of 30 miles per hour right away.</p>
<p>I did, and it was … pretty sick. I’m not supposed to gush, but man! It’s a sweet ride. Here’s why:</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>The Adventure Bike comes standard in white and sits on 17&#215;2.75-inch multiuse tires with aluminum rims, both of which are DOT compliant. My version also had Maori decals on the frame, in a nod to the indigenous people of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The bike’s height is about 41 inches and the seat comes to 32 inches. From wheel to wheel, it’s about 72 inches. The payload, including the rider, is about 330 pounds, so both my partner (6’2” man) and I (5’7” female) rode this bike with ease, needing only to adjust the wide rearview mirrors sticking out of the handlebars. And no, we didn’t ride it together. This bike is designed as a one-seater.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187584" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187584" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187584 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187584" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rebecca Bellan</p></div></p>
<p>That said, there’s a little cargo rack above the back wheel, which holds the license plate (apparently these are classified as mopeds, which require registration in many places) and any other cargo one might carry. I didn’t try, but I reckon it could hold at least five pizza boxes tied down with a bungee cord. The bike rack also allows for saddlebags to be strapped on. Ubco sells what it calls the Pannier Back Pack, a weather-resistant roll-top cargo bag, for $189 that slots in very nicely and is actually a quality bag with 5.28-gallon capacity.</p>
<p>Accessories aside, the alloy frame is lightweight and step-through, which I love in a bike &#8212; it lets me start to shift myself off before I fully park and I feel super agile and swift. Speaking of parking, the rules are different everywhere, I assume, but here, you park it on the street or in parking spaces, not on the sidewalk. It’s got a kickstand to hold it in place, and you can lock the front wheel so no one can just wheel it away. They <i>could,</i> however, probably chuck it into the back of their pickup truck if they so chose, since it’s only 145 pounds.</p>
<p>The appearance of the bike stood out, and not just to me. During my multiweek test drive, numerous tradesmen and bike folks went out of their way to compliment its design, the exact demographic that Ubco is aiming for.</p>
<h2>Rideability</h2>
<p>The lightness of the bike means that it’s easy to take off and find your balance. The battery is also in the middle of the frame, just near where your feet sit, which anchors the bike and gives you a stable center of gravity.</p>
<p>The lightweight nature of the bike is a blessing and a curse. Cutting a turn is easy, but on a windy day and an open road, there were moments I worried that I’d be knocked off it &#8212; but maybe that had more to do with riding next to a 10-wheeler on the street. Because it’s so light, it did feel a bit strange to me to be in the street lane with the other bigger, meaner cars rather than in the bike lanes.</p>
<p>The bike accelerates quickly via the fully electronic throttle control, even up steep hills, due to the high torque geared drivetrain. The drivetrain has two 1 kw Flux2 motors with sealed bearings, active heat management and active venting for residual moisture &#8212; a necessity in this moistest of cities.</p>
<p>The acceleration sound, which mimics those of a gas-powered dirt bike but with a softer electronic tone, was a surprising plus. I didn’t realize how much I relied on my sense of sound to tell how fast I was going until I rode the Ubco.</p>
<p>The braking system was a bit touchy. It felt very sensitive to me, probably because hydraulic and regenerative brakes are operating together on the vehicle. There’s also a passive regenerative braking system, which I gather is what put the brakes on for me when I was just trying to coast down one of those mammoth hills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187588" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187588" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187588 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6043.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187588" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rebecca Bellan</p></div></p>
<p>Both the front suspension, 130 mm, and rear suspension, 120 mm, have a coil spring with a hydraulic dampener and have preload and rebound adjustment. In other words, the shocks are awesome. Even when I actively drove myself off sidewalks and over speed bumps, I could barely feel a thing.</p>
<p>To test its off-road capabilities, I took the bike to Cornwall Park, where I ran it at full speed on the grass, swerving between trees, flying over roots and rocks, doing doughnuts in the field. It was good fun and I felt completely in control of the vehicle. I can imagine why farmers have turned to the Work Bike.</p>
<p>When it was time to test out its use as a delivery bike, I packed the two saddlebags with books and groceries and took it for a spin. Still a great ride, although I was a little wobbly turning corners until I got the hang of it.</p>
<h2>Value</h2>
<p>Since the Ubco Adventure Bike doesn’t neatly fit into a specific bike category, it’s not a simple price comparison. An electric moped, like a Lexmoto Yadea or a Vespa Elettrica, could set you back anywhere from $2,400 or $7,000, respectively. Electric dirt bikes could cost anywhere from $6,000 to $11,000 for something like a KTM or Alta Motors. That said, Swedish electric motorbike startup Cake did just come out with its latest made specifically for city riding, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/electric-motorbike-company-cake-launches-the-makka-an-e-moped-for-city-riding-at-3500/"> Makka, at $3,500</a>. It looks a lot like the Ubco, but it&#8217;s a bit smaller.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the Ubco Adventure Bike costs $6,999 with a 2.1 kW power supply and $7,499 for a 3.1 kW power supply. Depending on what you want it for, I&#8217;d say it’s somewhere around mid-range for a bike like this. Since you&#8217;d probably use it for work-related activities, it could get a tax write-off. Plus, you want quality in a bike that’s down to do some heavy lifting, and Ubco has plenty of that. It’s not only a handy utility bike, but it’s also got some excellent tech under the proverbial hood, which we’ll get to later.</p>
<p>Ubco estimates a 10- to 15-year life expectancy, depending on use. Over-the-air software updates, replacing parts and full refurbishments can help keep the bike going for longer. The company encourages riders to send back the dead bikes because it&#8217;s committed to full product stewardship.</p>
<p>That said, if you wanted to buy a bike now, it’d be a preorder (unless your local Ubco dealer had some in stock). Ordering now could get you an Ubco by September if you live in the States. The company says it’s still feeling the effects of COVID, with high demand and a stretched supply chain causing delays. The preorder requires a $1,000 deposit.</p>
<p>Ubco also has a subscription model, which is mainly available for enterprise customers at the moment and priced on a case-by-case basis. However, it&#8217;s piloting subscriptions for individuals in Auckland and Tauranga before rolling the program out globally. Subscriptions will start at around NZD $300 per month for a 36-month term.</p>
<h2>Range</h2>
<p>The Adventure Bike comes with either the 2.1 kWh battery pack, which has around 40 to 54 miles of range, or the 3.1 kWh, with 60 to 80 miles.</p>
<p>The battery is run off a management system, called &#8220;Scotty,&#8221; to monitor real-time performance and safety. The battery, which is sealed with alloy and vented during use, is made with 18650 lithium-ion cells, which means it’s a powerful battery that can handle up to 500 charging cycles. Ubco says its batteries are designed to be disassembled at the end of life.</p>

<p>The 10 amp alloy fast charger can fuel the battery fully within four to six hours. You can charge it while it’s still in the vehicle by just connecting it to a power outlet, or you can unlock the battery and yank it out (it’s a little heavy) and charge it inside. Note: Charging is loud. Not sure if this is standard, but probably is.</p>
<p>I charged it every two to three days, but that will depend on use and where you are. It’s winter in Auckland, so a bit cold, which affects battery life, and the hills are brutal, which also use up a lot of battery life.</p>
<p>I’d ride it downtown and around my neighborhood every day, but I’d wager a delivery driver would need to charge it nightly. As I mentioned earlier, the battery can be removed for charging, so if you take it to work, you can always take it up to the office or wherever to charge while you’re doing other things.</p>
<h2>Tech features</h2>
<h3>Vehicle management system</h3>
<p>The vehicle runs off what Ubco calls its Cerebro vehicle management system, which integrates all electronic and electrical functions of the vehicles and provides control and updates via Bluetooth. Ubco builds with end of life in mind, so the CAN bus is isolated so future CAN devices can be easily integrated.</p>
<p>Now, one of my first questions, given the heftiness of this bike and the likelihood of gig economy workers who would ride it for work living in urban dwellings, was this: How can I ensure no one will steal this thing when it’s on the street, because there’s no way I’m lugging it up to my fifth-floor walkup?</p>
<p>Like I said, you can lock the wheel in place, which would make it far more difficult for someone to wheel it off. If someone did decide to capture the whole cumbersome vehicle, Ubco would be able to track it for you. Each Ubco bike has telemetry, aka a SIM card, hardwired inside, and that can help provide data that can be used for location, servicing, theft, safety, route planning, etc.</p>
<p>This VMS architecture is made for handling fleets via Ubco’s enterprise subscription vehicles, but it obviously has other uses, like providing peace of mind (personally, I’d still lock it up with chains, but I’m a New Yorker and trust no one). Obviously, if you think this telemetry is creepy, you can opt out, but it does come standard with subscriptions, allowing subscribers to track their bike&#8217;s location on the app.</p>

<p>Mounted on the handlebar is an LCD display that shows speed, power levels and more. Also on the handlebars are switch controls for high or low beams, indicators and a horn. I found the indicators to be a bit sticky and sometimes I would slip and hit the horn. What I <i>wish</i> the handlebars also had was a mount for your phone so you could follow directions. I had my headphones in and was listening to Google Maps tell me how to get around, but that felt less safe and efficient.</p>
<h3>Turning it on</h3>
<p>You can turn the power on with a keyless fob by either clicking the button on the fob or the button on the handlebars. I will note that the keyless fob button is weirdly sensitive. At multiple points, I had it in my pocket with my phone or other pocket inhabitants and it must have knocked into the button, turning the vehicle off while I was riding it. Thankfully, that never happened anywhere busy, but that’s something to be wary about.</p>
<h3>App</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, you could pair your phone, as well as other users&#8217; phones, to the bike using the app. The app allows you to choose learner mode or restricted mode, which controls ride settings; turn the bike and lights on and off; change the metrics; and check the status of things like battery life, speed and motor temperature. It&#8217;s basically all the info on the dash, but on an app. I didn&#8217;t really feel the need to use it.</p>
<h3>Lights</h3>
<p>The LED headlights are on at all times when the vehicle is turned on, but there&#8217;s also a high and low beam, as well as peripheral parking lights, all of which are designed for disassembly at the end of life. There are also LED rear, brake and number plate lights, as well as DOT-approved indicator lights.</p>
<h2>Other stuff</h2>
<p>Among the features that don’t fit neatly into the other categories, there’s the field kit, which is fastened to the lift-up seat and contains a user manual and tools to set up and maintain the 2X2, which is really handy. Usually, when people buy an Ubco bike, it comes in a box and there are “a few simple steps to follow to get it ready to ride.” There’s also an <a href="https://www.ubcouniversity.com/courses/how-to-set-up-your-new-2x2-2021-wrk-adv-bikes">UBCO University</a> course that shows how to set it up. If you buy from one of Ubco’s dealers, they’ll unpack it and set it up when you come to collect it.</p>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>Maintenance comes with the cost of a monthly subscription. Ubco has a network of technicians placed wherever the company sells its bikes if they&#8217;re in need of fixing. If there&#8217;s no authorized mechanic nearby, Ubco&#8217;s head office will work with customers to help them fix the bike. Ubco did not respond to information about how many authorized mechanics are in its network.</p>
<p>Again, being from New York, I&#8217;ve seen probably thousands of delivery riders on bikes and mopeds, oven mitts covered in a plastic bag taped onto the handlebars so drivers can keep their hands warm during the colder months. This bike can handle a hefty load for delivering goods, it&#8217;s quick and agile for weaving in and out of traffic, and it&#8217;s easy to ride and use.</p>
<p>The subscription offering, especially for enterprise, makes this a great city utility bike that can probably handle a range of weather conditions. I already know it can handle rain and mud, so all signs point to success in the sloshy, icy hell of a Northern city winter. And for the adventurer &#8212; the person who just wants to ride something sweet on- and off-road, out of the city and into the wilderness &#8212; this is also a great consumer ride that will last you quite a while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sec/">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> has fined several brokerage firms a total of $750,000 for exposing the sensitive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/personally-identifiable-information/">personally identifiable information</a> of thousands of customers and clients after hackers took over employee email accounts.</p>
<p>A total of eight entities belonging to three companies have been sanctioned by the SEC, including Cetera (Advisor Networks, Investment Services, Financial Specialists, Advisors, and Investment Advisers), Cambridge Investment Research (Investment Research and Investment Research Advisors), and KMS Financial Services.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-169">a press release</a>, the SEC announced that it had sanctioned the firms for failures in their cybersecurity policies and procedures that allowed hackers to gain unauthorized access to cloud-based email accounts, exposing the personal information of thousands of customers and clients at each firm</p>
<p>In the case of Cetera, the SEC said that cloud-based email accounts of more than 60 employees were infiltrated by unauthorized third parties for more than three years, exposing at least 4,388 clients&#8217; personal information.</p>
<p>The order states that none of the accounts featured the protections required by Cetera’s policies, and the SEC also charged two of the Cetera entities with sending breach notifications to clients containing “misleading language suggesting that the notifications were issued much sooner than they actually were after discovery of the incidents.”</p>
<p>The SEC’s order against Cambridge concludes that the personal information exposure of at least 2,177 Cambridge customers and clients was the result of lax <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> practices at the firm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Although Cambridge discovered the first email account takeover in January 2018, it failed to adopt and implement firm-wide enhanced security measures for cloud-based email accounts of its representatives until 2021, resulting in the exposure and potential exposure of additional customer and client records and information,” the SEC said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The order against KMS is similar; the SEC&#8217;s order states that the data of almost 5,000 customers and clients were exposed as a result of the company’s failure to adopt written policies and procedures requiring additional firm-wide security measures until May 2020.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Investment advisers and broker-dealers must fulfill their obligations concerning the protection of customer information,&#8221; said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&#8217;s Cyber Unit. &#8220;It is not enough to write a policy requiring enhanced security measures if those requirements are not implemented or are only partially implemented, especially in the face of known attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the parties agreed to resolve the charges and to not commit future violations of the charged provisions, without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. As part of the settlements, Cetera will pay a penalty of $300,000, while Cambridge and KMS will pay fines of $250,000 and $200,000 respectively. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Cambridge told TechCrunch that it does not comment on regulatory matters, but said it has and does maintain a comprehensive information security group and procedures to ensure clients&#8217; accounts are fully protected. Cetera and KMS have yet to respond.</p>
<p>This latest action by the SEC comes just weeks after the Commission ordered London-based publishing and education giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/pearson-to-pay-1m-fine-for-misleading-investors-about-2018-data-breach/">Pearson to pay a $1 million fine for misleading investors about a 2018 data breach</a> at the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.forumbrands.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forum Brands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an e-commerce acquisition platform, announced today that it has secured $100 million in debt funding from </span><a href="https://www.triplepointcapital.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TriplePoint Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing comes just just over two months after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the startup raised $27 million in an equity funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brenton Howland, Ruben Amar and Alex Kopco founded New York-based Forum Brands in the summer of 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re buying what we think are A+ high-growth e-commerce businesses that sell predominantly on Amazon and are looking to build a portfolio of standalone businesses that are category leaders, on and off Amazon,” Howland told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “A source of inspiration for us is that we saw how consumer goods and services changed fundamentally for what we think is going to be for decades and decades to come, accelerating the shift toward digital.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we covered the company in June, Forum Brands says it has acquired several new brands, including </span><a href="https://bonzapet.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a seller of pet products, and</span><a href="https://simkarose.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Simka Rose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a baby-focused brand specializing in eco-friendly products. Simka sells in the U.S. and the EU and is an example of how Forum is expanding globally, Amar said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howland and Amar emphasize that the Forum team continues to focus on quality over quantity when evaluating potential acquisitions. Although they meet with 15-20 founders a week, they are selective in which companies they choose to acquire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We continue to be a quality-first buyer, and not quantity-driven,” Amar said, noting that the company will still help a company build its brand even if it does not yet meet Forum’s quality threshold or if the founders are just not yet ready to sell.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new funds will be used to, naturally, acquire more e-commerce companies. As part of the debt financing, Sajal Srivastava, co-CEO and co-founder of TriplePoint Capital, will be joining Forum’s board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are impressed not only by Forum’s long-term strategy and ability to leverage technology and deep collective e-commerce and M&amp;A experience but also by how Forum cultivates relationships with their sellers both before and after partnering with them,” he said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its June raise, Forum had about 20 employees. As of today, it has about 40.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forum’s technology employs “advanced” algorithms and over 100 million data points to populate brand information into a central platform in real time, instantly scoring brands and generating accurate financial metrics.</span></p>
<p>On August 31, we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/olsam-raises-165m-to-buy-up-and-scale-consumer-and-b2b-amazon-marketplace-sellers/">the news</a> that on the heels of Heroes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/uk-based-heroes-raises-200m-to-buy-up-more-amazon-merchants-for-its-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> a $200 million raise to double down on buying and scaling third-party Amazon Marketplace sellers, <em>another</em> startup out of London aiming to do the same announced some significant funding of its own. <a href="https://olsamgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olsam</a>, a roll-up play that is buying up both consumer and B2B merchants selling on Amazon by way of Amazon’s <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBA fulfillment program</a>, closed on $165 million — a combination of equity and debt that it will be using to fuel its M&amp;A strategy, as well as continue building out its tech platform and to hire more talent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is launching a new version of its <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/">Chrome Beta browser</a> today that&#8217;s introducing some fairly notable changes to its user interface and design. The browser will introduce an updated New Tab page, which will now include cards directing you back to past web search activities, instead of only a list of shortcuts to favorite websites. Other changes aim to make it easier to navigate search results and to highlight and share quotes from the web.</p>
<p>The New Tab page&#8217;s update will be one of the first changes Chrome beta users may notice.</p>
<p>The idea behind this design change is about getting you back quickly to past web activities without a need dive into your browsing history to remember which sites you had been using for things like recipes or shopping. It can also help you to return quickly to your recent documents list in Google Drive, in a handy bit of cross-promotion for Google services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196948" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196948" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196948" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png 2250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=1536,929 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=2048,1239 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196948" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The page will now feature what Google is calling &#8220;cards,&#8221; not just links, which could direct you to things like a recently-visited recipe site where you had been browsing for ideas, a Google doc you need to finish editing, or a retailer&#8217;s website where you had left your shopping cart filled with things you may like to purchase at a later date. The latter ties into Google&#8217;s larger investment in online shopping, which has already seen the search giant trying to grab more marketshare in the space by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/">making product listings free</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">partnering with e-commerce platforms like Shopify.</a></p>
<p>Google is rightly concerned about Amazon&#8217;s surging advertising business, which is a large part of the retailer&#8217;s &#8220;Other&#8221; category that grew <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazons-advertising-business-surging-amid-industry-wide-ad-sales-boom-tech-giants/">87% year-over-year</a> to generate $7.9 billion in the second quarter. Now, it&#8217;s capitalizing on Chrome&#8217;s New Tab real estate to elevate shopping activity in the hopes of pushing users to complete their transactions.</p>
<p>Another change aims to make it easier to do web research. Google says that often, users searching for something on its platform will navigate to multiple web pages to find their answer. The new version of Chrome will experiment with a different way of connecting users to their search results by adding a row beneath the address bar on Chrome for Android that will show the rest of the results so you can navigate to other web pages without needing to hit the back button.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2196952" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196952" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Webnotes_Mobile.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196952" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>A new &#8220;quote cards&#8221; experiment, also coming to Chrome Beta on Android, will allow users to create a stylized image for social sharing that features text found on websites. Taking a screengrab of a website&#8217;s text is something that&#8217;s already a common activity, and particularly for people who want to share a key point from a news article they&#8217;re reading with followers on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. With this new feature, you&#8217;ll be able to long press text to highlight it, then tap Share and select a template by tapping on the &#8220;Create Card&#8221; option from the menu.</p>
<p>All features are a part of the Chrome Beta browser. To enable experiments, you can type <em>chrome://flags</em> into the browser&#8217;s address bar or click on the Experiments beaker icon, and then enable the flags. The associated flags for these experiments are #ntp-modules flag (New Tab page), #continuous-search (search results changes), and #webnotes-stylize flag (quote cards).</p>
<p>Experiments don&#8217;t necessarily become Chrome features that roll out more broadly. Instead, they offer Google a way to capture large-scale user feedback about its new design ideas, so the features can be tweaked and fine-tuned before a public release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s newest test could provide some long-awaited relief for anyone facing harassment on the platform.</p>
<p>The new product test introduces a feature called &#8220;Safety Mode&#8221; that puts up a temporary line of defense between an account and the waves of toxic invective that Twitter is notorious for. The mode can be enabled from the settings menu, which toggles on an algorithmic screening process that filters out potential abuse that lasts for seven days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of Tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks,&#8221; Twitter Product Lead Jarrod Doherty said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2196998" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Safe Mode won&#8217;t be rolling out broadly — not yet, anyway. The new feature will first be available to what Twitter describes as a &#8220;small feedback group&#8221; of about 1,000 English language users.</p>
<p>In deciding what to screen out, Twitter&#8217;s algorithmic approach assesses a tweet&#8217;s content — hateful language, repetitive, unreciprocated mentions — as well as the relationship between an account and the accounts replying. The company notes that accounts you follow or regularly exchange tweets with won&#8217;t be subject to the blocking features in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>For anyone in the test group, Safety Mode can be toggled on in the privacy and safety options. Once enabled, an account will stay in the mode for the next seven days. After the seven day period expires, it can be activated again.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In crafting the new feature, Twitter says it spoke with experts in mental health, online safety and human rights. The partners Twitter consulted with were able to contribute to the initial test group by nominating accounts that might benefit from the feature, and the company hopes to focus on female journalists and marginalized communities in its test of the new product. Twitter says that it will start reaching out to accounts that meet the criteria of the test group — namely accounts that often find themselves on the receiving end of some of the platform&#8217;s worst impulses.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Twitter announced that it was working on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/"> developing new anti-abuse features</a>, including an option to let users &#8220;unmention&#8221; themselves from tagged threads and a way for users to prevent serial harassers from mentioning them moving forward. The company also hinted at a feature like Safety Mode that could give users a way to defuse situations during periods of escalating abuse.</p>
<p>Being &#8220;harassed off of Twitter&#8221; is, unfortunately, not that uncommon. When hate and abuse get bad enough, people tend to abandon Twitter altogether, taking extended breaks or leaving outright. That&#8217;s obviously not great for the company either, and while it&#8217;s been slow to offer real solutions to harassment, it&#8217;s obviously aware of the problem and working toward some possible solutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Goodcall’s free cloud-based conversational platform leverages artificial intelligence to manage incoming business phone calls and boost customer service while assisting to other patrons.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even without staffing shortages, local merchants have difficulty answering calls while all hands are busy, and <a href="https://goodcall.com">Goodcall</a> wants to alleviate some of that burden from America’s 30 million small businesses.</p>
<p>Goodcall’s free cloud-based conversational platform leverages artificial intelligence to manage incoming phone calls and boost customer service for businesses of all sizes. Former Google executive Bob Summers left Google back in January, where he was working on Area 120 — an internal incubator program for experimental projects — to start Goodcall after recognizing the call problem, noting that in fact 60% of the calls that come into merchants go unanswered.</p>
<p>“It’s frustrating for you and for the person calling,” Summers told TechCrunch. “Every missed call is a lost opportunity.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Goodcall announced its launch Wednesday with $4 million in seed funding led by strategic investors Neo, Foothill Ventures, Merus Capital, Xoogler Ventures, Verissimo Ventures and VSC Ventures, as well as angel investors including Harry Hurst, founder and co-CEO of Pipe.com, and Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196344" style="width: 356px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196344" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2196344" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?w=346" alt="" width="346" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png 816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=153,300 153w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=768,1510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=346,680 346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=781,1536 781w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196344" class="wp-caption-text">Goodcall mobile agent. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Goodcall</p></div></p>
<p>Restaurants, shops and merchants can set up on Goodcall in a matter of minutes and even establish a local phone number to free up an owner’s mobile number from becoming the business’ main line. The service is initially deployed in English and the company has plans to operate in Spanish, French and Hindi by 2022.</p>
<p>Merchants can choose from six different assistant voices and monitor the call logs and what the calls were about. Goodcall can also capture consumer sentiment, Summers said.</p>
<p>The company offers three options, including its freemium service for solopreneurs and business owners, which includes up to 500 minutes per month of Goodcall services for a single phone line. Up to five additional locations and five staff members costs $19 per month for the Pro level, or the Premium level provides unlimited locations and staff for $49 per month.</p>
<p>During the company’s beta period, Goodcall was processing several thousands of calls per month. The new funding will be used to continue to offer the free service, hire engineers and continue product development.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding round, Goodcall is unveiling a partnership with Yelp to tap into its database of local businesses so that those owners and managers can easily deploy Goodcall. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/yelp-says-more-than-500000-new-businesses-opened-in-past-year.html">Yelp data shows</a> that more than 500,000 businesses opened during the pandemic. The company pulls in from Yelp a merchant’s open hours, location, if they offer Wi-Fi and even their COVID policy.</p>
<p>“We are partnering with Yelp, which has the best data on small businesses, and other large distribution channels to get our product to market,” Summers said. “We are bringing technology into an industry that hasn’t innovated since the 1980s and democratizing conversational AI for small businesses that are the main driver of job creation, and we want to help them grow.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Private equity firm Apollo Global Management this morning <a href="https://www.apollo.com/stockholders/press-releases/2021/09-01-2021-161530593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that it has completed its acquisition of Yahoo</a> (formerly known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/05/i-come-to-bury-oath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verizon Media Group, itself formerly known as Oath)</a> from Verizon. The deal is worth $5 billion, with $4.25 billion in cash, plus preferred interests of $750 million. Verizon will be retaining 10% of the newly rebranded company.</p>
<p>“This is a new era for Yahoo,” Yahoo CEO (and former VZM head) Guru Gowrappan said in a release tied to the news. “The close of the deal heralds an exciting time of renewed opportunity for us as a standalone entity. We anticipate that the coming months and years will bring fresh growth and innovation for Yahoo as a business and a brand, and we look forward to creating that future with our new partners.”</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/verizon-media-leadership-in-doubt-ahead-of-apollo-acquisition-on-sept-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that Gowrappan might not stay on as CEO of Yahoo for the long term now that the deal has closed; for now he&#8217;s still at the helm.</p>
<p>In addition to its titular Yahoo properties (Mail, Sports, Finance, et al.), the group includes us, TechCrunch; AOL; Engadget and interactive media brand, RYOT. All told, the umbrella brand encompasses around 900 million monthly active users globally and is currently the third-largest internet property, per Apollo’s figures.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IwY1Pu8XQ2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/oath-brother/">Verizon to take a charge of up to $6.7B due to Oath and redundancies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Verizon to take a charge of up to $6.7B due to Oath and redundancies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/oath-brother/embed/#?secret=IwY1Pu8XQ2" data-secret="IwY1Pu8XQ2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deal puts to a close a years-long effort by Verizon to make a comprehensive move into online media, specifically around adtech, which ultimately proved to be too costly, mostly unprofitable, and finally not core enough to the telco&#8217;s bigger growth strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news comes during a tumultuous time for online media, amid increasing industry-wide consolidation, many felt within Verizon Media. Verizon acquired AOL in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-its-acquisition-of-aol-for-4-4b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 for $4.4 billion</a>, followed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/verizon-closes-4-5b-acquisition-of-yahoo-marissa-mayer-resigns-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying Yahoo for $4.5 billion two years later</a>, combining the two legacy media properties into a combined group named Oath. At the end of 2018, Oath wrote down $4.6 billion, following the merger.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how a new owner will steer that large ship differently, but one strategy &#8212; standard practice for PE firms &#8212; could involve Apollo selling off parts of the business or rationalizing it in other ways.</p>
<p>However, for its part, Apollo has promised to continue investing in the newly acquired proprieties, and it has secured all jobs at the time of handover for at least an initial period. The bigger firm of Apollo has a massive set of TMT holdings so it will be interesting to see how and if it leverages that, too.</p>
<p>“We look forward to partnering with Yahoo&#8217;s talented employee base to build on the company&#8217;s strong momentum and position the new Yahoo for long-term success as a standalone consumer internet and digital media leader,” Apollo Partner Reed Rayman said in the release. “We couldn’t be more excited about this next chapter for Yahoo as we look to invest in growth across the business, including accelerating its customer-first offerings and commerce capabilities, expanding its reach and enhancing the daily user experience.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Blueprint CEO Steve Berneman thinks that the $18 billion title insurance business should really be a $10 billion market. It was, we believe, the first time a startup discussed shrinking its market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://blueprinttitle.com/">Blueprint Title</a>, an insurtech startup working in the title insurance space, announced this morning that it closed a $16 million Series B. The new round was led by Forté Ventures. The startup previously raised an $8.5 million Series A in the final weeks of 2019.</p>
<p>While Blueprint is an insurtech startup and therefore fits into the neoinsurance cohort that we&#8217;ve tracked in recent quarters as a number of companies from the group have gone public, it&#8217;s somewhat distinct. Blueprint is different from the Roots and MetroMiles and Hippos that debuted via traditional IPOs or SPACs; it largely sells to business customers and has a very different product on offer.</p>
<p>The neoinsurance companies that went public in the last year and a half sell to consumers. Blueprint, in contrast, sells to professional groups looking for a better title insurance experience. That means its customer base is not made up of consumers hoping to cover their main residence, Blueprint CEO Steve Berneman told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>That means that the company&#8217;s go-to-market activities are distinct from its mates in the consumer-focused cohort and that its loss profile is very different.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eErw0xWi0F"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/embed/#?secret=eErw0xWi0F" data-secret="eErw0xWi0F" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Title insurance, Berneman said, has around a 1% to 4% claims rate, far lower than auto insurance, to pick an example. That means its risk profile is different, and its pricing less flexible; there&#8217;s less loss ratio to wring out of title insurance underwriting, so cost and delivery of service are even more important than in other insurance varietals.</p>
<p>According to the CEO, the title insurance market in the United States today is made up of four companies with around 90% market share. And thanks to rules requiring public pricing in many states, there&#8217;s alignment on pricing from some leading players. The result of market concentration and effective price harmonization is that Berneman thinks that the $18 billion title insurance business should really be a $10 billion market.</p>
<p>Our call with Blueprint was the first in which a startup discussed shrinking its market.</p>
<p>But the point is reasonable; if title insurance is mispriced, and Blueprint sells to corporate customers, it can likely offer profitable coverage at a lower-than-market price point &#8212; and grow quickly in the process. That appears to be the case, with the startup stating in a release that it anticipates 400% revenue growth in 2021 when compared to 2020.</p>
<p>That growth rate explains the Nashville-based company&#8217;s most recent round and what we presume was a stiff upsizing in its valuation.</p>
<p>As part of its funding round announcement, Blueprint also disclosed that it has purchased Southwest Land Title Insurance Company, an underwriting company. Berneman said that to shrink the title insurance market through more reasonable pricing, his company needs to be full-stack, i.e., both writing its own coverage and selling it. Otherwise, margins would leak on either side of its operations.</p>
<p>Blueprint, akin to Next Insurance, is a startup bet that selling insurance to business customers will prove to be a lucrative effort. Given that consumer-focused neoinsurance providers have seen Wall Street change its tune on their value, it will be interesting to watch this more B2B cohort grow and eventually debut.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The recent round followed by a quick direct listing means that we'll be able to mock Sequoia if Amplitude winds up worth more than $4.15 billion when it floats.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amplitude is going public in a direct listing that will see its shares trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol &#8220;AMPL.&#8221; The company first <a href="https://amplitude.com/press/amplitude-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-for-proposed-direct-listing">announced</a> its intention to direct list in July and filed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1866692/000119312521260696/d143868ds1.htm#toc143868_16">its S-1 document</a> in August.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup lists major shareholders Battery, Benchmark, IVP, Sequoia and Jasmine Ventures in its S-1 filing. Each of those investors owns at least 5% of the company.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We&#8217;re curious why the company is direct listing instead of raising capital in its debut. We also want to understand how the company sees the future, because its product thesis is essentially a roadmap to its long-term growth; how investors value the company will in part hinge on whether Wall Street agrees with where Amplitude sees technology heading.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ll do our usual work to understand the company&#8217;s revenue mix and quality, wrapping with some noodling on what it may be worth. Sound fun? Good. Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>Amplitude&#8217;s core product thesis</h2>
<p>Most S-1 filings are full of corporate babble that I don&#8217;t drag you through. After all, we don&#8217;t <em>really</em> need to chat about how a particular vertical SaaS company thinks that its chosen niche is a great market. You already know what the debuting concern thinks. But with Amplitude, I want to do a bit more.</p>
<p>Amplitude sells what it calls &#8220;digital optimization&#8221; software. In practice, that means its software helps other companies design better software.</p>
<p>The company thinks that the way that digital products are built has changed. Gone are the days, in its view, of trusting intuition when it comes to digital design choices. Instead, Amplitude expects that companies with digital products will instead lean on data-driven decision-making. Or as it phrased it in its filing, digital product design is leaving the &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; phase for a more &#8220;Moneyball&#8221; era.</p>
<p>Data is at the core of how Amplitude sees companies designing future products. But in its view, many companies currently rely on a collection of disparate software tools to collect data on their digital footprint. Amplitude thinks it has a better method of collecting digital user data &#8212; and learning from it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many of us have not switched insurance carriers because we don’t want to deal with the hassle of comparison shopping?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot, I’d bet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://insurify.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that wants to help make it easier for people to get better rates on home, auto and life insurance, announced that it has closed $100 million in an “oversubscribed” Series B funding round led by Motive Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Viola FinTech, MassMutual Ventures, Nationwide, Hearst Ventures and Moneta VC also put money in the round, as well as new investors Viola Growth and Fort Ross Ventures. With the new financing, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Insurify has now raised a total of $128 million since its 2013 inception. The company declined to disclose the valuation at which the money was raised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we last covered Insurify, the startup has seen some impressive growth. For example, it has seen its new and recurring revenue increase by “6x” since it closed its Series A funding in the 2019 fourth quarter. Over the last three years, Insurify has achieved a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 151%, according to co-founder and CEO Snejina Zacharia. It has also seen consistent “2.5x” year-over-year revenue growth, she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify has built a machine learning-based virtual insurance agent that integrates with more than 100 carriers to digitize &#8212; and personalize &#8212; the insurance shopping experience. There are others in the insurtech space, but none that we know of currently tackling home, auto </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life insurance. For example, Jerry, which has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/jerry-raises-75m-at-a-450m-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised capital twice</span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/ai-powered-jerry-raises-28m-to-help-you-save-money-on-car-insurance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is focused mostly on auto insurance, although it does have a home product. The Zebra, which </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/austins-newest-unicorn-insurtech-the-zebra-raises-150m-after-doubling-revenue-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">became a unicorn this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">started out as a site for people looking for auto insurance via its real-time quote comparison tool. Over time, it has also evolved to offer homeowners insurance with the goal of eventually branching out into renters and life insurance. But it too is mostly focused on auto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zacharia said that since Insurify’s Series A funding, it has expanded its home insurance marketplace, deepened its carrier integrations to provide users an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“instant” purchase experience and launched its first two embedded insurance products through partnerships with Toyota Insurance Management Solutions and Nationwide (the latter of which also participated in the Series B funding round).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, when SkyScanner had to lay off staff, Insurify scooped up much of its engineering team and established an office in Sofia, Bulgaria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zacharia, a former Gartner executive, was inspired to start the company after she was involved in a minor car accident while getting her MBA at MIT. The accident led to a spike in her insurance premium and Zacharia was frustrated by the “complex and cumbersome” experience of car insurance shopping. She teamed up with Chief Product Officer Tod Kiryazov and her husband KAYAK President Giorgos Zacharia to build Insurify, which they describe as a virtual insurance agent that offers real-time quotes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We decided to build the most trusted virtual insurance agent in the industry that allows for customers to easily search, compare and buy fully digitally &#8212; directly from their mobile phone, or desktop, and really get a very smart, personalized experience based on their unique preferences,” Zacharia told TechCrunch. “We leverage artificial intelligence to be able to make recommendations on both coverage as well as carrier selection.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Insurify is also a fully licensed agent that takes over the fulfillment and servicing of the policies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the company is mostly working as an insurance agent, it gets paid new and renewed commission. So while it’s not a SaaS business, its embedded insurance offerings have SaaS-like monetization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to provide an experience for the end consumer that allows them to service and manage all of their policies in one place, digitally,” Zacharia said. “We think that the data recommendations that the platform provides can really remove most of the friction that currently exists in the shopping experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify plans to use its fresh capital to continue to expand its operations and accelerate its growth plans. It also, naturally, wants to add to its 125-person team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to build into our API integrations so customers can receive real-time direct quotes with better personalization and a more tailored experience,” Kiryazov said. “We also want to identify more embedded insurance opportunities and expand the product functionality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also down the line wants to expand into other verticals such as pet insurance, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify intends to use the money in part to build brand awareness, potentially through TV advertising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Almost half of our revenue comes from self-directed traffic,” Zacharia said. “So we want to explore more inorganic growth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James “Jim” O’Neill, founding partner at Motive Partners and industry partner Andy Rear point out that o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nline purchasing now accounts for almost all of the growth in U.S. auto insurance. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lesson from other markets which have been through this transition is that customers prefer choice, presented as a simple menu of products and prices from different insurers, and a straightforward online purchasing process,” they wrote via email. “The U.S. auto market is huge: even a slow transition to online means a massive opportunity for Insurify.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conducting their due diligence, the pair said they were impressed with how the startup is building a business model “that works for customers, insurers and white-label partners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harel Beit-On, founder and general partner at Viola Growth, believes that the quantum leap in e-commerce due to COVID-19 will completely transform the buying experience in almost every sector, including insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is time to bring the frictionless purchasing experience that customers expect to the insurance space as well,” she said. “Following our fintech fund&#8217;s recent investment in the company, we watched Insurify’s immense growth, excellent execution with customer acquisition and building a brand consumers trust.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/">Cox Automotive</a> is getting into the electric vehicle battery lifecycle business.</p>
<p>The company said Wednesday it acquired Oklahoma City-based <a href="http://www.spiersnewtechnologies.com/">Spiers New Technologies</a> (SNT), a business that provides repair, remanufacturing, refurbishing and repurposing services for EV battery packs.</p>
<p>The two companies did not disclose the terms of the deal. Cox said the acquisition will help it establish its battery servicing offerings, particularly as “EVs take center stage.” It added that electric vehicles have completely different service profiles than their internal combustion engine vehicle counterparts, and much of that comes down to the battery. EV battery support is particularly critical as the battery pack itself can comprise as much as 40% of the vehicle’s cost.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AZiR0QabiF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/">Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/embed/#?secret=AZiR0QabiF" data-secret="AZiR0QabiF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Even as federal investment in electric vehicles grow, and more automakers announce billions to build out their EV businesses, public skepticism remains. Eight out of 10 people not considering purchasing an EV are skeptical about the value of the battery and its useful life, according to research conducted by Cox.</p>
<p>This is not Cox’s only foray into EV battery management; the company also builds a battery health diagnostic tool with SNT that uses Spiers’ software platform, Alfred. Cox said it would use the diagnostic tool to push greater confidence in electric vehicles, likening it to the way that Kelley Blue Book has provided greater transparency about ICE vehicles’ condition for consumers.</p>
<p>The acquisition will also give Cox a stake in the battery repurposing business. Spiers is one of a few companies that specializes giving EV batteries a “second life” after they are no longer fit for use in a vehicle. Around 80% to 90% of the batteries SNT receives are from OEMs, with the rest from auto dismantlers, the company told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year. It’s a business segment that is likely only to grow as more EVs come off the roads, so the transaction is likely giving Cox a stake in end-of-life purposes as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthemis and 500 Startups co-led the investment, which included participation from ALLVP and Expa. Previously, Flat.mx had raised a total of $10 million in equity and $25 million in debt. Other backers include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/opendoor-to-go-public-by-way-of-chamath-palihapitiya-spac/">Opendoor</a> CEO and co-founder Eric Wu, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/homebuying-startup-flyhomes-closes-150-million-series-c/">Flyhomes’</a> co-founder and CEO Tushar Garg and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/divvy-homes-secures-110m-series-c-to-help-renters-become-homeowners/">Divvy Homes’</a> co-founder Brian Ma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in July 2019, Mexico City-based Flat.mx started out with a model similar to that of Opendoor, buying properties, renovating them and then reselling them. That September, the proptech startup had raised one of Mexico’s largest pre-seed rounds to take the Opendoor real estate marketplace model across the Rio Grande.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The real estate market in Mexico is broken,” said co-founder Bernardo Cordero. “One of the biggest problems is that it takes sellers anywhere from six months to two years to sell. So we launched the most radical solution we could find to this problem: an instant offer. This product allows homeowners to sell in days instead of months, a fast and convenient experience they can’t find anywhere else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an instant buyer (ibuyer) in Mexico &#8212; and Latin America in general &#8212; is a complex endeavor. Unlike in the U.S., Mexico doesn’t have a Multiple Listing Service (MLS). As such, pricing data is not readily available. On top of that, agents are not required to be certified, so the whole process of buying and selling a home can be informal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since mortgage penetration in Mexico is also low; it can be difficult for buyers to have access to reasonable financing options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To build an iBuyer, we had to solve the transaction end-to-end,” said co-founder Victor Noguera. “We had to build the MLS, a third-party marketplace, a contractor marketplace, financial products, broker technology and a home maintenance provider, along with other services. In other words, we have been building the real estate super app for LatAm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat.mx says its certified remodeled properties have gone through a 200+ point inspection and “a full legal review.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat.mx is growing sales by 70% quarter-over-quarter, and has increased its inventory by 10x over the last year, according to its founders. It has also nearly tripled its headcount from 30 at the middle of last year to over 85 today. So far, Flat.mx has conducted thousands of home valuations and more than 100 transactions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic only helped boost interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our low-touch digital solution was key for having a strong business during the pandemic. We were able to create quick liquidity for sellers at a time in Mexico where it was complicated to sell,” said Cordero. “Our model allows sellers to sell with one visit instead of having to receive over 40 potential buyers at a time where they wanted to sell but also wanted to avoid contact with many buyers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to continue to develop what it describes as a “one-stop shop where homeowners and buyers will be able to get all the services they need in one place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders believe that rather than just try to tackle one aspect of the homebuying process, it makes more sense in emerging markets to address them all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that each one of our products makes the others stronger and creating this ecosystem of products will continue to give us an important advantage in the market,” said Noguera. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to also use the capital from the round to expand its presence in Mexico for iBuying, and to invest in data and financial products.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196752" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196752" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196752 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="485" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?resize=680,485 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Flat-superapp-1390.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196752" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flat.mx</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Flat.mx&#8217;s investors are bullish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archie Cochrane, principal investor at Anthemis Group, said his firm views Flat.mx as an integral part of its embedded finance thesis in the context of the Mexican property sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The iBuyer model itself is well understood and developed in many parts of the world, but it is also a complex model with many variables that requires a seasoned and astute team to execute the strategy,” Cochrane wrote via email. &#8220;When we met Victor and Bernardo, it was clear that their clarity of vision and deep understanding of the broader opportunity set would allow them to succeed over the long term.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim Chae, managing partner at 500 Startups, said he envisions that Flat.mx will become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the go-to route” for buyers, sellers, agents and lenders in Mexican real estate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are nuances and specific problems that are unique to Mexico that Flat.mx has done a great job identifying and solving,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALLVP partner Fernando Lelo de Larrea said that essentially after years of “unkept promises,” software is finally transforming the real estate industry in Mexico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most models replicate successful models from the more mature U.S. proptech space,” he said. “Since we started investing in proptech, we’ve never seen such an innovative approach to seizing a trillion-dollar opportunity.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A stealthy startup co-founded by a former senior designer from Apple and one of its ex-senior software engineers has picked up a significant round of funding to build out its business. <a href="https://hu.ma.ne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humane</a>, which has ambitions to build a new class of consumer devices and technologies that stem from &#8220;a genuine collaboration of design and engineering&#8221; that will represent &#8220;the next shift between humans and computing&#8221;, has raised $100 million.</p>
<p>This is a Series B, and it&#8217;s coming from some very high-profile backers. Tiger Global Management is leading the round, with SoftBank Group, BOND, Forerunner Ventures and Qualcomm Ventures also participating. Other investors in this Series B include Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, Kindred Ventures, Marc Benioff&#8217;s TIME Ventures, Valia Ventures, NEXT VENTŪRES, Plexo Capital and the legal firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.</p>
<p>Humane has been around since 2017, but it closed/filed its Series A only last year: $30 million in September 2020 at a $150 million valuation, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/327321-91/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>. Previous to that, it had raised just under $12 million, with many of the investors in this current round backing Humane in those earlier fundraises, too.</p>
<p>Valuation with this Series B is not being disclosed, the company confirmed to me.</p>
<p>Given that Humane has not yet released any products, nor has said much at all about what it has up its sleeve, and given that hardware in general presents a lot of unique challenges and therefore is often seen as a risky bet (that old &#8220;hardware is hard&#8221; chestnut), you might be wondering how Humane, still in stealth, has attracted these backers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="emzYVTLw8R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/5-consumer-hardware-vcs-share-their-2021-investment-strategies/">5 consumer hardware VCs share their 2021 investment strategies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 consumer hardware VCs share their 2021 investment strategies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/5-consumer-hardware-vcs-share-their-2021-investment-strategies/embed/#?secret=emzYVTLw8R" data-secret="emzYVTLw8R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Some of that attention possibly stems from the fact that the two co-founders, husband-and-wife team Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, are something of icons in their own right. Bongiorno, who is Humane&#8217;s CEO, had been the software engineering director at Apple. Chaudhri, who is Humane&#8217;s chairman and president, is Apple&#8217;s former director of design, where he worked for 20 years on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/apple-watch-designer-reveals-the-devices-origins-on-its-fifth-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of its most seminal products</a> &#8212; the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac. Both have dozens of patents credited to them from their time there, and they have picked up a few since then, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those latest patents &#8212; plus the very extensive list of job openings listed on Humane&#8217;s otherwise quite sparse site &#8212; might be the closest clues we have for what the pair and their startup might be building.</p>
<p>One patent is for a &#8220;Wearable multimedia device and cloud computing platform with laser projection system&#8221;; another is for a &#8220;System and apparatus for fertility and hormonal cycle awareness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company currently has nearly 50 job openings listed, including engineers with camera and computer vision experience, hardware engineers, designers and security experts, among many others. (One sign of where all that funding will be going.) There is already an impressive team of about 60 people at the company, which is another detail that attracted investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The caliber of individuals working at Humane is incredibly impressive,&#8221; said Chase Coleman, partner, Tiger Global, in a statement. &#8220;These are people who have built and shipped transformative products to billions of people around the world. What they are building is groundbreaking with the potential to become a standard for computing going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked for more details on the company&#8217;s product roadmap and ethos behind the company, and who its customers might potentially be: other firms for whom it designs products, or end users directly?</p>
<p>For now, Bongiorno and Chaudhri seem to hint that part of what has motivated them to start this business was to reimagine what role technology might play in the next wave of innovation. It&#8217;s a question that many ask, but not many try to actually invest in finding the answer. For that alone, it&#8217;s worth watching Humane (if Humane lets us, that is: it&#8217;s still very much in stealth) to see what it does next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humane is a place where people can truly innovate through a genuine collaboration of design and engineering,&#8221; the co-founders said in a joint statement. &#8220;We are an experience company that creates products for the benefit of people, crafting technology that puts people first — a more personal technology that goes beyond what we know today. We&#8217;re all waiting for something new, something that goes beyond the information age that we have all been living with. At Humane, we&#8217;re building the devices and the platform for what we call the intelligence age. We are committed to building a different type of company, founded on our values of trust, truth and joy. With the support of our partners, we will continue to scale the team with individuals who not only share our passion for revolutionizing the way we interact with computing, but also for how we build.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: After publishing, I got a little more from Humane about its plans. Its aim is to build &#8220;t<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">echnology that improves the human experience and is born of good intentions; p</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">roducts that put us back in touch with ourselves, each other, and the world around us; and e</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">xperiences that are built on trust, with interactions that feel magical and bring joy.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a whole lot to go on, but more generally it&#8217;s an approach that seems to want to step away from the cycle we&#8217;re on today, and be more mindful and thoughtful. If they can execute on this, while still building rather than wholesale rejecting technology, they might be on to something.</span></p>
