										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mental health has been put into the spotlight in a big way in recent times. For many of us, our lives and lifestyles have changed massively in the last year, and alongside that, we&#8217;re collectively facing pandemic-fueled mortality on a global scale in a way that hasn&#8217;t existed for generations, a perfect storm of sorts that has inevitably had an impact on our state of mind and our moods.</p>
<p>Today a startup that has built a platform to help people think about and respond to this situation is announcing a big round of growth funding, specifically to help address all of this and how it plays out in one of the more stress-inducing aspects of our life &#8212; our workplaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://unmind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unmind</a> &#8212; a London startup that has built a mental health app for the workplace &#8212; has raised $47 million, a Series B that it will be using to continue investing in its research and development and also to expand its business reach. The funding is being led by EQT Ventures –- a very <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/vinted-raises-303m-for-its-2nd-hand-clothes-marketplace-used-by-45m-and-now-valued-at-4-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active investor at the moment in UK growth rounds</a> &#8212; with participation also from Sapphire Ventures and previous backers Project A, Felix Capital, and True.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The core of Unmind&#8217;s service is an app built around a set of questions to help employees explore their own states of mental health, which could include depression, anxiety, insomnia, and a host of other manifestations. It provides advice and content to begin addressing the results of that &#8212; exercises, advice, podcasts, links for further reading, and links to seeing further help from professionals (not more machine interfaces, but humans). It also provides a service to the employers, sharing anonymized data from the app with them so that they, too, can consider how better to respond to their employees&#8217; needs.</p>
<p>The app has seen some notable traction especially in the last year, a time when the conversation about mental health has become much more commonplace and critical, given the environment we&#8217;ve been living in.</p>
<p>Unmind does not disclose user numbers, nor how they have grown, but it tells me that uptake and adoption of its app ranges from 15% to over 60% of an organization&#8217;s workforce (this varies by size, and the emphasis that the organization itself puts on using the app, among other things). It said that of those employees who are using Unmind, 88% have said they experience an improvement in mental wellbeing, work, or relationships, while 92% report higher confidence, awareness, and understanding of mental health.</p>
<p>The company also said that revenues grew by more than 3x in the last 12 months. Meanwhile, its customers include major retailers like John Lewis and M&amp;S, high street bank TSB, Uber, Samsung, Virgin Media, British Airways and Asos &#8212; a list of companies that have strong degrees of customer service around them, have been greatly impacted by the lockdowns, and you can imagine must have a lot of people working in them pretty stressed out as a result of being on the front lines of interfacing with a stressed-out wider population of consumers.</p>
<p>The company was co-founded by Dr Nick Taylor, who previously had been a clinical psychologist and worked for years in mental health care (and before that was a classically-trained singer), who said he came up with the idea after feeling like he was seeing too many people only for the first time at a stage when their issues were already very advanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kept encountering the same frustration time and again: I wish I’d met this person six months ago,&#8221; Taylor said in an interview.</p>
<p>As with all kinds of preventative healthcare, it&#8217;s always better to identify and work on issues before they grow big and more urgent, and so he set out to think about how one might approach the concept of a preventative check-up and check-in for mental health.</p>
<p>The workplace is not a bad place to base that effort. Not only is it often a source of stress for people, but it&#8217;s a regular place for them to be every day so creating a way of assessing mental health through that implicitly creates a kind of routine to the effort. It also potentially means a closer connection to the employer to work on issues more collectively when and if they emerge, in a way that the employer might not do (or ever discover) through other means.</p>
<p>The connection between work and mental health is a longstanding one but has perhaps been proven out more than ever before in the last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn’t know what would happen with mental health during Covid,&#8221; Taylor recalled. &#8220;I actually wondered if it would be demoted,&#8221; given all of the other conflicting priorities. &#8220;But the prevalence of mental illness has escalated. It&#8217;s out of control. And in the workplace, it&#8217;s a leading cause of absenteeism and turnover.&#8221; And given how full-on everything has become, including likely more hours spent working since now it all has merged with our home lives, we all know (and may well be among) many people who are feeling incredibly burned out right now.</p>
<p>Taylor said that in fact quite the opposite has happened to his early skepticism: mental health has become front of mind, &#8220;and the shackles of stigma are falling away.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is part of what has really caught the eye of investors: technology that is not just effective, but very relevant to right now. “It is now universally recognized that our Mental Health is as important if not more important than our physical health &#8211; but has long been neglected. That is now changing rapidly,&#8221; said Alastair Mitchell, a partner at EQT Ventures. &#8220;As a result there has been a massive rise in the popularity of consumer mental health apps which is now being matched by surging demand from employers and employees for the same in the workplace. Unmind is the leading mental health app for the enterprise and we are so excited to work with Dr Nick and the team to support their scaling globally.&#8221; EQT is also a strategic investor, not just a financial one: it&#8217;s rolling out Unmind across its own workplace and its many portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Unmind, it should be noted, is not the only company that has identified this &#8220;opportunity,&#8221; if you could call it that. They include other startups like SF-based <a href="https://www.ginger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ginger</a> &#8212; which has also built a platform that partners with employers, but also healthcare providers and other stakeholders, to help people identify and manage their state of mind. Ginger has been <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200806005244/en/Ginger-Announces-50-Million-in-Series-D-Funding-to-Expand-Access-to-the-World%E2%80%99s-First-On-Demand-Mental-Healthcare-System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-capitalised</a> over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ginger-an-mit-spinout-providing-app-based-mental-health-coaching-to-workers-raises-35m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the years</a>. Others in the same space include Welbot in New York, Spill also out of London and a host of others providing different aspects of mental wellness like Calm and Headspace, the meditation apps.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m inclined to think that, given the size of the problem and that mental health should not be a bunfight but something that takes a village to address, the key will be in how each company approaches its remit, and how people respond to it, and whether what people do ultimately use results in better bridges for employees to getting the help and peace they need, whether it&#8217;s from the app or a professional.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We have a responsibility to connect with our mental health in the same way that we do when it comes to healthcare,&#8221; Taylor said, likening the effort to how it takes a number of skill sets sometimes to work on the complexities of a health issue. &#8220;Great healthcare integrates across a number of systems.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When eventually they become a working reality, Quantum computers won’t be of much value if they simply sit there on their own. Just like the internet, the value is in the network. But right now there’s scant technology to link these powerful devices together.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://qphox.eu/">QphoX</a> comes in. Thus Dutch startup has raised €2 million to connect Quantum computers with a ‘Quantum modem’.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Quantonation, Speedinvest, and High-Tech Gründerfonds, with participation from TU Delft.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>QphoX aims to develop the Quantum Modem it created at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) into a commercial product. This networks separate processors together, allowing quantum computers to scale beyond 10’s or 100’s of qubits. Look out for the Singularity folks…</p>
<p>Simon Gröblacher, CEO and co-founder of QphoX told me: “It is the exact same thing as a classical modem except for quantum computers, so it kind of converts electrical and microwave signals to optical signals coherently, so you don&#8217;t do any of the quantum information in the process. It then converts it back so you can really have two quantum computers talk to one another.</p>
<p>I noted that there’s more than one type of quantum computer. He countered  “We are in principle agnostic to what kind of quantum computer it is. All we do at the moment is we focus on the microwave part, so we can work with superconducting qubits, topological qubits etc. We can convert microwaves to optical signals and they can talk to each other. Currently, the only competitors I know are all the in the academic world. So this is we&#8217;re the first company to actually starts building a real product.”</p>
<p>Rick Hao, Principal with Speedinvest’s Deep Tech team, added: “ We want to invest in seed-stage deep technology startups that shape the future and QphoX is well-positioned to make a major impact. Over the next couple of years, there will be rapid progress in quantum computers. Quantum Modem, the product developed by QphoX, enables the development of quantum computers that demonstrate quantum advantage by combining separate quantum processors.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vacation rental startup <a href="https://www.holidu.com">Holidu</a> has tucked $45 million in Series D funding into its suitcase &#8212; bringing its total raised since being founded back in 2014 to more than $120M.</p>
<p>The latest funding round is led by 83North with participation from existing investors Prime Ventures, EQT ventures, Coparion, Senovo, Kees Koolen, Lios Ventures and Chris Hitchen. Also participating, with both equity and debt, is Claret Capital (formerly Harbert European Growth Capital).</p>
<p>The financing will be ploughed into product development; doubling the size of the tech team; and on building out partnerships to keep expanding supply, Holidu said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the global pandemic clearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/three-travel-startups-tell-us-how-theyre-responding-to-the-coronavirus-crisis/">hasn&#8217;t been kind</a> to much of the travel industry, the Munich-headquartered startup has been able to benefit from coronavirus-induced shifts in traveller behavior.</p>
<p>People who may have booked city breaks or hotels pre-COVID-19 are turning to private holiday accommodation in greater numbers than before &#8212; so they can feel safer about going on holiday and perhaps enjoy more space and fresh air than they&#8217;ve had at home during coronavirus lockdowns.</p>
<p>Having flexible cancelation options is also now clearly front of mind for travellers &#8212; and Holidu credits moving quickly to build in flexible cancellation and payment solutions with helping fuel its growth during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Holidu&#8217;s meta search engine compares listings on sites like Airbnb, Booking.com, HomeAway and Vrbo and provides holidaymakers with tools to zoom in on relevant rentals &#8212; offering granular filters for property amenities; property type; and distances to the beach/lake etc.</p>
<p>It can also be used to search only for listings with a free cancelation policy.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Airbnb plans for a new kind of travel post-COVID with flexible search&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/airbnb-plans-for-a-new-kind-of-travel-post-covid-with-flexible-search/embed/#?secret=AbP8vzz5jY" data-secret="AbP8vzz5jY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We see that many travellers have chosen vacation rentals in rural destinations over hotels or cities,&#8221; confirms CEO and co-founder Johannes Siebers. &#8220;In spite of this shift in preference, the overall European vacation rental market declined in 2020 due to the strong travel restrictions in many months. Holidu managed to grow against this trend by responding very quickly to the increased demand for domestic lodging and for flexible cancellation options.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup saw year-over-year growth of circa 50% in 2020 &#8212; and greater than 2x growth in its contribution margin, per Siebers.</p>
<p>&#8220;[That] enabled us to become profitable with our search business,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Revenues for 2021 are still difficult to forecast due to the uncertain pandemic and political outlook but we expect a significantly higher growth rate compared to 2020.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holidu is active in 21 countries with its search engine &#8212; which now combines more than 15M vacation rental offers from over a thousand travel sites and property managers. In July 2020 alone, it said that more than 27M travellers used the product.</p>
<p>Its search engine business has a mixed business model, with Holidu taking a commission per click with a minority of its partners and earning a commission for each booking generated with the majority.</p>
<p>In another strand of its business, under the Bookiply brand, it works directly with property owners to help them maximize bookings via a software-and-service solution &#8212; offering to take the digital management strain in exchange for a cut of (successful) bookings.</p>
<p>Back in 2019 it was managing 5,000 properties via Bookiply. Now Siebers says it&#8217;s &#8220;on track&#8221; to grow to more than 10,000 properties by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Bookiply has become the largest supplier of vacation rentals in what it described as &#8220;important leisure destinations&#8221; such as the Balearic Islands, Canary Islands and Sardinia (which are all very popular holiday destinations with German travellers).</p>
<p>Part of the Series D funding will go on opening more Bookiply offices across Europe so it can grow its service offering for regional vacation rental owners.</p>
<p>The division aims to reach property owners whose properties are not yet online, as well as optimizing digital listings that aren&#8217;t doing as well as they might, so having physical service locations is a strategy to help with onboarding owners who may be newbies to digital listing.</p>
<p>Commenting on the funding in a statement, Laurel Bowden, partner at 83North said: “Vacation rentals are a very competitive market and Holidu’s growth throughout the pandemic has been highly impressive. We are attracted by their strong operating efficiency and proven ability to grow market by market.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last year Holidu was among scores of startups in the travel, accommodation and jobs sectors that signed a letter to the European Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/act-now-before-google-kills-us-135-strong-coalition-of-startups-warns-eu-antitrust-chief/">urging antitrust action against Google</a>.</p>
<p>The coalition accused the tech giant of unfairly leveraging its dominant position in search in order to elbow into other markets via tactics like self-preferencing, warning EU lawmakers that homegrown businesses were at risk without swift enforcement to rein in abusive behaviors.</p>
<p>Although in Holidu&#8217;s case it&#8217;s managed to grow despite the pandemic &#8212; and despite Google.</p>
<p>Asked how much of an ongoing concern Google&#8217;s behavior is for the growth of its business, Siebers told TechCrunch: &#8220;Given its size and market position, we believe Google carries a special responsibility in the search market. Furthermore, we believe in merit based competition to drive innovation and provide users with the best products. We have joined the letter to the EC as in our view, Google does not fully live up to its responsibilities in all areas of its product.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way Google displays specialized search products in many travel verticals does, in our view, not comply with the principle of fair, merit based competition. It gives Google’s own product eyeballs which no other player could attract in the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not yet seen noticeable changes in Google’s search box integration but we are confident that Google will eventually provide a level playing field. Even if this would take some time and is important, we are not overly worried as we have a very diversified business. Among others, with Bookiply we have a strongly growing offering towards homeowners which is independent of Google’s activities in the market,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Since the coalition wrote the letter the Commission has unveiled a legislative proposal to apply ex ante regulations to so called &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; platforms &#8212; a designation that looks highly likely to apply to Google, although the Digital Markets Act (DMA) is still a long way off becoming pan-EU law.</p>
<p>Siebers said Holidu supports this plan for a set of &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; that the most powerful platforms must abide by.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are supportive of the commission’s proposal and believe not only the act itself but also enforcement will drive innovation and better products for customers,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Enabling free and fair competition is a core deliverable for a regulator in a market place and we have high expectations towards the EU in this regard. If we achieve this, I am certain we will  see an  increase in innovation, investments and activities in areas which are currently impacted by gatekeeper’s activities.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce continues to be a huge focus for investors watching consumer behavior and spending patterns in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the latest development, UK startup <a href="https://www.lyst.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyst</a>, a portal for high fashion brands and stores to sell directly to users, has picked up $85 million, in what the startup is describing as a &#8216;pre-IPO&#8217; round.</p>
<p>The news comes as the company says that it has now grown to 150 million users browsing and buying from a catalog of 8 million products from 17,000 brands and retailers.</p>
<p>List said that gross merchandise value in 2020 was over $500 million, with new user numbers growing 1100%. GMV has definitely been accelerating. Lyst has been around since 2010 and said today that lifetime GMV is more than $2 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Lyst is rapidly becoming a fashion category leader, which hundreds of millions of fashion lovers rely on to decide what to buy. While our app and website already enjoy very large audiences in the USA &amp; Europe, fashion e-commerce remains under-penetrated in general, with huge growth potential globally. We’re excited to use this raise from top-tier investors to continue personalising the fashion shopping experience to each of our millions of customers, while helping our partner brands thrive,&#8221; said Chris Morton, Lyst&#8217;s CEO and founder, in a statement.</p>
<p>We have contacted the company to ask about the timing and location for a public listing and while it has not commented, we understand that London or New York would be the most obvious locations for a listing, which is not likely to be for another year or even three.</p>
<p>For now, Lyst has disclosed that investors in this latest injection include funds managed by Fidelity International, Novator Capital, Giano Capital and C4 Ventures, as well as a mix of financial and strategic previous backers Draper Esprit, 14W, Accel, Balderton Capital, Venrex and LVMH. Carmen Busquets &#8212; a strategic advisor to the company who co-founded Net-a-Porter, one of Lyst&#8217;s competitors in the space &#8212; also increased her investment in the company with this round, the company said.</p>
<p>Sources say the valuation is close to $700 million with this round, although the company is not confirming anything. (Also, with this the sources also say that <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/54808-75/company/profile#general-info">PitchBook&#8217;s</a> estimate of $500 million post-money is way off.) Sky News, where the funding news was <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/lyst-fashions-route-to-ipo-with-85m-funding-round-12303737" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked last night</a>, did not have a valuation figure.</p>
<p>For some further comparison and context, though, Farfetch, another competitor in the same space as Lyst, listed publicly some years ago and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FTCH?p=FTCH&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently has a market cap of $14.4 billion</a>. And more generally, there is a lot to play for here online, not just against other pure-play fashion portals, but also standalone retailers, marketplaces like Amazon, and increasingly social media apps like Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat, which are all looking at how they can better capitalize on the fact that their platforms are already being used quite aggressively and widely for social commerce.</p>
<p>Social media sites would be an ironic but perhaps very unsurprising competitor for Lyst, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/16/lyst-comes-out-of-the-closet-to-open-up-high-fashion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started life as a pioneer in the concept</a>, creating a way for people to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/20/lyst-doing-1m-sales-a-month-more-following-gucci-there-than-on-thefancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow influential high fashion brands</a> and influencers on its platform &#8212; who were not actually called &#8220;influencers&#8221; at the time, but curators and bloggers (the more things change, eh?) &#8212; and get alerts when tagged or in-demand items would be posted by labels or retailers for sale.</p>
<p>People might have originally been very skeptical about how well high fashion (read: expensive, sometimes esoteric) items might play over screens. Surely expensive has to equate to high-touch sales in lovely boutiques? But, over time, Lyst and the others in the same area have proved it all out in spades. And Lyst itself has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/23/lyst-a-fashion-e-commerce-aggregator-raises-14m-more-plans-beacon-rollout-with-paypal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successive rounds</a> over time to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/29/lvmh-accel-and-more-pour-40m-into-fashion-e-commerce-aggregator-lyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back up its premise</a>. Balenciaga, Balmain, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Fendi, Gucci, Moncler, Off-White, Prada, Saint Laurent and Valentino are among the brands that appear on its platform today.</p>
<p>Over the years, more variations and competitors have presented themselves, but the salient fact remains that high fashion has a huge target audience if delivered in the right way, and that is something that investors, brands, influencers, and these marketplaces themselves have all doubled down on in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Consumers, too. It&#8217;s been a time when people who have luckily not found themselves outright struggling financially &#8212; and there are those, too, unfortunately &#8212; have instead discovered they more disposable income than usual, since going out to restaurants, travelling and other expenses have gone out the door, so to speak.</p>
<p>In contrast, fashion and overall buying more goods for ourselves have become a form of escapism. And for those who get a lift out of the tree falling in the forest <em>and </em>being there to hear the sound, we can still put on the outfits, snap ourselves for our Stories, and exposure will still be ours.</p>
<p>“Lyst has made huge progress over the past year with its industry leading app for the fast- growing online luxury fashion market – a trend which looks set to continue as consumers retain their newfound digital habits, and demand for fashion rises further post-pandemic. In recent years we have seen other high-growth fashion tech businesses taking the next step, and we believe Lyst is well positioned to capitalise on this market momentum. Draper Esprit has backed Lyst since Series A and we believe this latest round sets the business up for an exciting next phase,&#8221; said Nicola McClafferty, a partner, Draper Esprit, in a statement.</p>
<p>Lyst also announced a few appointments to firm up its executive bench in the lead-up to its next steps as a company. Mateo Rando previously at Spotify, is joining as chief product officer to focus largely on Lyst&#8217;s popular mobile app. And Emma McFerran, formerly general counsel and chief people officer, is stepping up as COO and a new board member.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Swarmia.com">Swarmia</a>, a B2B SaaS company for software development teams dealing with data, has raised a €5.7 M Seed round and a previously unannounced 1M€ pre-seed round, taking its raise to €6.7M ($8M). The Seed round was led by Alven Capital and joined by Jigsaw VC, Irena Goldenberg, Alex Algard, Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen, Jonathan Benhamou and Romain Huet. Lifeline Ventures, the sole investor in a previously unannounced 1M€ pre-seed round, also participated. The cash wil be used to scale to the US.</p>
<p>Founder Otto Hilska is a serial entrepreneur who started Flowdock (team collaboration product, acquired by Rally Software) and was Smartly.io&#8217;s  Chief Product Officer.</p>
<p>Hilska says many software development organizations could be much more successful if they had a &#8220;better visibility to their work and a systematic approach for continuous improvement”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Swarmia integrates with development tools such as GitHub, Jira, Linear and various CI tools to &#8220;create a holistic view to the engineering teams&#8217; inner workings.”</p>
<p>Competitors include Pluralsight Flow (raised $192.5M) and CodeClimate Velocity ($15M).</p>
<p>However, Hilska says: &#8220;We&#8217;re the only product in the market that&#8217;s actually used by developers themselves. We don&#8217;t build features for stalking individual developers, but rather focus on how the team can improve. We&#8217;ve built the product together with our pilot customers (with shared Slack channels and daily iteration) to make sure that it actually scales with them. Every team is different, and our product adapts to these different ways of working by letting teams define their Working Agreements. That leads to much better data quality, since we actually understand how the teams work – while competitors are happy to plot any incorrect data. Our Slack bot also helps teams drive the behavioral change when teams choose to adopt a working agreement.”</p>
<p>Thomas Cuvelier, Partner at Alven commented: &#8220;Software is eating the world but software engineering, the largest cost center of the modern organization, is still a black box. Swarmia solves a considerable pain point by bringing visibility to engineering work and helping executives make the right business decisions based on data rather than anecdotal evidence. What Otto and his team have achieved so far is impressive and they&#8217;re well on their way to drive better working habits for the world&#8217;s 27m developers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://quix.ai/">Quix</a>, a platform for Python developers working on streaming data, has secured a £2.3 Million ($3.2M)Seed funding round led by Project A Ventures in Germany, with participation from London’s Passion Capital and angel investors. The Quix Portal is also providing developers with a free subscription to a real-time data engineering platform.</p>
<p>Quix attracted angel investors including Frank Sagnier (CEO, Codemasters), Ian Hogarth (Co-author,  State of AI Report), Chris Schagen (CMO, Contentful), and Michael Schrezenmaier (COO, Pipedrive).</p>
<p>Quix wants to change the way data is handled and processed from a database-centric approach to a &#8216;stream-centric&#8217; approach, connecting machine learning models to real-time data streams. This is arguably the next paradigm in computing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Use cases for Quix, it says, include developing electric vehicles, and fraud prevention in financial services. Some of its early customers are the NHS, Deloitte and McLaren.</p>
<p>Indeed, the founding team consists of former McLaren F1 engineers who are used to processing real-time data streams from the systems used by most Formula 1 teams.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Michael Rosam said: &#8220;At Quix, we believe that it will soon be essential for every organization to automatically action data within milliseconds of it being created. Whether it’s personalizing digital experiences, developing electric  vehicles, automating industrial machinery, deploying smart wearables in healthcare, or detecting financial fraud faster, the ability to run machine learning models on live data streams and immediately respond to rapidly changing environments is critical to  delivering better experiences and outcomes to people.”</p>
<p>Over email he told me that Quix’s main advantage is that it allows developers to build streaming applications on Kafka without investing in cloud infrastructure first: &#8220;Uniquely, our API &amp; SDK connects any Python code directly to the broker so that teams can run real-time machine learning models in-memory, reducing latency and cost compared to database-centric architectures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quix is entering the data ecosystem alongside batch data processing platforms like Snowflake and Databricks, and event streaming platforms like Confluent, Materialize, and DBT. However, this ecosystem is very complementary with organizations usually combining multiple products into a production infrastructure based on the strengths of each proposition.</p>
<p>Sam Cash of Project A Ventures said: “Data streaming is the next paradigm in data architecture, given end-users accelerating demand for live, on-demand and personalized applications. The Quix team are leading  the way in this market, by democratizing access to data streaming infrastructure, which until now has been the reserve of the largest companies.”</p>
<p>Malin Posern, Partner at Passion Capital commented: “The world today is generating unimaginable amounts of data from digital and physical activities. Businesses of all types and sizes will want to make use of their  data in real-time in order to be competitive.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The circular economy &#8212; where consumers themselves are both the suppliers and buyers of goods and services &#8212; has come into its own in the last year of lockdown living as a popular and trusted way to buy and sell things. Now one of the larger players in that system &#8212; the clothes and home goods marketplace <a href="https://www.vinted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vinted</a> &#8212; is circling in on some very big money of its own. The European startup is today announcing that it has closed an all-equity round of €250 million ($303 million at today&#8217;s rates), funding that values the company pre-money at €3.5 billion ($4.2 billion, or $4.5 billion post-money).</p>
<p>The funding is being led by EQT Growth, with Accel, Burda Principal Investments, Insight Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Sprints Capital &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; also participating. This is a big jump for Vinted, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/vinted-the-second-hand-clothes-marketplace-raises-141m-at-a-1b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $1 billion in its round at the end of 2019</a>. That, of course, was just before the pandemic hit &#8212; a sign of how much the last year has positively impacted both Vinted and that business model as a whole.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a huge deal for the company as well as the country that&#8217;s produced the startup. Founded out of Vilnius, Lithuania, in 2008, Vinted has operations across 13 markets &#8212; France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Luxembourg, UK and the U.S. &#8212; and will be using the funding to double down on that while moving deeper into markets further afield, like its U.S. operation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Altogether across that footprint, Vinted currently has some 45 million users (which is a neat number in this case: 45 million=$4.5 billion valuation), who upload their own items of clothes or home goods to sell or buy those uploaded by others. Users pay no fees for listing, but Vinted takes a &#8220;buyer protection&#8221; rate that is either between 3% and 8% of the cost of an item, or a direct cut (in the UK &#8211; between £0.03 and £0.08), depending on the value of the good.</p>
<p>(Note: buyer protection also actually <em>is</em> buyer protection, and the terms of that are<a href="https://www.vinted.co.uk/help/550?access_channel=hc_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> set out here</a>.)</p>
<p>The circular economy is often thought of as a useful system that not only helps get more life out of things in a sustainable way, but gives people a better deal by cutting out some of the others from the retail chain. That&#8217;s been a very compelling concept in the last year, where people have been spending more time at home and looking to declutter those spaces, or out of work and looking to make extra money or save some money, or simply rethinking how the world is working and how we got to where we are today, and trying to do their small part in engaging with their communities in a different way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also one of the oldest and most primitive kinds of selling techniques. Pre-dating shopping malls and Amazon and the like, you could say being more circular is just in our bones.</p>
<p>However, in more direct, prosaic terms, we have also injected a lot of actual money into the circular economy concept.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/the-circular-economy-could-unlock-4-5-trillion-of-economic-growth-finds-new-book-by-accenture.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015</a>, researchers estimated that the wider circular economy was a $4.5 trillion opportunity (this includes the many services as well as goods sold between people). Last November, it was estimated that <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/sustainability/fashions-circular-economy-could-be-worth-5-trillion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fashion alone was a $5 trillion circular economy opportunity</a> &#8212; a sign of just what an impact Covid-19 has had on the model. Some have even posited that the role of the circular economy might even <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/The-circular-economy-a-transformative-Covid19-recovery-strategy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help some of the most impacted communities</a> pull themselves out from under the negative economic effects of this virus.</p>
<p>Vinted is not the only company that is capitalizing on this. Wallapop, another second-hand swapping marketplace out of Spain, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/spains-wallapop-raises-191m-at-an-840m-valuation-for-its-classifieds-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently raised $191 million</a>. The question will be which of these circular economy players will, ironically, be the most sustainable in and of themselves. eBay, which was something of a circular economy pioneer online, has also seen a big boost in sales in the last year. However, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ebay-shares-drop-on-guidance-miss-despite-first-quarter-revenue-growth-11619643271" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last quarter</a> it warned that some signs that its uplift might be fading.</p>
<p>Indeed, maybe in keeping with the practicality of what it has built &#8212; no use throwing out perfectly good things! &#8212; Vinted itself is very no-nonsense and does not talk up its business even when it appears to be going really well.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last 18 months have been challenging,&#8221; CEO Thomas Plantenga said flatly in an interview.</p>
<p>The company actually halted operations altogether for around the first two months of the pandemic hitting Europe, in order to figure out how to proceed with its marketplace while keeping people Covid-safe and not violating any rules imposed on activities in different markets.</p>
<p>Things bounced back pretty quickly after that, he conceded, but it&#8217;s also a sign of how quick the switch can be between feast and famine in this business. Plantegna himself was brought into the company some years ago when it was struggling then to help it with a restructuring turnaround strategy, one indication that simply being a second-hand marketplace isn&#8217;t necessarily as turnkey as it sounds.</p>
<p class="p2">And so part of the company&#8217;s power has been in its focus. Plantenga said that Vinted is pretty strict on enforcing that the marketplace is only used for fashion and home goods (which are adjacent to fashion): no cars, no large furniture, no pets, no meal kits. And no channel for brands or retailers to resell seconds on the platform &#8212; which would have seemed like an obvious category to add to a marketplace where people are looking for fashion bargains, but is not in keeping with the company&#8217;s ethos, he said.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Yes, it could be a big opportunity, but we have purposely said no to that,&#8221; Pantenga said. He acknowledged that overproduction was one of the many issues in the fashion industry, but not one Vinted was going to address itself. &#8220;We don’t feel it’s our job to solve that problem. We want more to fix consumer trends. All those issues around fashion industry and production, there are many of them. But we are focused on second hand being your first choice. Yes, it could be a great way to grow GMV, but that’s not how we strategize.&#8221;</p>
<p>Longer term, the company also plans to create an avenue to make it easier for people to upload and sell goods on the platform for charity.</p>
<p>In countries like the UK, charity shops are a significant channel for used goods, where people don&#8217;t offload the items to make money but to help organizations like Oxfam or the British Heart Foundation, which sell them in physical stores along the high streets of the UK to raise much-needed funds for their activities. Plantenga said that Vinted is working on a way right now to give sellers the option to upload to sell for a charity of their choice, or for those buying to donate their fee to charity. This is currently being tested in Vinted&#8217;s French operations, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vinted is transforming the second-hand fashion market across Europe through their customer-centric approach and extraordinary execution,&#8221; said EQT Growth Partner Carolina Brochado, in a statement. &#8220;Vinted is the perfect example of EQT Growth&#8217;s strategy of backing fast-growing European tech champions that tap into several macro trends, such as the increasing consumer demand for sustainability and continued penetration of online channels within fashion. We&#8217;re immensely proud and excited to be supporting Thomas and the Vinted team and we cannot wait to work together to further unlock the market for circular fashion.&#8221; She is also joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot of 9 CryptoPunks portraits ended up selling for <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristiesInc/status/1392282036417728519">just under $17 million</a> in a Christie&#8217;s auction Tuesday evening, marking another substantial moment for NFT art sales. The lot of pixelated portraits were from the collection of the NFT platform&#8217;s co-creators Matt Hall and John Watkinson.</p>
<p>The CryptoPunks platform is one of the first NFT projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Back in 2017, ten thousand of the procedurally generated characters were given away for free. In the years since, a vibrant NFT community has developed around the &#8216;Punks. In recent months, on the back of a broader NFT boom, prices exploded.</p>
<p>Last month, TechCrunch profiled the community and some of its buyers who have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars each to join the exclusive club of CryptoPunks owners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Tuesday&#8217;s sale marks a substantial payday for the creators of the project, but comes just days after a much more substantial one: the release of their new project called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/cryptopunks-maker-larva-labs-launches-their-new-nft-project-meebits/">Meebits</a> which garnered nearly $80 million in sales in just a few hours.</p>
<p>The final Christie&#8217;s bid was for $14.5 million, $16.96 million after fees.</p>
<p>Many inside the crypto community had expected the sale to reach an even higher premium in recent weeks, something that had led to a substantial run-up in prices of CryptoPunks in the weeks ahead of the auction. Though the lot sold for a significantly higher dollar amount, when priced in denominations of the surging Ethereum cryptocurrency, the entire bundle sold for slightly less than the sale price of the last alien figure, which sold in March for 4,200 Eth (some $7.2M USD at the time).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Charity Dean has been in the national spotlight lately because she was among a group of doctors, scientists and tech entrepreneurs who sounded the pandemic alarm early last year and who are featured in a new book by Michael Lewis about the U.S. response, called <em><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393881554">The Premonition</a></em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder the press &#8212; and, seemingly <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/michael-lewis-the-premonition-universal-pandemic-movie-phil-lord-christopher-miller-direct-amy-pascal-1234753413/">moviemakers, too</a> &#8212; are interested in Dean. Surgery is her first love, but she also studied tropical diseases and not only applied what she knows about outbreaks on the front lines last year, but also came to appreciate an opportunity that only someone in her position could see. Indeed, after the pandemic laid bare just how few tools were available to help the U.S. government to track how the virus was moving and mutating, she helped develop a model that has since been turned into subscription software to (hopefully) prevent, detect, and contain costly disease outbreaks in the future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tech that companies with global operations might want to understand better. It has also attracted $8 million in seed funding Venrock, Alphabet&#8217;s Verily unit, and Sweat Equity Ventures. We talked late last week with Dean about her now 20-person outfit, called <a href="https://www.thepublichealthco.com/">The Public Health Company</a>, and why she thinks disease-focused risk management will be as crucial for companies going forward as cybersecurity software. Our chat has been edited for length; you can also listen to our longer conversation <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/two-different-founders-novel-ideas-fresh-seed-funding/id1498270180?i=1000520826971">here</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You went to medical school but you also have a master&#8217;s degree in public health and tropical medicine. Why was the latter an area of interest for you? </strong></p>
<p>CD: Neither of my parents had college degrees. I grew up in a very modest setting in rural Oregon. We were poor and by the grace of a full ride scholarship to college I got to be premed. When I was a little girl some missionaries came to our church and talked about disease outbreaks in Africa. I was seven years old, and driving home that evening with my parents, I said, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to be a doctor, and I&#8217;m going to study disease.&#8217;  It was outrageous because I didn&#8217;t know a single person with a college degree. But . .  my heart was set on that, and it never deviated from it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did you wind up at the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department, instead of in private practice?</strong></p>
<p>CD: It&#8217;s funny, when I was finishing up my residency &#8212; which I started doing general surgery, then I pivoted into internal medicine &#8212;  I had a number of different doctors&#8217; private practices come to me and try to recruit me because of the shortage of women physicians.</p>
<p>[At the same time] the medical director from the county public health department came and found me and he said, &#8216;Hey, I hear you have a master&#8217;s in tropical medicine.&#8217; And he said, &#8216;Would you consider coming to work as the deputy health officer, and communicable disease controller, and tuberculosis controller, and [oversee the] HIV clinic and homeless clinic?&#8217; And . . . it was, for me, a fairly easy choice.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Because there was so little attention being paid to all of these other issues?</strong></p>
<p>CD: What caught my attention is when he said communicable disease controller and tuberculosis controller. I had lived in Africa [for a time] and learned a lot about HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, vaccine-preventable diseases &#8212; things you don&#8217;t see in the United States. [And the job] was so in lockstep with who I was because it&#8217;s the safety net. [These afflicted individuals] don&#8217;t have health insurance. Many are undocumented. Many have nowhere else to go for health care, and the county clinic truly serves the communities that I cared about, and that&#8217;s where I wanted to be.</p>
<p><strong>TC: In that role &#8212; and later at the California Department of Public Health &#8212; you developed expertise in multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Was your understanding of how it is transmitted &#8212; and how the symptoms present differently &#8212; what made you attuned to what was headed for the U.S. early last year?</strong></p>
<p>CD: It was probably the single biggest contributor to my thinking. When we have a novel pathogen as a doctor, or as a communicable disease controller, our minds think in terms of buckets of pathogen: some are airborne, some are spread on surfaces, some are spread through fecal material or through water. In January [of last year],  as I was watching the news reports emerge out of China, it became clear to me that this was potentially a perfect pathogen. What does that mean? It would mean it had some of the attributes of things like tuberculosis or measles or influenza &#8212; that it had the ability to spread from person to person, likely through the air, that it made people sick enough that China was standing up hospitals in two weeks, and that it moved fast enough through the population to grow exponentially.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You are credited with helping to convince California Governor Gavin Newsom to issue lock-down orders when he did.</strong></p>
<p>CD: Everything I&#8217;ve done is as part of a team. In March, some amazing heroes parachuted in from the private sector, including [former U.S Chief Technology Officer] Todd Park, [famed data scientist] DJ Patil, [and Venrock&#8217;s] Bob Kocher, to help the state of California develop a modeling effort that would actually show, through computer-generated models, in what direction the pandemic was headed.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did those efforts and thinking lead you to form The Public Health Company last August?</strong></p>
<p>CD: What we are doing at The Public Health Company is incorporating the genomic variant analysis &#8212; or the fingerprint of the virus of COVID virus as it mutates and as it moves through a population &#8212;  with epidemiology investigations and [porting these with] the kind of traditional data you might have from a local public health officer into a platform to make those tools readily available and easy to use to inform decision makers. You don&#8217;t have to have a mathematician and a data scientist and an infectious disease doctor standing next to you to make a decision; we make those tools automated and readily available.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who are your customers? The U.S. government? Foreign governments?</strong></p>
<p>CD: Are the tools that we are developing useful for government? Absolutely. We&#8217;re engaged in a number of different partnerships where this is of incredible service to governments. But they are as useful, if not even more useful, to the private sector because they haven&#8217;t had these tools. They don&#8217;t have a disease control capability at their fingertips and many of them have had to essentially stand up their own internal public health department, and figure it out on the fly, and the feedback that we&#8217;re seeing from private sector businesses has been incredible.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I could see hedge funds and insurance companies gravitating quickly to this. What are some customers or types of customers that might surprise readers?</strong></p>
<p>CD: One bucket that might not occur to people is in the risk management space of a large enterprise that has global operations like a warehouse or a factory in different places. The risk management of COVID-19 is going to look very different in each one of those locations based on: how the virus is mutating in that location, the demographics of their employees, the type of activities they&#8217;re doing, [and] the ventilation system in their facility. Trying to grapple with all of those different factors . . .is something that we can do for them through a combination of our tech-enabled service, the expertise we have, the modeling, and the genetic analysis.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know that risk management in terms of disease control has been a big part of private sector conversations, [but] we think of it similar to cyber security in that after a number of high-profile cyber security attacks, it became clear to every insurance agency or private sector business that risk management had to include cyber security they had to stand up. We very much believe that disease control in risk management for continuity of operations is going to be incredibly important moving forward in a way that I couldn&#8217;t have explained  before COVID. They see it now and they understand it&#8217;s an existential threat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you ever bought power banks, water bottles, toys, or other daily goods on Amazon, the chances are your suppliers are from China. Analysts have estimated that the share of Chinese merchants represented <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/75-of-new-sellers-on-amazon-are-from-china">75% of Amazon&#8217;s new sellers</a> in January, up from 47% the year before, according to Marketplace Pulse, an e-commerce research firm.</p>
<p>Chinese sellers are swarming not just Amazon but also eBay, Wish, Shopee and Alibaba&#8217;s AliExpress. The boom is in part a result of intense domestic competition in China&#8217;s online retail world, which forces merchants to seek new markets. Traditional exporters are turning to e-commerce, cutting out excessive distributors. Businesses are enchanted by the tale that a swathe of the priciest property in Shenzhen, an expensive city known for its tech and manufacturing, is now owned by people who made a fortune from e-commerce export.</p>
<p>But the get-rich-quick optimism among the cross-border community came to a halt when several top Chinese sellers disappeared from Amazon over the past few days. At least eleven accounts that originate from Greater China were suspended, according to Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of Marketplace Pulse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Several accounts belong to the same parent firms, as it&#8217;s normal for big sellers, those with more than a million dollars in annual sales, to operate multiple brands on Amazon to optimize sales.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Mpower and Aukey, whose Amazon stores are gone and were two of the most successful brands native to the American marketplace.</p>
<p>In total, the suspended accounts contribute over a billion dollars in gross merchandise value (GMV) to Amazon, said Kaziukenas.</p>
<p>Amazon didn&#8217;t comment on the status of the suspended accounts, but said in a statement for TechCrunch that it has &#8220;long-standing policies to protect the integrity of our store, including product authenticity, genuine reviews, and products meeting the expectations of our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We take swift action against those that violate them, including suspending or removing selling privileges,&#8221; said an Amazon spokesperson.</p>
<p>Chinese e-commerce exporters were startled by the incident. Inside WeChat groups where hundreds of sellers normally exchange business strategies, anxiety is rife and the consensus is that the targeted sellers have &#8220;crossed the line&#8221; in conducting questionable platform practices. Amazon says it shares enforcement actions directly with selling accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t the first time Amazon has shut down accounts over fake reviews and other behavior that violate its rules, but the scale of this wave is unprecedented,&#8221; said Bill Zhang, who develops and exports smart training suits through Amazon.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no doubt that Amazon needs Chinese suppliers for affordable and diverse products, of which average quality has also increased remarkably in recent years. But as competition heated up among Chinese sellers, black hat tactics that were common in Chinese e-commerce became a necessity to survive on Amazon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an open secret that a lot of Chinese sellers are aggressive towards marketing,&#8221; Cameron Walker, who worked for an export trade show in China for over a decade before running a toy export business.</p>
<p>One of the common tricks employed by Chinese sellers is manipulating reviews, which affect how a product is listed on Amazon. This can be done by paying real buyers to leave a positive review or sending fake orders and leaving good comments through zombie accounts.</p>
<p>The latter approach is often delegated to agents that call themselves &#8220;product review&#8221; services, which offer a suite of resources to emulate real accounts: IP proxies, virtual credit cards, overseas addresses, any pieces of identity that can help avoid suspicion from Amazon&#8217;s fraud detection algorithms, said an executive at a payments service who works closely with Chinese exporters.</p>
<p>Another prevalent tactic, which perhaps poses a greater existential crisis to Amazon than fake reviews, is ways to direct buyers away from Amazon onto merchants&#8217; own web stores. Amazon restricts merchants from collecting sensitive buyer information such as emails, but Chinese exporters find a way around: sending postcards to customers and asking them to leave reviews on their own websites.</p>
<p>These tricks have been around for years; what caused the sudden attack at top sellers?</p>
<p>Five exporters contacted by TechCrunch pointed to a <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/blog/amazon-reviews-leak-report/">data breach</a> uncovered by SafetyDetectives, a cybersecurity firm, which contained a trove of direct messages between Amazon sellers soliciting fake reviews from buyers. The data, which implicates more than 200,000 individuals, was hosted on a server that appears to be in China, according to SafetyDetectives.</p>
<p>The report didn&#8217;t mention the names of the sellers involved. TechCrunch cannot immediately verify claims in the report.</p>
<p>Amazon did not say whether it was aware of the data breach. It, however, assured that it uses &#8220;machine learning tools and skilled investigators to analyze over 10 million review submissions weekly&#8221; and monitor &#8220;all existing reviews for signs of abuse and quickly take action if we find an issue.&#8221; It also works with social media sites to report &#8220;bad actors who are cultivating abusive reviews outside our store.&#8221;</p>
<p>But bad actors will likely come back even after the latest episodes of crackdowns, said the cross-border payments executive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon is fighting an entire lucrative and tight-knit ecosystem of merchants and fake review services, not just a few big sellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent years, Amazon has been nudging more new sellers to join and be &#8220;good brands,&#8221; observed Walker. Merchants now need to meet strict requirements for brand registries, safety testing, and insurance liability, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting more difficult and costly to run a business on Amazon.&#8221;</p>
<p>These challenges have encouraged hordes of exporters to diversify sales channels beyond Amazon and invest in their own Shopify-based web stores, where they get to write the rules. They are encouraged by what Shein, an independent e-commerce store that sells made-in-China apparel to overseas markets, has achieved. In the first quarter, Shein was the world&#8217;s second most downloaded shopping app, according to data provided by app analytics firm SensorTower. Many Chinese sellers dream that one day they, too, could break free from the grip of a behemoth like Amazon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seeing someone mention their pronouns in their Instagram bio has become commonplace — so much so that the app now has a dedicated location where users can put pronouns without taking up that valuable profile space.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1392176784028749824">announced the new feature on Twitter</a>, saying that it is only available in a few countries just now, but will be arriving in more soon. I was able to make it work here in the U.S. in version 187 of the iOS app.</p>
<p>To set your pronoun, just go to your profile page, hit &#8220;Edit Profile,&#8221; then look in the list of items for an empty Pronouns field (this is different from the one deeper in &#8220;personal information settings). Tap that and you can pick what you prefer to be called by — up to four items.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interestingly, the feature does not allow users to just type in whatever they want — presumably so the field is used for its intended purpose and not for gender-related &#8220;jokes.&#8221; I was able to find most of the pronouns on <a href="https://lgbtqia.ucdavis.edu/educated/pronouns">this list</a>, and my guess is Instagram will add more if people ask. (I&#8217;ve contacted the company asking for more information.)</p>
<p>Whatever you choose will appear next to your name a slightly darker type — there&#8217;s also the option to show this only to followers, in case a person&#8217;s gender isn&#8217;t something they want to share publicly. Of course if you want to freeform it or use some emoji or fancy font, you can skip the &#8220;official&#8221; pronouns and do that instead.</p>
<p>Not everyone feels the need to share or specify their gender, but the practice has become so widespread that Instagram made a smart choice in making it an integrated part of the profile. It both saves space (now you can put &#8220;Doom metal fiend&#8221; and &#8220;Proud mom&#8221; on two lines) and endorses gender identity as something at least as important as links and other bio info.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While much of the world eagerly watches to see if the vaccination rollout helps curb and eventually stamp out Covid-19, one of the companies that has been helping to manage the spread of the virus is announcing a big round of funding on the heels for strong demand for its technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://huma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huma</a>, which combines data from biomarkers with predictive algorithms both to help monitor patients, and uses the same technology to help researchers and pharmaceutical companies run clinical trials, has closed funding of $130 million, a Series C that includes $100 million in equity, and $30 million in credit. The company can also extend this to $200 million by way of an extra $70 million in equity if it chooses.</p>
<p>Huma can pick up data that patients contribute via smartphones, or by way of diagnostic devices that measure glucose, blood pressure or oxygen saturation, and the plan will be to use the funding to augment that in a couple of ways: to continue investing in R&amp;D to both expand the kinds of biomarkers that Huma can measure and to work on more research and trials; to continue expanding London-based Huma&#8217;s business particularly in newer geographies like the US, alongside a strong wave of business it&#8217;s been seeing in Europe, specifically the UK and the DACH region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding includes a number of high-profile strategic and financial backers that speak to some of the opportunities coming down the pike. Co-led by Leaps by Bayer, the VC division of the pharmaceutical and life sciences giant, and Hitachi Ventures, it also includes Samsung Next, Sony Innovation Fund by IGV (one of Sony&#8217;s investment funds), Unilever Ventures and HAT Technology &amp; Innovation Fund, Nikesh Arora (the former president of SoftBank and ex-Google exec) and Michael Diekmann (Chairman of Allianz) all in the round. Bayer also led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/medopad-raises-25m-led-by-bayer-to-develop-biomarkers-tracked-via-apps-and-wearables/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huma&#8217;s $25 million Series B in 2019</a>, when the startup was still called Medopad.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/medopad-rebrands-as-huma-acquires-biobeats-and-tlt-to-expand-its-biomarker-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medopad rebranded to Huma last year in April</a>, just as the Covid-19 pandemic was really taking hold across the world. In the year since, CEO and founder Dan Vahdat said that the company has been on a growth tear, working hard across the spectrum of areas where its technology could prove useful, since it provides a bridge to monitoring patients remotely, at a time when it&#8217;s been significantly more challenging to see people in person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year when the pandemic first hit, it made everyone’s lives miserable not just from the health aspect but also research aspect,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The whole idea is how to decentralize care and research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its work has included partnering with the NHS early on to ship some 1 million oxygen saturation devices to monitor how patients&#8217; levels were faring, since that was early on discovered to be a leading indicator of whether a patient would need urgent medical care: this was essential way to triage people remotely at a time when hospitals were quickly getting overwhelmed with people. Vahdat said this directly helped reduce readmissions by one-third.</p>
<p>It is also playing a role in helping to monitor all the many patients who had been due to have operations but found those postponed. In the UK alone, there were 4.8 million people waiting as a result for their procedures, &#8220;a shocking number,&#8221; Vahdat said. How to handle that queue? The idea here, he said, is that when you are a patient at home waiting for cardiac surgery, your condition might deteriorate quickly. Or it may not. Huma set up a system to provide diagnostics for those patients to monitor how they were doing: signs that they were not doing well meant they would get moved up and brought in to be seen by a specialist before they deteriorated and became urgent rather than managed cases.</p>
<p>Alongside this clinical work, Huma has also been working on a number of trials and research, including a phase 4 study on one of the Covid-19 vaccines that has been getting distributed under emergency authorization (this is a regulatory process that comes in the wake of that authorization).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also been continuing to contribute essential data to ongoing medical research. One that the company can disclose that is not directly related to Covid-19 is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bayer-clinical-trials-collaborate-road-digitalization-moeller-md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heart study for Bayer</a>; and one that is related to Covid-19 &#8212; finding better biomarkers (specifically in looking at digital phenotypes) to detect Covid-19 infections earlier &#8212; called the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/university-of-cambridge-researchers-and-huma-begin-in-depth-study-of-early-detection-of-covid-19-infection-875563042.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cambridge Fenland study</a>.</p>
<p>This long list of work has meant that Huma still has much of its Series B in the bank, and so it&#8217;s also been turning its attention to humanitarian work, donating resources to India and other countries still in the throes of their own Covid-19 crises.</p>
<p>Although startups that bridge the worlds of medicine and technology can be very long plays, the last year has shown not just how vital it is to invest in the smartest of these to see out their ambitions for the greater good of all of us, but that, when they do have their breakthroughs, it can prove to be a huge thing for the companies and investors. BioNTech&#8217;s last year has been nothing short of a stratospheric turnaround, going from a loss-making business to one producing more than $1 billion in profit in the last quarter on the back of its Covid-19 vaccine research and work with Pfizer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for that reason that so many investors are keen to continue supporting the likes of Huma and the insights it provides.</p>
<p>“Aligned with the vision of Leaps by Bayer, Huma’s expertise and technology will help drive a global paradigm shift towards prevention and care and may boost research efforts using data and digital technology,&#8221; said Juergen Eckhardt, Head of Leaps by Bayer, in a statement. &#8220;We invest into the most disruptive technologies of our time that have the potential to change the world for the better. As an early investor into Huma we know how perfectly the company fits into that frame as one of the leading digital innovators in healthcare and life sciences.”</p>
<p>“Huma has built a comprehensive remote patient monitoring platform and established a strong track-record and we are excited to be working with Huma to bring its world-leading health technology to new markets in Asia. We believe that together we can advance new digital health products to power better care and research for all,&#8221; added Keiji Kojima, EVP of Hitachi’s Smart Life division.</p>
<p><em>Updated with a correction on the funding, specifically how the amount splits between equity and credit.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SaaS-maker <a href="https://www.birdie.care">Birdie</a> has closed an $11.5 million Series A round of funding led by Index Ventures. Existing investor Kamet Ventures also participated.</p>
<p>The UK-based caretech startup has raised a total of $22.9M since being founded back in 2017 (a 2018 raise that was called a Series A at the time is now being classed as a seed expansion). It&#8217;s focused on building tools for social care providers to drive efficiencies in a chronically under resourced sector.</p>
<p>Birdie isn&#8217;t a care provider itself (so it&#8217;s not a direct competitor to a startup like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/social-care-startup-lifted-raises-1-5m-for-end-to-end-elderly-care-platform/">Lifted</a>); rather it aims to support care providers with a suite of digital tools intended to reduce admin costs and makes it easier to manage the care being provided to individuals &#8212; doing away with the need for paper-based records, and enabling real-time visibility such as via carer check-ins and medication-related notifications.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The wider mission is for the platform to support care providers to offer more co-ordinated, personalized and &#8212; the hope is &#8212; preventative care so that older adults can be supported to live for longer in their own homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology can completely transform the way we look after the elderly and help them to age at home much longer, healthier and happier,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Max Parmentier, explaining the founding premise. &#8220;We position ourselves as a solution to uniquely offer a full support for the elderly to age at home&#8230; So we started off with the people closest to the elderly and caring for the elderly which are the care providers. And when we look at how these providers are operating they are extraordinary committed, and very much involved in their work, but the care delivered is very uncoordinated, reactive and sometimes very generic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt that we could go way beyond &#8212; in terms of technology &#8212; becoming the operating system to be much more efficient in the way they deliver care but also to significantly increase the quality of the care delivered.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the draw for VCs to invest in such an under-resourced market? &#8220;There&#8217;s macro trends which are unavoidable. I agree with you that it&#8217;s vastly underfunded but it&#8217;s just unsustainable,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;There is clearly an argument to say that whether VCs or investors are interested in this industry or not it&#8217;s going to get bigger. And one way or another we&#8217;ll have to find some funding mechanism to pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today already we hear horrible stories about older people not being taken care of properly. I think what got particular Index excited is really the opportunity to [tell a positive story],&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite an optimistic person. I do believe that actually you could very much craft a much happier path in terms of ageing which is actually more affordable &#8212; because it doesn&#8217;t cost as much because you really lower the healthcare costs if you really tailor these packages better and tailor the care much better. And you can also use technology to make it more personalized, more preventative.&#8221;</p>
<p>By simplifying and streamlining data capture around elderly care via a digital platform, information about the care being delivered can be structured in a way that helps reduce errors (such as from handwritten notes leading to administering the wrong medication) and allows for problems to be spotted early when an intervention may be highly beneficial, is the contention.</p>
<p>Parmentier gives the example of early signs of a urinary tract infection which, if picked up on &#8212; by spotting telltale signs in the data &#8212; can be treated simply at home with antibiotics. But if not an elderly person may end up in hospital, with all the associated risks of a far worse outcome.</p>
<p>Birdie can also supply connected hardware like motion sensors to its care provider customers so that its platform can monitor frail elderly adults who may be at risk of falling. Although Parmentier emphasizes that such hardware is an optional component of the platform &#8212; and is only installed with the full knowledge and consent of the care recipient.</p>
<p>The business is focused on &#8220;serving the interests and the rights of these older adults and no one else&#8221;, he says, confirming that care recipients&#8217; data is not shared with any third parties unless it&#8217;s directly related to the delivery of their care.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149931" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149931" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2149931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kymono�Birdie�Gabellini-Fava-46.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="317" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kymono�Birdie�Gabellini-Fava-46.jpg 5200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kymono�Birdie�Gabellini-Fava-46.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kymono�Birdie�Gabellini-Fava-46.jpg?resize=300,140 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kymono�Birdie�Gabellini-Fava-46.jpg?resize=768,358 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kymono�Birdie�Gabellini-Fava-46.jpg?resize=680,317 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kymono�Birdie�Gabellini-Fava-46.jpg?resize=1536,717 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kymono�Birdie�Gabellini-Fava-46.jpg?resize=2048,955 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kymono�Birdie�Gabellini-Fava-46.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149931" class="wp-caption-text">Birdie&#8217;s team (Image credits: Birdie)</p></div></p>
<p>Having a digital platform-level view into an individual&#8217;s care obviously offers increased visibility vs paper-based records. It also means real-time data can be shared &#8212; such as with close family members who may want the reassurance of knowing when their loved one has received a visit or taken their medication, and so on. (Again, though, only with the proper consents.)</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a positive narrative which is that ageing is actually great,&#8221; Parmentier suggests. &#8220;If you&#8217;re in good health this part of your life is probably one of the most exciting. And this is really the spin we should give in terms of story but also we should empower these older adults with the right support to take that happy path.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, Birdie has partnered with almost 500 providers across the U.K. &#8212; and currently its platform is being used to support the care of more than 20,000 older people every week.</p>
<p>Growth has been 8x over the past 12 months, per Parmentier, as the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated demand for in-home elderly care. The new funding will go on accelerating growth in the U.K., though he also says it has its eye on other geographies and sees potential to expand internationally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phase one [of the business] is how can we empower these care providers to be better at what they do?&#8221; he says. &#8220;Because I really believe that there&#8217;s am army of care givers who are so committed and if we can help them be better at what they do that&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Having structured data on elderly care provides a foundation for conducting research that could further the &#8216;preventative&#8217; care component of the mission &#8212; and Birdie is taking some tentative steps in that direction via some project partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Such as <a href="https://www.birdie.care/blog/birdie-faculty-polypharmacy">one into polypharmacy</a> (i.e. concurrent use of medications which can have negative clinical consequences) with U.K.-based AI company Faculty.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s very little known as to what impact medication has on older adults health. If you think about it we just have pharma companies doing trials and then flagging secondary symptoms up when they arise and then doctors prescribe that. The reality is for elderly people &#8212; because usually they combine different medications &#8212; the symptoms and the damage to health can be greater,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve done with Faculty is to look at what is the medication treatment of an older adult and what is the clinical observations from carers following these medication treatments. So do we see that typically there&#8217;s less appetite to eat or drink, or complaints about pains and so on. And do we see correlations with the actual medication treatment prescribed?&#8221;</p>
<p>The polypharmacy research is at an early stage but he says the hope is they will be able to build an AI model that can generate warnings for a prescribing clinician if a particular medication regime has been linked to outcomes that may damage health or otherwise hamper healthy caring for an individual.</p>
<p>On the research side, Birdie&#8217;s website notes that it&#8217;s using &#8220;anonymized&#8221; data in these exploratory efforts &#8212; which is a claim that merits scrutiny given that medical data is both very sensitive and notoriously difficult to robustly (irreversibly) anonymize.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Asked about this, Parmentier says that for the moment its research efforts entail correlating data on different older adults from different care providers, and that the data being pooled is limited to specifically relevant info (i.e. depending on the research project) &#8212; removing &#8220;all the un-needed data&#8221;, as he puts it. </span></p>
<p>He says it is not, for example, currently combining any of the data it holds with National Health Service (NHS) patient data &#8212; which he acknowledges could pose a major risk of re-identification. But he also says Birdie does want to go there because it believes that combining more data-sets could help it further preventative care research.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk is when you pool your data with any third party data-set such as the NHS for instance. That is really risky&#8230; because there&#8217;s always a way to tie it back. So we&#8217;ve been keeping away from that for the moment,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it can really improve our preventative models but we need to do that only under very strict conditions that the anonymization is bullet-proof,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t done that yet and we&#8217;re exploring ways to do it. But we&#8217;re going to very cautious about it. So for the moment there&#8217;s no risk really because we&#8217;re not mixing data-sets of the same patient. But if we were to integrate with third parties&#8217; systems the risk will rise &#8212; and we&#8217;ll need to address it very clearly.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Parmentier also offers</span> a glimpse of an ambitious potential second phase of the business &#8212; where Birdie believes it will be able to coach older adults themselves (and/or their family members who are acting as care givers), i.e. enabled by its platform-level view of best practice (and by being able to fold in data-fuelled research into preventative care AI models).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">To get there will require not just a lot of data but a sectoral shift toward a model of care delivery focused on &#8220;value-based healthcare&#8221;; where the provider is billed not for hours of care given but on health/quality of life outcomes. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So the transformative vision of highly scalable, data-enabled elderly home care is certainly not going to arrive overnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the meanwhile Birdie&#8217;s business remains firmly in phase one: Building support tools to drive efficiency and quality for an under-resourced sector.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We see the same problem everywhere,&#8221; adds Parmentier. &#8220;Today already we don&#8217;t look after our elderly properly&#8230; Today they cost us about 60% of our healthcare costs. Tomorrow is going to be much worse. We need to channel more investment into this industry &#8212; in terms of new ways of operating, technology, and really innovation is key to move towards better models where it&#8217;s more preventative, more personalized, more outcome based &#8212; because that&#8217;s the solution. It&#8217;s going to lower the cost base, it&#8217;s going to improve the health outcomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Stephane Kurgan, venture partner at Index Ventures, added: &#8220;Our ageing society and increasing healthcare costs require us to rethink the way we care for frailer populations like the elderly. Technology gives us the tools, as the care sector has remained widely paper-based and is ripe for disruption.</p>
<p>“By investing in caretech with Birdie, we are investing in solving the daily challenges of the care community. We firmly believe in Birdie’s vision to make care more personalised and more preventative so that older people can age at home longer, healthier and happier. We’ve been impressed by Birdie’s traction and the calibre of its team, and are very excited to embark on this journey with them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://panaseer.com/">Panaseer</a>, which takes a data science approach to cybersecurity, has raised $26.5 million in a Series B funding led by <a href="https://allegiscyber.com/">AllegisCyber Capital</a>. Existing investors, including Evolution Equity Partners, Notion Capital, AlbionVC, Cisco Investments and Paladin Capital Group, as well as new investor National Grid Partners, also participated. Panaseer has now raised $43 million to date.</p>
<p>Panaseer’s special sauce and sales pitch amount to what it calls &#8220;Continuous Controls Monitoring&#8221; (CCM). In plainer English that means correlating a great deal of data from all available security tools to check assets, control gaps, you name it.</p>
<p>As a result, the company says it can identify zero-day and other exposures faster, or exposure to, say, FireEye or SolarWinds vulnerabilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jonathan Gill, CEO, Panaseer said: &#8220;Most enterprises have the tools and capability to theoretically prevent a breach from occurring. However, one of the key reasons that breaches occur is that there is no technology to monitor and react to failed controls. CCM continuously validates and measures levels of protection and provides notifications of failures. Ultimately, CCM enables these failures to be fixed before they become security incidents.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me on a call he added: “The investment, allows us to scale our organization to meet those demands of customers with a team of people to implement the platform and help them get tremendous value and to evolve the product. To add more and more capability to that technology to support more and more use cases. So they&#8217;re the two main directions, and there&#8217;s a market we think of tens of thousands of organizations of a certain size, who are regulated or they have assets worth protecting and a level of complexity that makes it difficult to solve the problem themselves. And our Advisory Board and the customers I&#8217;ve spoken with think maybe there are barely 20 companies in the world who can solve this problem. And everybody else gets stuck on the fact that it&#8217;s a really difficult data science problem to solve. So we want to scale that and take that to more organizations.&#8221;</p>

<p>And why did they pick these investors: &#8220;I think we picked them and they picked us, we&#8217;ve been on that journey together. It takes months to find the best combination. The dollars are all the same when it comes to investors, but I think they can help improve as an organization and grow just like the existing investors do. They give us access and reach into parts of the market and help make us better as organizations as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob Ackerman, founder and managing director of AllegisCyber Capital, and co-founder of DataTribe said: &#8220;The emergence of Continuous Controls Monitoring as a new cybersecurity category demonstrates a &#8216;coming of age&#8217; for cybersecurity. Cyber is the existential threat to the global digital economy. All levels of the enterprise, from the CISO, to Chief Risk Officer, to the Board of Directors are demanding comprehensive visibility, transparency and hard metrics to assess cyber situational awareness.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After months of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/fcc-proposes-rules-for-emergency-broadband-program-to-keep-struggling-families-online/">deliberations</a>, the FCC is ready to start helping people cover the cost of broadband and connected devices through two emergency funds amounting to more than $10 billion. If your household has trouble paying for internet access or shares a single computer, or your wallet has just had a rough year, you probably qualify for help.</p>
<p>The two distinct programs are the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program and the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit">Emergency Broadband Benefit Program</a>. They sound similar, and in a general sense they do similar things, but they&#8217;re distinct programs intended to help close the connectivity gap in America, especially for those most adversely affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>The first, which we&#8217;ll just call the Connectivity Fund, is not something you as an ordinary consumer necessarily need to worry about, but your household may still benefit from it. It&#8217;s intended, as FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has explained, to close the &#8220;homework gap&#8221; specifically, meaning kids who lack the ability to take part in online schoolwork because they lack a suitable device or connection.</p>
<p>The fund will work with schools and libraries to cover the cost of things like portable Wi-Fi hot spots, tablets, laptops or other connectivity-related items. Basically, those institutions will do their own work to identify the kids and families that need help, provide what they think is needed and then send the bill to the FCC.</p>
<p>As a parent, you may have to respond to a survey or talk to your kid&#8217;s teacher about what would help most, but you probably won&#8217;t have to do much in the way of paperwork. That said, you might ask an administrator whether they&#8217;re aware of and participating in the program — it goes through the FCC&#8217;s E-rate program, which might be a more familiar term to them.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ISpNWNPPQ4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/">The FCC has a new acting chairwoman in Jessica Rosenworcel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The FCC has a new acting chairwoman in Jessica Rosenworcel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/embed/#?secret=ISpNWNPPQ4" data-secret="ISpNWNPPQ4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Emergency Broadband Benefit is the one that ordinary users will need to do a little legwork to take advantage of. This $3 billion fund is a one-time thing, available only while the money lasts, and the FCC in a call with media wasn&#8217;t really able to estimate exactly how long that is likely to be, as it depends on how many people sign up in the first place.</p>
<p>The program subsidizes $50 (or $75 in tribal lands) in broadband costs and provides a one-time $100 discount for hardware, provided you<a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/do-i-qualify/"> meet the eligibility requirements</a>. The short version is if you qualify for any other federal assistance, like Pell grants, free and reduced-price lunch, Medicaid, etc., you almost certainly qualify here. And if you earn less than $99K and &#8220;experienced a substantial loss of income&#8221; in the last year, you also qualify — which covers a whole lot more people.</p>
<p><a href="https://getemergencybroadband.org/how-to-apply/">You can apply online or via mail</a> starting tomorrow, May 12, but the easiest thing to do might be to check if your current broadband provider is participating and just ask them to enroll you in the program. They may have their own form you have to fill out, but the result is $50 off your internet for as long as there&#8217;s money in the FCC&#8217;s $3 billion bag.</p>
<p>When I asked an FCC representative whether the two programs could complement or interfere with one another in a single household, they said there will probably be some limitations but that specifics will come later. Basically there are provisions to prevent a single internet connection or device from receiving discounts from both programs, but because they&#8217;re administered differently you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about that. Just ask the school what they&#8217;ve got for you and sign up for the broadband benefit, and you should be good. (Likewise for Lifeline and other benefits — should be fine.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, the two measures were both passed unanimously by the FCC, and the comments of the individual commissioners show that they are pleased to get this out the door — this really is a $10 billion giveaway to those who need it most, and though it took some time to achieve, it should be helpful to quite a lot of people.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Daily Crunch. You look great today!</p>
<p>From our perch, it’s fascinating to watch the exit market for startups wax and wane this year. And change it has. After kicking off with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/welcome-to-bloxburg-public-investors/">blistering pace in early 2021</a> before succumbing to what felt like a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">sudden cold snap</a>, it appears that the public markets are once again welcoming startups to their rosters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At least that’s what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/digging-into-digital-mortgage-lender-better-coms-huge-spac/">venture-backed digital mortgage unicorn <strong>Better.com</strong> hopes</a>. And media companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/understanding-the-media-company-spac-push/"><strong>BuzzFeed</strong>, <strong>Vice</strong>, and the artist formerly known as <strong>Bustle</strong></a>. Tech stocks might be losing ground, but the demand for unicorn liquidity appears to be winning out over caution. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/final-mile-fulfillment-startup-parcellab-closes-112m-series-c-funding-led-by-insight-partners/">$112M for last-mile fulfillment</a>:</strong> Munich-based <strong>parcelLab</strong> just closed a mega-round to make delivery and returns better for e-commerce companies.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/acquco-raises-160m/"><strong>$160M to buy third-party retailers on Amazon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Yet another startup has raised a huge amount of money to buy up retailers that sell on other sites. <strong>Acquco</strong> joins <strong>Thrasio</strong> and <strong>Perch</strong> in the game with oodles of capital.</li>
<li>The American scooter wars have died down to a murmur, but that doesn’t mean that shared-transit startups around the world aren’t still competing for market share. <a href="https://twitter.com/ulonnaya">Tage Kene-Okafor</a> reports for TechCrunch on “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/"><strong>the motorcycle ride-hailing wars in Nigeria and Uganda</strong></a>.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>The world of startups has become so very broad that it’s a bit bonkers to try and cut down on the total news volume each day for this newsletter. So what follows is a sampling of what we published today concerning the upstart economy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/why-transunion-led-blockchain-fintech-spring-labs-30m-series-b/">Why TransUnion led blockchain fintech Spring Labs’ $30M Series B</a>:</strong> Credit ratings as they exist today are garbage. Perhaps the blockchain will be better? TransUnion also would like to avoid being replaced, so it has its checkbook out for <strong>Spring Labs</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/sequoia-games-looks-to-capitalize-nba-top-shot-fever-with-their-own-ar-tabletop-game/"><strong>Sequoia Games looks to capitalize on NBA Top Shot fever with an AR tabletop game</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Concerned that NFTs were too cool? This is “a game that seems to be trading cards meets Catan meets NFTs meets augmented reality,” we wrote. I mean, sure?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-last-gameboard-raises-4m-to-ship-its-digital-tabletop-gaming-platform/">The Last Gameboard raises $4M to ship its digital tabletop gaming platform</a>:</strong> Sticking to the gaming theme, how about a 16-inch square screen that sits flat on your table for all your IRL gaming needs? Let’s just hope it works. Our hopes are up.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/sightcall-raises-42m-for-its-ar-based-visual-assistance-platform/"><strong>SightCall raises $42M for its AR-based visual assistance platform</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Go to a site to make a repair. Hold up a tablet in front of the broken thing. AR-powered interface shows you notes and details about what needs fixing. That’s cool as hell, provided that <strong>SightCall</strong> can get it all to work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/lili-a-neobank-aimed-at-freelancers-raises-55m-as-it-passes-200k-users/">Lili, a neobank aimed at freelancers, raises $55M as it passes 200K users</a>: </strong>No matter how much money global neobanks raise as a startup cohort, they will need several hundred million more. Here’s<strong> Lili</strong> contributing to the cause.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blockchain credit ratings and NFTs and consumer gaming hardware and AR-tech for techs and fintech? It’s a busy startup market out there.</p>
<h2>SaaS companies can grow to $20M+ ARR by selling exclusively to developers</h2>
<p>Before Twilio had a market cap approaching $56 billion and more than 200,000 customers, the cloud-communications platform developed a secret sauce to fuel its growth: a developer-focused model that dispensed with traditional marketing rules.</p>
<p>Software companies that sell directly to end users share a simple framework for managing growth that leverages discoverability, desirability and do-ability (the &#8220;aha!&#8221; moment).</p>
<p>Data show that traditional marketing doesn&#8217;t work on developers; to create and sell software to developers at scale, you&#8217;ll need to toss that B2B playbook and meet customers where they are.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://jamf.com">Jamf</a>, the enterprise Apple device management company, announced that it was acquiring <a href="http://wandera.com">Wandera</a>, a zero trust security startup, for $400 million at the market close today. Today&#8217;s purchase is the largest in the company&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Using a set of management services for Apple devices, Jamf provides IT at large organizations. It is the leader in the market, and snagging Wandera provides a missing modern security layer for the platform.</p>
<p>Jamf CEO Dean Hager says that Wandera&#8217;s zero trust approach fills in an important piece in the Jamf platform tool set. &#8220;The combination of Wandera and Jamf will provide our customers a single source platform that handles deployment, application lifecycle management, policies, filtering and security capabilities across all Apple devices while delivering zero trust network access for all mobile workers,&#8221; Hager said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zero trust, as the name implies, is an approach to security where you don&#8217;t trust anybody regardless of whether they are inside or outside your network. It requires that you force everyone to provide multiple forms of authentication to prove their identity before they can access company resources.</p>
<p>The need for a zero trust approach became even more acute during the pandemic when employees have often been working from home and have needed access to applications and other company resources from wherever they happened to be, a trend that was happening even prior to COVID, and is likely to continue after it ends.</p>

<p>Wandera, which is based in London, was founded in 2012 by brothers Roy and Eldar Tuvey, who had previously co-founded another security startup called ScanSafe. Cisco acquired that company, which helped protect web gateways as a service, for $183 million back in 2009. The brothers raised over $53 million along the way for Wandera. Investors included Bessemer Venture Partners, 83North and Sapphire Ventures.</p>
<p>Sapphire co-founder and managing director Andreas Weiskam had this to say about the company: &#8220;I’ve had the pleasure of working with co-founders (and brothers) Eldar Tuvey and Roy Tuvey for the last several years now and I can honestly say they’re great entrepreneurs and leaders, having built a real company of consequence.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;They’ve created a unique security product which addresses mobile threats by leveraging the increasingly important zero trust network. By joining the Jamf family, the two will help shape the future of the zero trust cloud. And it goes without saying that this is a big win for the customers, especially for those in the Apple ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Jamf is paying Wandera $350 million in cash, then paying them two $25 million payments on October 1, 2021 and December 15, 2021. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, assuming it passes regulatory scrutiny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shortly after Samsung announced that it won’t be attending the upcoming MWC Barcelona, Chinese hardware giant (and Motorola parent) Lenovo has confirmed with TechCrunch that it has also decided to forgo the in-person event. The event is scheduled for June 28 to July 1.</p>
<p>“Lenovo is not attending in person but will participate in the virtual partner program,” the company said in a brief statement. The decision reflects that of Samsung’s &#8212; opting to skip a booth in favor of going all-virtual.</p>
<p>The move is not particularly surprising &#8212; and, as noted earlier, it’s hard to shake the feeling we had early last year, as the dominoes started falling ahead of the event’s cancellation (though by all accounts this year&#8217;s MWC will have a physical presence regardless). Google, IBM, Nokia, Sony, Oracle and Ericsson have all already confirmed they will not be in attendance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Samsung withdraws from in-person MWC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/samsung-withdraws-from-in-person-mwc/embed/#?secret=j9Kl2HftfL" data-secret="j9Kl2HftfL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Some key hardware names are still up on the official MWC exhibitor list, including ZTE, Xiaomi and LG &#8212; though things are further complicated by the fact that the latter recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/lg-is-shutting-down-its-smartphone-business-worldwide/">announced its exit from the smartphone business</a>.</p>
<p>Following Samsung’s announcement, the show’s governing board, the GSMA, told TechCrunch, &#8220;Of course we respect that planning in a pandemic is complicated. Samsung will adapt their presence to virtual for MWC21 and we look forward to seeing them in person 2022.&#8221; It’s safe to assume the response is similar for the moment, though we’ll update if we receive additional comment.</p>
<p>These announcements are, no doubt, a massive blow for MWC’s ambitions for a small return to normalcy this year. But given travel restrictions in many places as the pandemic continues to rage on in various parts of the world, it’s hard to fault any of the companies for their abundance of caution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">eBay is joining the NFT frenzy, telling <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ebay-taps-into-nft-frenzy-allows-sale-platform-2021-05-11/">Reuters</a> today that going forward it will allow the sales of NFTs on its platform, a mainstream embrace that follows billions of dollars in NFT purchases over the past few months. The e-commerce company seems poised to slowly build up sales of digital collectibles on the platform, starting with a smaller group of verified sellers on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the coming months, eBay will add new capabilities that bring blockchain-driven collectibles to our platform,&#8221; eBay exec Jordan Sweetnam told them.</p>
<p>eBay has invested heavily in infrastructure for physical collectibles like trading cards, as well as items like sneakers and watches which they help verify for buyers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>eBay is a major presence in online shopping, but the platform will have its work cut out for it competing with dozens of crypto native NFT marketplaces already out there. While NFT interest has been high as of late, the infrastructure for buying collectibles with cryptocurrencies still isn&#8217;t the most user-friendly. Earlier this week, executives at eBay said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ebay-ceo-says-looking-cryptocurrency-payment-option-cnbc-2021-05-03/">they were open</a> to accepting cryptocurrencies in the future.</p>
<p>This news comes as the Ethereum cryptocurrency, which is the primary method of purchase for most NFTs, reaches past all-time-highs, currently trading over $4,100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck shared more details on the company’s next launch, which is set to take off from its New Zealand facility on May 15. The Electron vehicle will be carrying satellites from BlackSky, but delivering that payload is only half of the mission: the other half will be recovering the booster stage after an ocean splashdown.</p>
<p>This is the second of three planned booster recovery missions, part of Rocket Lab&#8217;s long-term plan to reach reusability for its launch vehicle, an achievement most famously held by its competitor SpaceX. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/rocket-lab-makes-its-first-booster-recovery-after-successful-launch/">The first recovery mission</a>, dubbed “Return to Sender,” successfully splashed down in the Atlantic in November. While Beck told reporters Tuesday the condition of that booster “was remarkable,” this upcoming mission nevertheless features a number of component and system upgrades aimed at further fortifying the booster.</p>
<p>Most notably, the booster will be equipped with a redesigned heat shield made out of stainless steel, rather than aluminum, “designed to carry the reentry loads as well as the ascent loads,” Beck said. Electron must endure temperatures as high as 2400ºC during reentry, conditions the original equipment wasn&#8217;t intended to handle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also introducing what it’s calling the Ocean Recovery and Capture Apparatus, or ORCA, a dedicated system to help lift the rocket stage out of the water and onto the deck of a ship. Rough seas in November presented a challenge to the recovery effort, though ultimately the booster was not damaged.</p>
<p>The mission will also reuse components from the recovered booster, which (although the booster itself was dismantled) were subsequently inspected and requalified for flight. “From here on in, we should be able to reuse this system on every single launch vehicle that we&#8217;ve been bringing back,” Beck said.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab is pursuing a unique route to reusability. As opposed to the approach from SpaceX, whose Falcon 9 rockets use powered decelerations and landings, Rocket Lab’s approach with Electron is to decelerate the vehicle passively using the atmosphere and a parachute.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;&#8216;Complete Success&#8217;: Rocket Lab&#8217;s booster recovery is a big step toward reusability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/embed/#?secret=drLkAA3ePq" data-secret="drLkAA3ePq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The reentry method is constrained by the size of the launch vehicle, Beck explained. “You don’t really have that ability to carry extra fuel to do maneuvers or deceleration burns or anything like that,” he said. Instead, the vehicle enters engines-first and propagates a massive shockwave on its journey back to Earth, carefully managed to reduce peak heat on its vulnerable parts. This results in a nearly negligible payload reduction: about 10%, as opposed to the 30-40% required for a propulsive landing. These are very tight margins, Beck acknowledged. “This is not a simple thing to do. It sounds pretty basic &#8212; let’s just bring the stage back and put it under a parachute and splash down &#8212; but actually, doing it with no significant reentry elements and just using the atmosphere to do all the work is really challenging.”</p>
<p>The final splashdown recovery mission will take place before the end of 2021, Beck said, and will include improvements to the decelerator and a more general block upgrade. Once these missions are complete, Rocket Lab will turn to its ultimate goal: to do away with splashdown recovery altogether and to retrieve the booster mid-descent under its parachute using a helicopter.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company’s next rocket will be the Neutron, “a vehicle designed for reusability from day one,” Beck said. The Neutron will be much larger than its predecessor and capable of lifting heavier payloads to orbit. He estimated that Rocket Lab will construct one Neutron rocket per year and aim to operate a fleet of four to begin with.</p>
