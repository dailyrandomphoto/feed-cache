The company, founded by Jane Poynter and Taber MacCallum, who previously founded stratospheric balloon company World View, is focused on developing Spaceship Neptune, a pressurized passenger capsule that is meant to be carried by an ultra-high altitude balloon to the very edge of space to provide passengers with an unparalleled view.</p>
<p>Spaceship Neptune is designed to carry up to eight passengers per trip, on a six-hour journey that will include two hours spent at the upper edge of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and a water landing in the Atlantic Ocean. The first test flight is currently targeted for the end of the first quarter of 2021, according to Space Perspective, and it will involve flying an uncrewed Neptune capsule prototype, which also won&#8217;t have the pressurized cabin of the final version.</p>

<p>From there, the plan is to test and develop systems necessary for Neptune to take up its first human passengers, with the goal of doing that by sometime around 2024, with ticket pre-sales launching from 2021 for interested, deep-pocketed parties.</p>
<p>Poynter and MacCallum&#8217;s prior venture World View originally included human stratospheric space tourism trips as part of its business model, but the company has since pivoted to focus on scientific and commercial communication and observation payloads exclusively under its current leadership. World View appointed Ryan Hartman as CEO in 2018, replacing Poynter in the top spot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.step.com/">Step</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/step-targets-teens-and-parents-with-a-no-fees-mobile-bank-account-and-visa-card/">mobile banking service aimed at teens</a>, announced this morning it has raised $50 million in Series B funding after growing to over 500,000 users only two months after its official launch. The round was led by Coatue, with returning investors from Stripe, Crosslink Capital, Collaborative Fund, and Will Smith&#8217;s Dreamers VC. The startup also added some celeb investors to this round, including Charli D’Amelio, Justin Timberlake, The Chainsmokers, as well as big names from the world of sports, like Eli Manning, Kelvin Beachum, Larry Fitzgerald and Andre Iguodala.</p>
<p>This is notably Charli D&#8217;Amelio&#8217;s first startup investment, Step tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company had partnered with the TikTok star only a few weeks ago to promote the product and talk about financial literacy across her TikTok and Instagram accounts, which have 101.9 million and 34.4 million followers, respectively. Now she will do that not only as a partner and customer, but as an investor, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As a Step partner and customer, I’ve been able to see firsthand how easy Step makes it to manage your money while providing the educational resources that today’s teens need but have largely been unable to find—myself included,&#8221; said D’Amelio, in a statement. &#8220;I’m excited to be able to use my platform to help close this gap and have made a direct investment in Step to help them develop even more useful products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other celeb investors may also promote the product on social media, including The Chainsmokers, but promotional deals aren&#8217;t finalized with the full list.</p>
<p>Smith, however, has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/will-smith-7">been investing in startups</a> in recent years at the seed stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a person who hasn’t always had financial stability, and made many mistakes in that arena as a young man, I know the importance of financial education and having access to economic platforms that can work for everyone,&#8221; Smith said, in a statement. &#8220;While I’ve tried to instill that same mentality in my own children it was hard to find a banking platform that was intuitive and met our needs as a family. We’ve reinvested in Step because not only are their products built specifically for teens but they’ve started an important conversation around financial literacy that kids are actually engaged in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other participants in the round include fintech executives from Facebook, Square, Venmo, Visa and others. To date, Step has raised over $75 million.</p>
<p>Though competing in now-crowded space of mobile banking services which replace traditional banks with an app on your phone, Step&#8217;s entry point to the market is different from most. It specifically targets teen users ages 13 to 18, by offering them an FDIC-insured bank account without fees, and a secured Visa card that helps them establish credit before they turn 18.</p>
<p>The app, meanwhile, also serves as a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform so they can send money to friends, similar to Apple Pay or Venmo.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081789" style="width: 742px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081789" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2081789" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="732" height="322" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg 2568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=300,132 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=768,338 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=680,299 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=1536,676 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=2048,901 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081789" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Step</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;I think the best way to think about it is &#8216;Venmo meets Chase for the next generation,'&#8221; explains Step founder and CEO CJ MacDonald. &#8220;You have to be 18 to be on Venmo or Cash app, and [with those] you have to have an underlying bank account attached to that to get money in or money out. And most people don&#8217;t use Venmo or Cash app to spend money &#8212; they just use it to send and receive,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Combining P2P and banking in one platform has proven so far to be fairly popular. Step says it&#8217;s now adding around 7,000 to 10,000 new accounts per day, on top of the existing 500,000-plus users it already has. Much of this has comes from the organic, word-of-mouth growth offered by Step&#8217;s referral program, not paid ads. Step offers teens $3 (it used to be just $1) for every friend that signs up under their referral. The teens put the link in their Instagram bio or share it on Snapchat and soon they&#8217;ve made a decent amount of cash, even as much as $30 or $40.</p>
<p>In the near-term, Step plans to leverage its newly partnered celebs to help spread the word about mobile banking and financial responsibility across social media, and is hiring across the board in the face of its rapid growth. Longer-term, however, the company envisions helping teens take the next step in their financial future when they turn 18 with new products.</p>
<p>&#8220;The average college student graduates with thousands of dollars of credit card debt. The average college student also overdrafts two or three times a year, and traditional banking overdraft fees cost $35 in most cases,&#8221; says MacDonald. &#8220;When you go to college or you turn 18, you&#8217;re going to need some level of help. So we absolutely will offer new financial products and services tailored toward that demographic,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>These products may include credit cards, loans, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Student loans are a big thing. Being able to extend credit to these folks. Being able to offer new products and services so they&#8217;re not paying these outrageous, predatory banking fees and high interest credit cards,&#8221; MacDonald, says, speaking to Step&#8217;s plans. &#8220;We&#8217;re really going to push the envelope and offer new types of products and services that are cost effective,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Step, based in San Francisco, currently has 50 employees and is hiring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.heywelcome.com/">Welcome</a>, the HR software that helps organizations make and close offers to new candidates, announced the close of a $6 million seed round today, led by FirstMark Capital. Participating investors include Ludlow Ventures, Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg, and Keenan Rice and Ben Porterfield (which were existing investors), as well as a wide array of angels.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/welcome-raises-1-4m-to-streamline-the-hiring-process/">last covered Welcome in August</a>, when it announced a $1.4 million funding round. That the startup was able to raise more as quickly as it has is testament to how hot the early-stage venture capital market is today, and likely an endorsement of Welcome&#8217;s economic profile and recent growth.</p>
<p>Past the new capital, Welcome is also launching a new product today called Total Rewards, which helps not just new candidates but also existing employees get a complete, easy-to-understand picture of their compensation, across salary, benefits, equity, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But let&#8217;s back up.</p>
<p>Welcome was founded in 2019 by Nick Gavronsky and Rick Pereira, with a mission to help organizations close offers on candidates by providing a much clearer picture of compensation, particularly around equity. Cofounder and CEO Nick Gavronsky explained that many candidates don&#8217;t truly understand the value of the equity they&#8217;re offered, or how it works.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of recruiting teams aren&#8217;t well-equipped to use it as a selling tool and explain it effectively and showcase the value to candidates to help them think about their ownership at the company,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081771" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081771" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4_Candidate-Equity.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="472" class="size-large wp-image-2081771" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4_Candidate-Equity.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4_Candidate-Equity.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4_Candidate-Equity.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4_Candidate-Equity.png?resize=768,533 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4_Candidate-Equity.png?resize=680,472 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4_Candidate-Equity.png?resize=1536,1067 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4_Candidate-Equity.png?resize=2048,1422 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4_Candidate-Equity.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081771" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Welcome</p></div></p>
<p>Welcome allows companies to organize their compensation offers based on level and position, and deliver that information digitally to candidates in a way that makes sense.</p>
<p>The startup integrates with a variety of other software providers including Slack, Lever, Greenhouse, ADP and Justworks to name a few, simplifying onboarding for Welcome clients and bringing a broad array of information into one place.</p>
<p>Offers sent through Welcome show a description of the role, equity details, total compensation and even include a welcome note and video. This is in stark contrast to the black and white legal PDF often sent to candidates.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_Candidate-Welcome-Note.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="472" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2081770" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_Candidate-Welcome-Note.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_Candidate-Welcome-Note.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_Candidate-Welcome-Note.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_Candidate-Welcome-Note.png?resize=768,533 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_Candidate-Welcome-Note.png?resize=680,472 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_Candidate-Welcome-Note.png?resize=1536,1067 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_Candidate-Welcome-Note.png?resize=2048,1422 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_Candidate-Welcome-Note.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The next phase for the company comes in the form of the launch of Total Rewards, which is meant to help retain existing employees, helping them understand their compensation value and their potential at the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Painting a better picture becomes a pre-retention tool,&#8221; said Gavronsky. &#8220;An employee will sometimes leave thousands of dollars on the table because they don&#8217;t understand what they&#8217;re walking away from. A lot of times companies will wait until that person is going to resign. Let me now bring up all the things that are great about our company and talk through your stock options. But the decision&#8217;s already made. So we wanted something that we can kind of put in with performance reviews.&#8221;</p>
<p>Welcome also has plans to offer a third product pillar in the form of real-time accurate industry-wide compensation data, helping companies understand where they fit into the larger ecosystem with regards to compensation.</p>
<p>Thus far, Welcome has 40 companies on the platform, including Uncork and Betterment, with hundreds on the waitlist according to the cofounders. The company plans to use the funding to build out the team and the product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-driving trucks startup TuSimple has closed a $350 million funding round from a diverse consortium of strategic investors that include major U.S. corporations in rail, retail and freight, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to sources familiar with the deal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round, which was oversubscribed, was led by VectoIQ LLC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/25/nikolas-steve-girsky-eyes-his-next-transportation-investment/">confirming a report by TechCrunch</a> in September. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VectoIQ is the consulting and investment company founded by Steve Girsky, the former GM vice chairman, consultant and investor whose special purpose acquisition company merged with hydrogen electric startup Nikola Corp. this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The injection of capital stands out not only because of its size, but the array of companies involved. Goodyear, Union Pacific, CN Rail, freight company U.S. Xpress and retailer Kroger all participated in the round, sources familiar with the deal told TechCrunch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Existing investors Volkswagen AG’s heavy-truck business The Traton Group and Navistar also participated. (Last month, Traton, which already held a 16.6% stake in Navistar agreed to acquire its remaining shares.)</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tusimple-llc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tusimple-llc">TuSimple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has raised $648 million since its founding in 2015.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company declined to comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TuSimple was one of the first autonomous trucking startups to emerge in what has become a small, yet bustling industry that now includes Aurora, Embark, Ike, Kodiak and Waymo. While TuSimple&#8217;s founding team and its earliest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">backers Sina and Composite Capital are from China, a chunk of its operations are in the United States, including its global headquarters in San Diego. TuSimple also operates an engineering center and truck depot in Tucson and more recently set up a facility in Texas to support its autonomous trips —always with a human safety operator behind the wheel. TuSimple also has operations in Beijing and Shanghai. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As TuSimple has scaled with workforce and testing in the U.S., it has diversified its customer and investor base. The co</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mpany has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks/">attracted a number of investors</a> and partners in recent years, including UPS, Korean Tier 1 supplier Mando Corporation, Traton Group and now U.S. Xpress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TuSimple raised $55 million in 2017 with plans to use those funds to scale up testing to two full truck fleets in China and the United States. By 2018, TuSimple began to test on public roads, beginning with a 120-mile highway stretch between Tucson and Phoenix in Arizona and another segment in Shanghai. TuSimple has since expanded operations into Texas. </span></p>
<p>Last year, the company&#8217;s valuation eked over the $1 billion-mark after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/13/autonomous-truck-startup-tusimple-hits-unicorn-status-in-latest-round/">raising $95 million</a> in a Series D funding round. It&#8217;s unclear what TuSimple&#8217;s new post-money valuation is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As promised, more info following yesterday’s Snapdragon 888 announcement. First off, as expected, the company’s next flagship SoC will arrive in the first quarter of next year. We’re still waiting on specific models, but as noted yesterday, the San Diego-based chip giant already has a lineup of smartphone makers planning to employ the 765 follow-up, including ASUS, Black Shark, LG, MEIZU, Motorola, Nubia, realme, OnePlus, OPPO, Sharp, vivo, Xiaomi and ZTE.</p>
<p>The focuses are also what you’d expect: 5G, AI, speed, security, imaging and gaming. As <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/qualcomm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="qualcomm">Qualcomm <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced earlier, the new system sports the third-gen X60 5G modem, which supports both sub-6 and mmWave variations of the wireless technology with speeds up to 7.5 Gbps. Also on board is support for Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2.</p>
<p>The sixth-gen version of the company’s AI Engine brings faster processing speeds at lower power consumption — specifically up to 3x performance per watt, per Qualcomm’s numbers. That’s capable of up to 26 tera operations per second (TOPS). Compare that to the “incredible” 5.5 TOPS the company was talking up on the Snapdragon 765 roughly this time last year. The AI stuff is primarily used to boost camera, gaming, connectivity and voice assistants like Google’s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the camera side, the new chip features the improved Spectra 580, sporting the line’s first triple ISP (image signal processor). That’s going to go a ways toward fostering multi-camera setup, with the ability to simultaneously have three cameras at up to 2.7 gigapixels a second. The system also supports capture of three 4K HDR videos at once — overkill, perhaps, but neat. There’s improved low-light support as well, to brighten up dark shots — always a nice thing.</p>
<p>The on-board Adreno 660 GPU can do up to 35% faster graphics. The Kryo 680 — based on the new Arm Cortex-X1 architecture — brings up to a 25% uplift in CPU performance. Game rendering has been improved by up to 30%, and titles will get access to Variable Rate Shading — a first for a Qualcomm chip. As for security, the new chip offers a number of new features aimed at protecting on-device data, including the Qualcomm Secure Processing Unit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://jitsu.com/">Jitsu</a>, a graduate of the Y Combinator Summer 2020 cohort, is developing an open source data integration platform that helps developers send data to a data warehouse. Today, the startup announced a $2 million seed investment.</p>
<p>Costanoa Ventures led the round with participation from YCombintaor, The House Fund and SignalFire.</p>
<p>In addition to the open source version of the software, the company has developed a hosted version that companies can pay to use, which shares the same name as the company. Peter Wysinski, Jitsu&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, says a good way to think about his company is an open source <a href="http://segment.com">Segment</a>, the customer data integration company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilios-3-2b-segment-acquisition-about-helping-developers-build-data-fueled-apps/">was recently sold to Twilio for $3.2 billion</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But he says, it goes beyond what Segment by allowing you to move all kinds of data whether customer data, connected device data or other types. &#8220;If you look at the space in general, companies want more granularity. So let&#8217;s say for example, a couple years ago you wanted to sync just your transactions from QuickBooks to your data warehouse, now you want to capture every single sale at the point of sale. What Jitsu lets you do is capture essentially all of those events, all of those streams, and send them to your data warehouse,&#8221; Wysinski explained.</p>
<p>Among the data warehouses it currently supports include Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, PostGres and Snowflake.</p>

<p>The founders built the open source project called <a href="https://github.com/jitsucom/eventnative">EventNative</a> to help solve problems they themselves were having moving data around at their previous jobs. After putting the open source version on GitHub a few months ago, they quickly attained 1000 stars, proving that they had delivered something that solved a common problem for data teams. They then built the hosted version, Jitsu, which went live a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>For now, the company is just the two co-founders, Wysinski and CTO Vladimir Klimontovich, but they intend to do some preliminary hiring over the next year to grow the company, most likely adding engineers. As they begin to build out the startup, Wysinski says that being open source will help drive diversity and inclusion in their hiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is essentially to go after that open source community and hire people from anywhere because engineers aren&#8217;t just [&#8230;] one color or one race, they&#8217;re everywhere, and being open source, and especially being in a remote world, makes it so so much simpler [to build a diverse workforce], and a lot of companies I feel are going down that road,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says along that line, the plan is to be a fully remote company, even after the pandemic ends, as they hire from anywhere. The goal is to have quarterly offsite meetings to check in with employees, but do the majority of the work remotely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.shop-ware.com/">Shop-Ware </a>has been waiting for a year like 2020 since 2015.</p>
<p>The startup, which sells software to neighborhood automotive shops to digitize their operations, had struggled to capture capital from venture firms. Until recently, its sole major investor was aftermarket automotive giant Bosch.</p>
<p>For companies like Shop-Ware, the disruptive wake of COVID-19 has cleared a path to capital as mainstream investors have sought out startups with services and products needed in the pandemic era. Investors finally get Shop-Ware founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolyn-coquillette/">Carolyn Coquillette</a>’s vision and business. Their endorsement: $15 million in funding through a Series A round led by Insight Partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It’s a different level of validation in terms of this industry going through a transition and catching the eye of traditional investors,” Coquillette said.</p>
<p>Coquillette says Shop-Ware will use he funds to fuel growth across its operations, sales and marketing teams.</p>
<p>The fresh capital comes as Shop-Ware has tripled its customer base while also lowering churn, Coquillette said, although she would not disclose total revenue numbers or whether the company is profitable.</p>
<p>The idea of Shop-Ware began when Coquillette started her own San Francisco-based auto shop, Luscious Garage, in 2007. The goal from the get-go was to offer customers a peek into what happens in an auto shop. It meant more communications from the repair-person to the car-owner, and a software platform was the best way to do it. Eventually, the push for modernized software became less of an in-house project and more of a standalone company. By 2015, she had a product and an incorporated company.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Wh6pBCorYv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/12/how-a-unique-approach-to-auto-repair-led-to-a-new-kind-of-shop-software/">How a unique approach to auto repair led to a new kind of shop software</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How a unique approach to auto repair led to a new kind of shop software&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/12/how-a-unique-approach-to-auto-repair-led-to-a-new-kind-of-shop-software/embed/#?secret=Wh6pBCorYv" data-secret="Wh6pBCorYv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Shop-Ware helps auto-repair shops streamline operations both inside and out of the shop. Auto-repair shops are able to use Shop-Ware to track employee hours, inventory ordering and management and integrate with third-party tools such as Quickbooks. Shop-Ware also helps the neighborhood auto-repair worker communicate and charge customers through text or a web-based interface.</p>
<p>The intricacies of car ownership are something that Coquillette thinks that the average consumer doesn’t understand, so she built an entire business around adding more transparency to the clunky process.</p>
<p>“There is no way that a normal person is going to appreciate what it takes to fix their car,” Coquillette said. “The car is built to distract you and hide its complication for you by design so that you agree to buy it.” In other words, she says, you’re buying a “magic carpet.”</p>
<p>It’s an easy pitch for the most part, the founder says.</p>
<p>“Everybody who owns the car has gone to a repair shop and had an unsavory experience,” she said. “It&#8217;s pretty obvious to be like ‘oh yeah, you can make that experience less unsavory.’”</p>
<p>The real roadblock for the startup is convincing a business to adopt technology to change a process that isn’t technically broken. COVID-19 has been the impetus for auto shops — some of which have been steadfast in their pen-and-paper approach —to turn to a digital platform to communicate and operate.</p>
<p>The sector of digitizing auto-repair processes has grown considerably since Shop-Ware first launched five years ago.</p>
<p>Concierge startups such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/cardash-5-3-million/">CarDash</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/wrenchs-on-demand-vehicle-repair-and-maintenance-service-picks-up-20-million/">Wrench</a> have popped up over the past several years to give customers an easier way to request maintenance checks. The services consolidate auto repair shops under one, approachable umbrella, which Coquillette thinks is the wrong approach.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m a real big believer that you need to enable those independent providers,” she said. “You have to basically let those special snowflakes be their own snowflakes.”</p>
<p>A closer competitor to Shop-Ware is <a href="https://www.shopmonkey.io/">Shopmonkey</a>, which raised a <a href="https://www.shopmonkey.io/post/shopmonkey-raises-a-25-million-series-b-led-by-bessemer-venture-partners">$25 million Bessemer-led Series B</a> in August. It is welcome competition, Coquillette remarks, because it has put an investment spotlight on the category.</p>
<p>“There’s been a wakeup call around autonomy and how we related to our cars,” she said.</p>
<p>Now it’s up to Shop-Ware to take that wakeup call and turn it into cash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Looking Glass’s technology is extremely cool, but has, thus far, been prohibitively expensive, ranging from $600 for its 8.9-inch product to $6,000 for the 15-inch model &#8212; and an undisclosed sum for its 32-inch 8K display. Portrait might not be the most technically ambitious or versatile product the Brooklyn-based startup has produced, but it&#8217;s easily the most accessible.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pJxdNRA1CM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>At $349, it’s still not cheap (though it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lookingglass/looking-glass-portrait">$199 if you get in early via Kickstarter</a>), but it has to be one of the most affordable holographic displays on the market. Along with the pricing, the company is taking a more populist approach to functionality, as well, offering up what is essentially a very advanced digital photo frame. The system offers up to 100 different perspectives on a 3D image, which, unlike products like Sony’s new 3D display, can be viewed by multiple people at once.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2077814" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077814" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077814" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sloth-Face-Tracking.gif" alt="" width="700" height="369" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077814" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Looking Glass</p></div></p>
<p>The system can also be run without being tethered to a computer. Its standalone mode relies on a built-in computer to deliver a 60 FPS holographic image. Those photos, meanwhile, can be captured with an iPhone and edited into a 3D image using the included HoloPlay Studio software. Holographic videos can also be captured with Azure Kinect and Intel RealSense cameras.</p>

<p>“It’s the first step toward holographic video calls,” the company notes, perhaps tipping its hand a bit about future plans.</p>
<p>“Ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of the moment that I’d be able to have a holographic display of my own,” CEO Shawn Frayne says in the release. “I imagined what it would be like to send someone a holographic birthday message, or to say hello as a hologram to my great-great-great granddaughter. Looking Glass Portrait, the culmination of six years of work by our Brooklyn and Hong Kong based team, makes those dreams real for more people than ever before.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jio Platforms, the biggest telecom operator in India and which has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">over $20 billion from Facebook, Google</a> and other high-profile investors this year, is leading a financing round of a San Francisco-based startup that develops augmented-reality mobile games.</p>
<p>Jio has led the Series A fundraise of Krikey, founded by sisters Jhanvi and Ketaki Shriram, the Indian firm said on Wednesday. They did not disclose the size of Krikey&#8217;s Series A round, but Jio said Krikey has raised $22 million to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.krikey.com/">Krikey</a> has previously not disclosed any financing rounds, according to their listings on Crunchbase, CBInsights, and Tracxn. Jio also did not share who else participated in Krikey&#8217;s new round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the announcement, Krikey has launched Yaatra, a new AR game that invites users to step in an action-adventure story to defeat a monster army. “Using weapons such as the bow and arrow, chakra, lightning and fire bolts, players can battle through different levels of combat and puzzle games,” Krikey said.</p>
<p>Jio subscribers in India will get exclusive access to a range of features in Krikey, available on Android and iOS, including a 3D avatar, and entry to some game levels and weapons. Jio said Yaatra game would also be made available to JioPhone feature phone users.</p>
<p>Krikey has developed two additional games in the past, including Gorillas, a game the startup developed in partnership with Ellen DeGeneres&#8217;s wildlife foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe AR has a huge potential in not just gaming but in many other industries to disrupt the way people interact with the world around them. We are very excited to use the phone as the window back into the natural world and hope that people&#8217;s experiences in empathising with birds and guerrillas and different ecosystems will encourage them to start to take real-world conservation behaviour changes,&#8221; said Jhanvi in an <a href="https://cheddar.com/media/how-krikey-is-using-ar-to-support-ellens-wildlife-fund">interview with Cheddar</a> last year.</p>
<p>“Our vision with Krikey is to bring together inspiration and reality in an immersive way. With augmented reality, we are able to bring fantasy worlds into your home, straight through the window of your mobile phone,” said Jhanvi and Ketaki Shriram in a joint statement today. They have previously participated in Apple&#8217;s female entrepreneur camp.</p>
<p>In a statement, Akash Ambani, Director of Jio, said, “Krikey will inspire a generation of Indians to embrace Augmented Reality. Our vision is to bring the best experiences from across the world to India and the introduction of Yaatra is a step in that direction. Augmented Reality gaming takes the user into a world of its own, and we invite every Jio and non-Jio user to experience AR through Yaatra.”</p>
<p>Jio has previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/jiosaavn/">acquired music streaming service Saavn</a> (which has since been rebranded to JioSaavn), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/reliance-jio-buys-haptik-for-100-million/">Haptik</a>, a startup that develops conversational platforms and virtual assistants.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Jio and Krikey for more details.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jan Bednar started <a href="https://www.shipmonk.com/">ShipMonk</a> with $70,000 in winnings from a string of student business plan competitions and launched the business that just closed on $290 million in new funding from a small warehouse with no air conditioning in the middle of Florida.</p>
<p>While Bednar&#8217;s new offices are still inside the warehouse his company operates, they now have air conditioning&#8230; and a $290 million financing round from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/summit-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="summit-partners">Summit Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to grow its business.</p>
<p>The Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based ShipMonk provides a slew of shipping and logistics services for small to medium-sized eCommerce businesses and right now &#8212; given the continuing COVID-19 pandemic &#8212; business is good.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We help SMBs and mid-market direct to consumer companies manage their supply chains. Help get their products from suppliers to facilities and connect with all of their sales channels including B2B … order management, transportation management, reverse logistics,&#8221; said Bednar. </span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s largest customers can book anywhere from $150 million to $250 million in revenue, but most of ShipMonk&#8217;s customers are actually small businesses pulling in between $1 million and $10 million on average.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for these businesses that ShipMonk will fill its warehouses in Pennsylvania, California and Florida with 60,000 stock keeping units &#8212; managing around 50 different items for each customer it serves.</p>
<p>Bednar said ShipMonk would use the new cash to continue to upgrade its automation services and increase its staffing while also looking to expand internationally.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Profitable from the outset, ShipMonk just came off one of its best years, taking in upwards of $140 million in revenue. </span></p>
<p>Bednar began the business alone, but quickly brought on co-founders Kevin Seitz, who handles marketing for the business, and Bosch Jares, a fellow native of the Czech Republic (like Bednar) who serves as the company&#8217;s chief technology officer.</p>
<p>The story of how Jares joined the business is indicative of the type of hustle that&#8217;s allowed Bednar to grow a booming tech and logistics business from the Ft. Lauderdale beaches.</p>
<p>It was the Florida weather that sold Jares, a college student from one of the Czech Republic&#8217;s top technical institutions, on the move to ShipMonk. Bednar had posted an internship opportunity to work (unpaid, but offering room and board) at his company on a college job board in the middle of January. The applications came pouring in, but it was Jares, a programmer who had been working with computers since age 14 who took the slot.</p>
<p>The rest&#8230; is ShipMonk history. Jares built the bulk of the backend for the company&#8217;s initial services spending nearly 20 hours a day coding.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The thriftiness and hard work has won ShipMonk a booming business that has grown from 15,000 square feet of warehousing space into nearly 1 million square feet of storage space and a logistics service that spans the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timing for the new round couldn&#8217;t be better, as National Retail Federation estimates are banking on a 20% bump in new online sales &#8212; which could reach $202 billion this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Friday alone raked in $9 billion in online purchases, according to data from Adobe Analytics provided by the company, and consumer spending is only going to continue to move online as the pandemic continues to threaten the health and safety of American consumers.  </span></p>
<p>ShipMonk&#8217;s technology integrates with shopping cart and marketplace platforms like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to import orders across sales channels, which are then processed at the company&#8217;s warehouse locations. Customers can save up to 50% on their operational costs, according to the company.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe ShipMonk truly demonstrates the power of a bootstrapped, durable growth mindset. Jan identified a significant gap in the market and, together with the ShipMonk team, has scaled the business in a deliberate and capital efficient manner to address that need. The results have been impressive,” said Christopher Dean, a Managing Director at Summit Partners who is taking a seat on the company&#8217;s board. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Conferences have &#8212; for better or worse (and if you&#8217;ve ever been trapped in a cavernous CES exhibition hall, you might say worse) &#8212; become a significant cornerstone of how industries engage with their audiences, whether they are comics superfans, or iOS developers, or insurance brokers. This year has undoubtedly seen a huge shift in how those conferences exist. The Covid-19 health pandemic has drastically curtailed travel and how people spend time in crowded places, decimating the wider event industry, <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/events-industry-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated</a> to be worth more than $1 trillion annually before Covid, in its wake.</p>
<p>Today, however, comes news of a significant round of funding for a startup that is showing one way out of the mess. <a href="https://www.bizzabo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bizzabo</a>, which provides a platform to plan and run both virtual and in-person conferences, from its earliest stages of conception and handling sponsorships, through to managing interactions between attendees, and provisioning the conference itself, has closed a round of $138 million.</p>
<p>CEO Eran Ben-Shushan (who co-founded the company with Alon Alroy and Boaz Katz) said in an interview that it will use the new capital to drive the growth of its business, after seeing its business boom this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Running conferences for large businesses and event planners, its customers include companies like Uber, Gainsight, Github, WeWork, Accenture and actually &#8212; disclosure &#8211;TechCrunch. This year, Bizzabo&#8217;s revenue has grown 100%, with the number of events organized through Bizzabo up 65%, he said. Meanwhile, the number of attendees registering for events with Bizzabo up 500% and overall usage is up 150x.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a vaccine likely and more hybrid events in the future, we anticipate even greater growth,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Bizzabo has been the category leader, experiencing hyper-growth both pre-pandemic and during the virtual transition, we are excited to continue to lead the market forward by doubling down on product, technology, and user experience, to help organizations unlock the power of hybrid experiences.”</p>
<p>He said that will include the building of more tech to integrate virtual and in-person experiences, and tripling its engineering, product and experience teams, adding two new offices in Europe for the Tel Aviv-New York startup.</p>
<p>This Series E is being led by Insight Partners, the VC known for its big growth investments, with previous backers Viola Growth, Next47, and OurCrowd also participating. Viola led Bizzabo&#8217;s previous round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/bizzabo-series-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$27 million Series D </a>in April 2019.</p>
<p>Ben-Shushan did not disclose the valuation today except to say that it has grown by 400% since then. The company has raised some $195 million to date, and for some further context on valuation, recall that Hopin &#8212; another platform to help manage events online &#8212; last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised $125 million at a $2 billion+ valuation</a>.</p>
<p>Bizzabo started life in 2011 positioning itself as the &#8220;Salesforce for events.&#8221; Leaning heavily on cloud architecture and providing integrations into the many productivity and communication tools that an event organizer might use, the idea was to provide a platform to knit all that together and give organizers a way of using apps and online services to extend touch points between and with attendees. That could take the form of registration software to sign people up and collect payments for would-be attendees; chatrooms for people at specific sessions, better ways for exhibitors and sponsors to connect with visitors, and for those visitors to connect with each other during and after the event.</p>
<p>All of that changed this year when key in-person confabs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/gmsa-cancels-mobile-world-congress-due-to-coronavirus-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started to get cancelled</a>. At first, many of these just disappeared into a black hole with virtually nothing to replace them, but then gradually, as the year went on, organisers started to seek out virtual alternatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The virtual conference market was almost non-existent&#8221; before 2020, said Ben-Shushan. &#8220;Pre Covid, a fraction of events were virtual, less than 2% of total events. March 2020 started the virtual transition period in which live events were no longer possible in most parts of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>That transition dovetailed with an even bigger shift in workplace communications: a huge surge of video use spearheaded by the likes of Zoom, Google, Microsoft and many others that had built platforms for people not just to speak to each other over the internet, but to see each other, too. While videoconferencing has been around for years, much of it was based around very costly hardware and software packages used mostly by large corporates. The big innovation was leveraging the growth of faster internet, better basic computers and cameras, and the cloud to make videoconferencing something everyone could use.</p>
<p>And with the arrival of the pandemic, everyone did.</p>
<p>Event organizers seized the moment, too, and the bigger conferences, which had already been offering streams of keynotes and other notable sessions to those who could not attend in person, started to think of how to shift the whole experience online. That brought a whole new set of demands onto organisers and those participating in the conferences. How best to network when you can&#8217;t share a drink or an awkward lunch around a high table together? How do you recreate the buzz of a big audience? How do you convince people to pay those sweet, sweet conference fees when all they are doing is clicking on a button in their home offices, possibly still in their pyjamas?</p>
<p>Some of those are easier to answer than others; all of them are a lot of pressure. But for Bizzabo, the challenges were considerably smaller: it found a huge demand suddenly for the tools it had already built to help with many of those communication issues; and for what it didn&#8217;t already do, it was easy to identify what that was and add it in. It hasn&#8217;t rebuilt its platform; it has just continued to extend what it does within it.</p>
<p>For example, Bizzabo might not have offered or at least highlighted streaming as a core part of its platform, but it&#8217;s very much a part of it now, in partnership with <a href="https://corp.kaltura.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaltura</a>, which provides live streaming technology as a service.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a lot of the last year for the events industry has been focused on how to make up for what has been cancelled, in a search of like-for-like. Even when it hasn&#8217;t found that, the industry has discovered some interesting approaches to provide new, and sometimes even better, bridges between people. Still, Bizzabo ultimately does not think the live event should be left for dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our data shows that although there are meaningful advantages to virtual events (higher reach, lower production costs), event organizers and attendees want to go back to live events,&#8221; said Ben-Shusan. &#8220;2021 will mark a new era in the event industry &#8211; the hybrid era that integrates experiences of remote and live participants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hybrid will indeed be the name of the game, it seems, even if we still may have a lot of question marks over how big that game will be after all this is over. Inevitably, some events may never come back.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has permanently transformed the professional events category,” said Matt Gatto, a Managing Director at Insight Partners, who will join the Bizzabo board of directors, in a statement. “Bizzabo’s impressive growth and momentum began pre-pandemic and accelerated during it as they launched the industry’s first end-to-end event technology solution. Their pedigree in both in-person and virtual events and their impressive execution capabilities have them well-positioned to lead this rapidly evolving space. We are excited to partner with their leadership team and to support them in this new phase of growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sifting through the trillions of molecules out there that might have powerful medicinal effects is a daunting task, but the solution biotech has found is to work smarter, not harder. <a href="https://www.genesistherapeutics.ai/index.html">Genesis Therapeutics</a> has a new simulation approach and cross-disciplinary team that has clearly made an impression: the company just raised a $52 million A round.</p>
<p>Genesis competed in the Startup Battlefield at Disrupt last year, impressing judges with its potential, and obviously others saw it as well — in particular Rock Springs Capital, which led the round.</p>
<p>Over the last few years many companies have been formed in the drug discovery space, powered by increased computing and simulation power that lets them determine the potential of molecules in treating certain diseases. At least that&#8217;s the theory. The reality is a bit messier, and while these companies can narrow the search, they can&#8217;t just say &#8220;here, a cure for Parkinson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founder Evan Feinberg got into the field when an illness he inherited made traditional lab work, as an intern at a big pharma company, difficult for him. The computational side of the field, however, was more accessible and ended up absorbing him entirely.</p>
<p>He had dabbled in the area before and arrived at what he feels is a breakthrough in how molecules are represented digitally. Machine learning has, of course, accelerated work in many fields, biochemistry among them, but he felt that the potential of the technology had not been tapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think initially the attempts were to kind of cut and paste deep learning techniques, and represent molecules a lot like images, and classify them — like you&#8217;d say, this is a cat picture or this is not a cat picture,&#8221; he explained in an interview. &#8220;We represent the molecules more naturally: as graphs. A set of nodes or vertices, those are atoms, and things that connect them, those are bonds. But we&#8217;re representing them not just as <em>bond</em> or <em>no bond</em>, but with multiple contact types between atoms, spatial distances, more complex features.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="G3ELdGfwPd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/atomwises-machine-learning-based-drug-discovery-service-raises-123-million/">Atomwise&#8217;s machine learning-based drug discovery service raises $123 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Atomwise&#8217;s machine learning-based drug discovery service raises $123 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/atomwises-machine-learning-based-drug-discovery-service-raises-123-million/embed/#?secret=G3ELdGfwPd" data-secret="G3ELdGfwPd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The resulting representation is richer and more complex, a more complete picture of a molecule than you&#8217;d get from its chemical formula or a stick diagram showing the different structures and bonds. Because in the world of biochemistry, nothing is as simple as a diagram. Every molecule exists as a complicated, shifting 3D shape or conformation where important aspects like the distance between two carbon formations or bonding sites is subject to many factors. Genesis attempts to model as many of those factors as it can.</p>
<p>&#8220;Step one is the representation,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the logical next step is, how does one leverage that representation to learn a function that takes an input and outputs a number, like binding affinity or solubility, or a vector that predicts multiple properties at once?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the work they&#8217;ve focused on as a company — not just creating a better model molecule, but being able to put a theoretical molecule into simulation and say, it will do this, it won&#8217;t do this, it has this quality but not that one.</p>
<p>Some of this work may be done in partnerships, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201019005182/en/Genesis-Therapeutics-Enters-AI-driven-Multi-Target-Drug-Discovery-Partnership-with-Genentech">such as the one Genesis has struck up with Genentech</a>, but the teams could very well find drug candidates independent of those, and for that reason the company is also establishing an internal development process.</p>
<p>The $52M infusion ought to do a lot to push that forward, Feinberg wrote in an email:</p>
<p>&#8220;These funds allow us to execute on a number of critical objectives, most importantly further pioneering AI technologies for drug development and advancing our therapeutics pipeline. We will be hiring more top notch AI researchers, software engineers, medicinal chemists and biotech talent, as well as building our own research labs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other companies are doing simulations as well and barking up the same tree, but Feinberg says Genesis has at least two legs up on them, despite the competition raising hundreds of millions and existing for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the only company in the space that&#8217;s working at the intersection of modern deep neural network approaches and biophysical simulation — conformational change of ligands and proteins,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we&#8217;re bringing this super technical platform to experts who have taken FDA-approved drugs to market. We&#8217;ve seen tremendous value creation just from that — the chemists inform the AI too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The recent breakthrough of AlphaFold, which is performing the complex task of simulation protein folding far faster than any previous system, is as exciting to Feinberg as to everyone else in the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;As scientists, we are incredibly excited by recent progress in protein structure prediction. It is an important basic science advance that will ultimately have important downstream benefits to the development of novel therapeutics,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Since our Dynamic PotentialNet technology is unique in how it leverages 3D structural information of proteins, computational protein folding &#8212; similar to recent progress in cryo-EM &#8212; is a nice complementary tailwind for the Genesis AI Platform. We applaud all efforts to make protein structure more accessible such that therapeutics can be more easily developed for patients of all conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also participating in the funding round were T. Rowe Price Associates, Andreessen Horowitz (who led the seed round), Menlo Ventures, and Radical Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-authorises-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine">approved</a> the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19 for emergency use, following the recommendation of the national medicines regulator.</p>
<p>The UK is the first country to approve the vaccine for widespread use &#8212; paving the way for some of the most &#8220;high risk&#8221; citizens, such as elderly care home residents and front-line healthcare workers, to get the jab before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55145696">BBC</a> reports that the UK&#8217;s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said the vaccine is safe to be rolled out from next week. Though it&#8217;s not yet clear exactly who will get the first doses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The request for emergency authorization was submitted by BioNTech and Pfizer to the MHRA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/pfizer-and-biontech-to-submit-request-for-emergency-use-approval-of-their-covid-19-vaccine-today/">last month</a> &#8212; as well as to regulators in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and the U.S., none of which has yet given the go ahead.</p>
<p>In a statement, Albert Bourla, chairman and CEO of Pfizer, described the Emergency Use Authorization in the U.K. as &#8220;a historic moment in the fight against COVID-19&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This authorization is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the U.K.,” he said. “As we anticipate further authorizations and approvals, we are focused on moving with the same level of urgency to safely supply a high-quality vaccine around the world. With thousands of people becoming infected, every day matters in the collective race to end this devastating pandemic.”</p>
<p>The UK approval is based on trial data, including a worldwide Phase 3 clinical study carried out by BioNTech/Pfizer  which demonstrated an efficacy rate for the vaccine of 95% and raised no serious safety concerns.</p>
<p>The vaccine was also shown to be effective both in participants who had not previously contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus and those who had &#8212; based on measuring efficacy seven days after the second dose.</p>
<p>Efficacy was also reported as consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics, with an observed efficacy in adults age 65 and over of more than 94%, the companies said.</p>
<p>UK prime minister Boris Johnson tweeted the news of the formal authorization this morning &#8212; writing that the vaccine will &#8220;begin to be made available across the UK from next week&#8221;. (A <a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1334052433807482881">second tweet</a> anticipated how vaccination in general will &#8220;ultimately&#8221; enable a return to economic life as usual.)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The UK has ordered 40M doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, or enough vaccine for 20M people (as it requires two doses), though it will take time for the country to receive all the doses ordered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The delivery of the 40 million doses will occur throughout 2020 and 2021, in stages, to ensure an equitable allocation of vaccines across the geographies with executed contracts,&#8221; the companies wrote in a press release.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that the vaccine is authorized in the U.K., the companies will take immediate action to begin the delivery of vaccine doses. The first doses are expected to arrive in the U.K. in the coming days, with complete delivery fulfilment expected in 2021,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s National Health Service is gearing up for what NHS chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, described as &#8220;the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country&#8217;s history&#8221;. Per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55145696">BBC</a>, some 50 hospitals are on standby and vaccination centers in venues such as conference centres are also being set up.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1334072677053521920">comments</a> to journalists this morning, health secretary Matt Hancock said 800,000 doses of the virus will be available next week, with the bulk of the rollout coming in the new year. &#8220;We&#8217;ll deploy it at the speed that it&#8217;s manufactured,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Hancock said priority for the first batch of jabs will be given to &#8220;the most elderly&#8221; and people in care homes, including their carers. &#8220;Then essentially it comes down the age range. NHS staff are also high on that priority list, and also the clinically extremely vulnerable&#8230; those that are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus,&#8221; he added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Help is on its way. </p>
<p>The MHRA has formally authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for Covid-19. </p>
<p>The NHS stands ready to start vaccinating early next week. </p>
<p>The UK is the first country in the world to have a clinically approved vaccine for supply.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The vaccine requires two doses taken 21 days apart. Speaking at a press conference today, officials from the MHRA and the UK&#8217;s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation confirmed full immunity comes seven days after the second dose, although they noted partial immunity can arise a number of days after taking the first dose.</p>
<p>In the press conference the MHRA&#8217;s CEO, Dr June Raine, said the public can have &#8220;absolute confidence&#8221; in the standards of checks carried out on the data which led to the vaccine&#8217;s approval &#8212; describing them as &#8220;equivalent&#8221; to those ongoing at international counterparts such as the US&#8217; Food and Drug Administration, which has not yet given the go ahead for use.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s speed was down to months of preparation, starting in the summer &#8212; such as mounting teams and building capacity so staff could work in parallel, she said.</p>
<p>Asked whether brexit had anything to do with the regulator authorizing the vaccine quicker than EU counterparts &#8212; something <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/02/hancock-brexit-helped-uk-to-speedy-approval-of-covid-vaccine?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Hancock has claimed</a> &#8212; Raine rather said it had benefitted from being able to use provisions under European law that exist until January 1 (when the brexit transition period ends).</p>
<p>The MHRA&#8217;s speedy approval was dependent on access to rolling data and expertise, she said &#8212; raising questions about whether the UK&#8217;s impending exit from the EU will slow down approval of additional COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our progress has been totally dependent on the availability of data in our rolling review and the rigorous assessment and independent advice we have received so I hope that clarifies the point about the European relationship,&#8221; Raine added.</p>
<p>JVCI officials said operational constraints associated with the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine&#8217;s requirement for very cold storage (-70 degrees) could lead to some &#8220;flexibility&#8221; in implementing the first phase of the vaccination program &#8212; which otherwise intends it to be offered to priority groups in the following order:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081597" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081597" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081597" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png 845w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-02-at-11.14.02.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081597" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: MHRA/JVCI press conference slide</p></div></p>
<p>So it could mean, for example, that front line healthcare staff get bumped up if it&#8217;s easier to supply the vaccine to them as a result of cold storage facilities where they work. However the officials also noted that the vaccine is stable for a short period between 2-8 degrees &#8212; which they suggested will help with the challenge of distribution in care homes.</p>
<p>The UK is obtaining its supply of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine from within the EU &#8212; from a manufacturing facility in Belgium. It&#8217;s not clear whether the impending end of the Brexit transition period will pose any logistical challenges to a smooth future supply of the vaccine &#8212; by putting a brake on Hancock&#8217;s plan to roll it out at the pace it&#8217;s manufactured. This is because negotiations are ongoing between the UK and the EU over a possible post-brexit trade deal, with concerns of major border delays resulting from customs checks in the event of no deal.</p>
<p>Another remaining (non-UK specific) question is how long the vaccine&#8217;s protection lasts. Given how quickly the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine has been developed &#8212; in a matter of months &#8212; there&#8217;s no long term data available to answer that yet.</p>
<p>The same is true of COVID-19 vaccine candidates being developed by other companies.</p>
<p>“The Emergency Use Authorization in the U.K. will mark the first time citizens outside of the trials will have the opportunity to be immunized against COVID-19,” said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and co-founder of BioNTech in a supporting statement. “We believe that the roll-out of the vaccination program in the U.K. will reduce the number of people in the high-risk population being hospitalized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aim is to bring a safe and effective vaccine upon approval to the people who need it. The data submitted to regulatory agencies around the world are the result of a scientifically rigorous and highly ethical research and development program.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>, the U.K. challenger bank now with more than 4.8 million customers, has closed another £60 million in funding, priced the same as and effectively an extension of the its previous top-up round in June.</p>
<p>This saw Monzo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/monzo-confirms-60m-down-round/">valued by private investors at around £1.2 billion</a>, marked by industry observers as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/monzo-confirms-60m-down-round/">down round</a>. It was lower than the upstart bank&#8217;s previous &#8212; perhaps overheated &#8212; valuation, before the Coronavirus pandemic skewed leverage in favour of investors or forced a legitimate fintech market correction, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>The new funding comes from a clutch of new backers including Deliveroo and Stripe investor Novator, Kaiser, and TED Global, as well as existing investor Goodwater. They join the likes of Y Combinator, General Catalyst, Accel, Passion, Thrive and Stripe, who all re-invested earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It means Monzo has raised £125 million in funding since COVID-19 struck (an additional £5 million was quietly added during the last top up), and this current extension will be seen as good news for the bank as it looks to continue growing and increasing revenue lines beyond interchange fees.</p>
<p>To that end, Monzo shared some latest numbers with TechCrunch. In addition to approaching 5 million customers overall, it now has more than 60,000 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/monzo-business-bank-accounts/">business users</a> &#8212; up from 25,000 signups in June &#8212; and more than 100,000 customers across its paid-for current accounts, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/monzo-plus/">Monzo Plus</a> and Monzo Premium.</p>

<p>Adds Monzo CEO, TS Anil, in a statement given to TechCrunch: “We’ve raised £125 million this year, achieved strong organic growth and are now nearing five million customers, all while becoming the most switched to bank in the U.K. and the top rated for overall service. This news demonstrates the confidence that both our customers and investors have in Monzo”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it has been a challenging time for Monzo, as it, along with many other fintech companies, has had to weather the coronavirus crisis and resulting economic downturn. This included utilising the U.K. furlough scheme and subsequently making around 80 employees redundant in the Summer. In addition, there was a round of U.S. layoffs and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/monzo-to-shutter-las-vegas/">shuttering</a> of its Las Vegas-based customer support office.</p>

<p>Like some other banks and fintechs, the coronavirus crisis has resulted in Monzo seeing customer card spend reduce at home and (of course) abroad, meaning it is generating less revenue from interchange fees.</p>
<p>Separately, in May, Monzo co-founder Tom Blomfield announced internally that he was stepping down as CEO of the U.K. challenger bank to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/monzo-co-founder-tom-blomfield-moves-from-uk-ceo-role-to-president/">take up the newly created role of president</a>. He was replaced as U.K. CEO by then U.S. CEO Anil, who also joined Monzo&#8217;s board in replacement of Blomfield.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-12-01/6-new-features-to-unwrap-in-your-spotify-2020-wrapped/">launching</a> its <a href="http://www.spotify.com/wrapped">2020 Wrapped</a> personalized experience &#8212; the company&#8217;s popular year-end review of users&#8217; favorite artists, songs, genres, and podcasts. This year, however, Spotify is making a few changes. For starters, Wrapped will be exclusively available on mobile for Spotify users, while a web experience will offer a version of Wrapped for non-Spotify users for the first time. To reflect Spotify&#8217;s continuing investment in podcasts, Wrapped will also this year include a deeper look into users&#8217; podcast listening habits. And it will include new features, like in-app quizzes, a &#8220;Story of Your 2020&#8221; dedicated to users&#8217; top song of the year, new Wrapped badges, personalized playlists, customization options for social sharing, and other additions.</p>
<p>The feature will launch in the Spotify mobile app for iOS and Android in global markets to give users their year-end insights. But non-users will get a taste of Wrapped with a web version, where Spotify will share its broader global listening trends, including the most-streamed artist, top three podcasts, and other popular music insights.</p>

<p>Spotify on Tuesday <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-12-01/the-trends-that-shaped-streaming-in-2020/">had shared</a> some of these trends, noting that Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny had claimed the top spot with more than 8.3 billion streams in 2020. The top three podcasts, meanwhile, were The Joe Rogan Experience, TED Talks Daily and The Daily.</p>
<p>This year, podcasts got more detailed in Spotify Wrapped, as well. Though the feature had included podcast insights <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/spotify-wrapped-expands-to-include-your-favorite-music-from-the-decade-plus-podcaster-metrics/">in prior years</a>, this aspect of the experience is being expanded in 2020 to include added metrics, like how many minutes users spent listening to podcasts in 2020 and the most &#8220;binge-worthy&#8221; podcasts of the year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081043" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081043" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081043" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Podcast-binge-listen.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081043" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>A new in-app quizzes feature, meanwhile, will allow users to guess before the trends Wrapped reveals. These quizzes will let Spotify listeners guess which were their top podcasts, top artists and even what decade&#8217;s songs they streamed the most. Users will also be able to see what new genres they discovered during the year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081045" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081045" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081045" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quiz-My-Top-Artist-Share-card.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081045" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Stories, naturally, will make an appearance in this year&#8217;s Wrapped, too. The company was recently spotted as testing a Stories feature in its app &#8212; a continuation of tests Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/spotify-is-testing-its-own-version-of-stories-called-storyline/">began last year with Storylines </a>and again in January 2020, when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/spotify-test-lets-influencers-post-stories-to-introduce-their-own-playlists/">it first began to allow influencers to post Stories</a> to introduce their playlists. Now, those influencers<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-stories-playlist-test-artists-202540428.html"> also include musicians themselves</a>, according to the latest tests.</p>
<p>In Wrapped, Spotify is introducing &#8220;Story of Your 2020,&#8221; which shows your top song from the year from its first stream to its 100th stream and several milestones in between.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081048" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081048" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081048" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Top-Song-Story-of-your-song.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081048" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Premium users will gain access to new badges this year based on how they listened. Some will earn the &#8220;Tastemaker&#8221; badge, if their playlists gained followers; others will earn a &#8220;Pioneer&#8221; badge for listening to songs first, before they hit 50,000 streams. The third badge, &#8220;Collector,&#8221; will be awarded to those who added some number of songs to their playlists this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081044" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081044" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081044" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Premium-badges.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081044" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Along with Wrapped, users will get access to three new personalized playlists. One, called Your Top Songs, features users&#8217; favorite tracks from the year. Missed Hits, meanwhile, will recommend popular songs in 2020 that you didn&#8217;t listen to, but Spotify thinks you would like. And for listeners in the U.S., U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, a third playlist called On Record will introduce a mixed media experience that highlights users&#8217; top 2020 artists.</p>
<p>As always, a big part of Wrapped is the social sharing component. This year, users will be able to personalize their Wrapped sharing card by picking from among four color choices before posting it to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or Twitter.</p>
<p>2020 Wrapped arrives today on iOS and Android. Later today, Spotify will also roll out its Wrapped creator experience for <a href="http://spotifyforpodcasters.com/">podcasters</a> and <a href="http://spotifyforartists.com/">artists</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> has two new features this week. First, the company is launching a web app for its regular users — not just business users. Second, in the U.K., <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/revolut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="revolut">Revolut <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has partnered with <a href="https://www.modulrfinance.com">Modulr</a> to let you receive your salary a day early.</p>
<p>Revolut has historically focused its efforts on its mobile app. If you have a business account with Revolut, you know that you can see your past transactions and access your account from a regular web browser. But the company’s 13 million customers couldn’t access their account from a computer.</p>
<p>Everyone can now head over to <a href="https://app.revolut.com/start">Revolut’s web app</a> and sign in to view their transaction history and cards. From this interface, you can freeze and unfreeze a debit card and control card features. The web app also supports account top-ups using a bank transfer, a card payment or Apple Pay (in Safari).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By default, Revolut sends a push notification so that you can authorize web browser access. But if you’ve lost your phone, you can also choose to receive a security code via email.</p>
<p>You’ll still have to use the mobile app to access some features, but it’s a start.</p>
<p>As for users living in the U.K., Revolut is doubling down on its partnership with Modulr to send your salary a bit early. Salaries made over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BACS">Bacs payment scheme</a> will arrive a day earlier than usual — most people are paid using this method in the U.K. This is all about optimizing payment infrastructure, and it could be particularly helpful before a long holiday weekend.</p>
<p>This should also benefit Revolut directly as many users have been using Revolut in addition to a regular bank account. Adding features that make it easier to ditch your bank account could boost the company’s usage numbers. And that could help the company grow its card interchange fees, subscription revenue and other sources of revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.ju.st/en-us">Eat Just</a> will start offering lab-grown chicken meat in Singapore after gaining regulatory approval from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA). The cell-cultured chicken will eventually be produced under Eat Just’s new GOOD Meat brand through partnerships with local manufacturers and go on sale to restaurants before it is available to consumers.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">While there are plenty of other companies working on lab-grown meats using various techniques, Eat Just describes the Singapore government’s review and regulatory approval as a &#8220;world first.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">No chickens were killed to obtain the cell line used to produce Eat Just’s cultured meat, global head of communications Andrew Noyes told TechCrunch. Instead, the process starts with cell isolation, where cells are sourced through methods that can include a biopsy from a live animal. After the cells are cultured, they are transferred into a bioreactor, fed with a proprietary mix of proteins, amino acids, minerals, sugars, salts and other nutrients and then harvested after they achieve enough density.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">The company said it went through 20 productions runs of cell-cultured chicken in 1,200-liter bioreactors to prove the consistency of its manufacturing process. Eat Just also said no antibiotics were used and that its cultured chicken has an &#8220;extremely low and significantly cleaner microbiological content than conventional chicken.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Noyes said the company is already working with a restaurant to add its GOOD Meat chicken to their menu, and hopes to announce a launch date soon.</p>

<p>In Eat Just&#8217;s announcement today, chief executive officer Josh Tetrick said, &#8220;Singapore has long been a leader in innovation of all kinds, from information technology to biologics to now leading the world in building a healthier, safer food system.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The government is currently engaged in an initiative, called &#8220;30 by 30,&#8221; to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/strengthening-food-security-with-rd">produce 30% of the country’s food supply</a> locally by 2030. Spearheaded by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), the initiative was prompted because Singapore currently imports over 90% of its food, which makes it vulnerable to export bans or the logistics issues highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact. As part of &#8220;30 by 30,&#8221; the SFA and Agency for Science, Technology and Research has made $144 million SGD in research funding available.</p>
<p class="p1">Eat Just, whose other products include <a href="https://www.ju.st/en-us/products/consumer/egg/folded">a plant-based egg substitute</a>, announced last month it is partnering with Proterra Investment Partners Asia to launch a new Asian subsidiary. The partnership includes a factory in Singapore that received support from the government’s Economic Development board.</p>
<p class="p1">There are several factors driving demand for cultured meat and plant-based protein in Asian markets. The first is concerns about the safety of meat from slaughterhouses that gained momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic also highlighted vulnerabilities in the production and supply chain that can be potentially be avoided with lab-produced meat and meat alternatives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today released its highly anticipated annual list of the best apps and games of 2020. As in previous years, App Store editors selected the winners based on factors like the app&#8217;s quality, creative design, usability and use of Apple technology, among other things. The &#8220;Best of 2020&#8221; winners this year include a number of apps that helped people transition to a life spent at home. For example, home workout app Wakeout! won iPhone App of the Year, while Zoom snagged the top spot as the iPad App of the Year.</p>
<p>Disney+, which helped families keep kids entertained during coronavirus lockdowns, won for Apple TV App of the Year. The streaming service had just won &#8220;best app&#8221; in Google Play&#8217;s User Choice category, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">announced on Tuesday</a> alongside its other Play Store winners.</p>

<p>Top games of the year highlighted our collective need for escapism, often to fantasy worlds. This year, the list of game winners included Genshin Impact (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">also a Play Store &#8220;best game&#8221; winner</a>) for iPhone Game of the Year; Legends of Runeterra as iPad Game of the Year; Disco Elysium as Mac Game of the Year; Dandara Trials of Fear as Apple TV Game of the Year; and Sneaky Sasquatch as the Apple Arcade Game of the Year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, productivity app Fantastical won as Apple&#8217;s Mac App of the Year, a reflection of our new work-from-home lifestyles.</p>
<p>A relaxation and sleep app, Endel, won Apple Watch App of the Year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081433" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081433" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2081433" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081433" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Endel</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising to see another relaxation app win a top app of the year accolade. Google just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">awarded</a> sleep app, Loóna, the title of best app of 2020 on Tuesday, as well.</p>
<p>2020 has been a tough year filled with stressful events, including not only the COVID-19 pandemic, but Trump&#8217;s impeachment and November&#8217;s contentious U.S. presidential elections, the biggest stock market crash since &#8217;87, protests and riots over racial injustice, wildfires in Australia and the U.S. West, the Weinstein verdict, Brexit, the deadly Beirut explosion, violence in Delhi, the Hong Kong protests, locust swarms in East Africa and deaths of prominent figures like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Kobe Bryant Chadwick Boseman and others.</p>
<p>As Apple explained in its announcement, apps are a reflection of culture. And this year, they reflected people&#8217;s focus on self-care and mental health, remote work and learning, staying connected with family and friends, interactive and social gaming, and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081436" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081436" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2081436" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pokemon-go-app-trend-of-2020.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081436" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pokémon GO</p></div></p>
<p>Apple selected a handful of apps to reflect these &#8220;app trends,&#8221; including self-care app Shine, remote learning app Explain Everything Whiteboard, family messaging app Caribu, charitable giving app SharetheMeal and the revamped Pokémon GO, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/niantic-is-updating-pokemon-go-and-other-titles-to-support-indoor-gaming/">shifted to support indoor gaming.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;This year, more than ever before, some of our most creative and connected moments happened in apps. This was thanks to the amazing work of developers who introduced fresh, helpful app experiences throughout the year,&#8221; said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow, in a statement. &#8220;Around the world, we saw remarkable efforts from so many developers, and these Best of 2020 winners are 15 outstanding examples of that innovation,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s &#8220;Best of&#8221; winners will receive the first-ever physical App Store Best of 2020 award, featuring the App Store logo set into 100% recycled aluminum, with the winner&#8217;s name on the side.</p>
<p>Apple also unveiled the most downloaded apps and games of the year, which, unlike its &#8220;best of&#8221; editorial selections, are a showcase of real consumer demand.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, these lists included remote work must-haves like Zoom and Gmail; a number of escapist games and, not coincidentally, pandemic simulator Plague, Inc.; the viral hit Among Us! ,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/aocs-among-us-stream-topped-435000-concurrent-viewers/">which even AOC live-streamed</a>; kids&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/22/with-kids-and-adults-staying-at-home-are-virtual-worlds-ready-for-primetime/">metaverse&#8221;</a> platforms like Minecraft and Roblox; and the usual set of top social apps &#8212; this year led by TikTok, not a Facebook-owned app.</p>

Whether it’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/the-orcam-myeye-helps-visually-impaired-people-read-and-identify-things/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">robotics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/the-orcam-myeye-helps-visually-impaired-people-read-and-identify-things/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups, there’s no shortage of diverse interest with Israeli startups.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in October <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-hi-speed-iphone-event-today/">announced the MagSafe Duo</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, a folding travel charger capable of charging both the iPhone and either an Apple Watch or AirPods simultaneously/wirelessly. In an unusual move, the company didn&#8217;t specify exactly </span><em style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">when</em><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> it&#8217;d start shipping — or even when it&#8217;d go up for sale. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Some rumors suggested late December, while others were uncertain it would even make it out before the end of the year. When was this thing actually going to be released?</span></p>
<p>The answer, it seems, is today. The MagSafe Duo just appeared on Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHXF3AM/A/magsafe-duo-charger">own store</a> and, with delivery estimates as soon as this week, it looks like they&#8217;re shipping them immediately.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">TechCrunch Editor-In-Chief Matthew Panzarino gave the charger a spin </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/apple-magsafe-duo-charger-review-useful-but-expensive-and-underwhelming/">a few weeks ago</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, calling it &#8220;useful, but expensive and underwhelming,&#8221; while noting that it feels like something that should cost around $70 rather than $129.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
