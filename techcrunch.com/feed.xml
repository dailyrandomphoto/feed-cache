										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://aruna.id/">Aruna</a>’s founders first met at university, they wanted to find a way to use their studies in information technology to help family members who were running small fisheries. Indonesia is one of the world’s largest fisheries producers, but the industry is very fragmented. This means fisheries, especially small ones, deal with fluctuations in demand and price instability. Aruna was created to bring them closer to customers like restaurants and exporters, the way <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/farm-to-table/">farm-to-table startups</a> are aggregating the agricultural supply chain.</p>
<p>Aruna announced today it has raised $35 million in Series A funding led by Prosus Ventures and East Ventures Growth Fund, with participation from SIG and returning investors including AC Ventures, MDI and Vertex Ventures. Aruna says this is the largest Series A investment to date in Indonesia’s agritech and maritime sector.</p>
<p>The company works primarily with small fisheries (or ones that have boats with about one to two metric tonnes of capacity) and focuses on sustainability, helping suppliers adhere to the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">United Nations Goal 14’s targets.</a> These include preventing overfishing, protecting coastal ecosystems and giving small-scale fisheries access to more resources and markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aruna was founded in 2016 by Farid Naufal Aslam, Indraka Fadhlillah and Utari Octavianty, who met while studying information technology administration and management at Telkom University. Fadhlillah and Octavianty came from families in the fishing industry, and the three wanted to create something that would solve some of the challenges they faced.</p>
<p>“This was the main idea, but the bigger thing we saw at the time was the advantage of Indonesia’s position as a large agricultural country with big potential in the seafood industry,” Aslam told TechCrunch.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indonesian agritech platform TaniHub Group harvests a $65.5M Series B round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/indonesian-agritech-platform-tanihub-group-harvests-a-65-5m-series-b-round/embed/#?secret=pMaCTz7hcA" data-secret="pMaCTz7hcA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/30/new-initiative-to-improve-sustainability-of-indonesia-fisheries">the World Bank</a>, Indonesia is the world’s second largest fisheries producer. The sector creates about $4.1 billion in annual export earnings and supports more than 7 million jobs.</p>
<p>But Aruna’s founding team saw two major problems while analyzing coastal communities. The first one was market access and getting fair prices for seafood. The second was access to working capital.</p>
<p>To solve the first issue, Aruna was built to shorten the supply chain, which Aslam said can have six or seven layers between fisheries and buyers like restaurants, markets or exporters.</p>
<p>Buyers make purchase orders through the platform, which are then distributed to fishery communities that Aruna organizes to focus on particular types of seafood. This helps them predict demand, guarantee return business and prevent overfishing.</p>
<p>Aruna also built a logistics network that includes more than 45 collection sites, or warehouses where seafood is delivered by fisheries for quality checks, processing and packaging. Aruna’s warehouses are a combination of facilities that it owns or runs with partners. Deliveries are performed by third-party logistics providers.</p>
<p>The platform currently has about 20 product categories and will use its funding to expand into more. Its commodities include high-value products like lobster, which are shipped by exporters to markets like Malaysia, Singapore, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>One of Aruna’s main requirements for fisheries on the platform is sticking to its sustainability process. According to the World Bank, one of the biggest issues facing Indonesia fisheries is overfishing, which hurts marine biodiversity. Aruna team members work with fisheries to standardize their equipment so they comply with government regulations and chose locations that are not overfished.</p>
<p>By focusing on a few types of seafood each, fisheries that work with Aruna are better able to ensure the quality and traceability of their products, and manage pricing fluctuations.</p>
<p>The second problem Aruna is working on is lack of access to working capital. To help fisheries get low interest, collateral-free loans for equipment and other things they need for their businesses, Aruna partners with financial institutions and fintech companies. When an Aruna fishery applies for a loan, the platform is able to provide transaction data collected on the platform for credit scoring.</p>
<p>The company also announced today that it has appointed Budiman Goh as its president, and Octavianty as its chief sustainability officer. Its funding will be used to expand to new areas in Indonesia, hiring data analytics and tech development, including IoT devices to help perform quality checks.</p>
<p>Aruna plans to focus on Indonesia for the near future because of the large number of fisheries in the country.</p>
<p>“Currently we have 21,000 fishermen on the platform, yet there are about 2.7 million fishermen in Indonesia, so there is a lot of room to grow,” Aslam said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sachin Bhanot, Prosus Ventures’ head of Southeast Asia investment said, “Having built a robust supply chain and technology infrastructure steeped with deep industry knowledge and expertise, we believe Aruna is uniquely positioned to service the growing global demand for sustainable fishery product, while supporting the livelihood of local fishermen.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Extra Crunch for July 21, 2021. It’s been a good day for crypto fans, with major coins seeing some recovery from recent lows. Bitcoin and ether remain depressed on a seven-day time frame, however. And the stock market is up today. What more can we ask for on a Wednesday? Well, how about a huge run of startup and tech news? We can do that! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">Clubhouse leaves beta:</a></strong> Clubhouse, the buzzy live-audio startup that captivated the technology world earlier this year, is out of beta. The move feels a hair late given the work that Twitter has done with its Spaces product, but is welcome all the same. Data indicates that Clubhouse is having a moment in India, a key tech market as Daily Crunch has discussed ad nauseam.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">Tumblr goes pro:</a> </strong>Feeling like a comeback story? Tumblr certainly does. After winding up as part of Yahoo thanks to a $1.3 billion deal, and later part of Verizon after the company (and still TechCrunch’s parent company’s parent company) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/verizon-buys-yahoo-for-4-83-billion/#:~:text=Verizon%20%28which%20owns%20AOL%2C%20which%20owns%20TechCrunch%29%20is,includes%20Yahoo%E2%80%99s%20advertising%2C%20content%2C%20search%20and%20mobile%20activities.">bought the online portal giant</a>, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/what-will-tumblr-become-under-the-ownership-of-techs-only-goldilocks-founder/">got sold to Automattic for a song</a>. Now it wants to join the creator economy boom by allowing its users to put up paywalls. We’re here for it &#8212; the internet would be more fun with a healthy Tumblr in the mix.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/byjus-acquires-reading-platform-epic-for-500-million-in-us-expansion-push/">Byju’s comes to America:</a> </strong>Indian edtech superstar Byju’s is coming to the U.S. on the heels of its newly announced $500 million deal for Epic, what TechCrunch described as a “California-headquartered reading platform.” The edtech market is hot, something that we’ve long known. Duolingo’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">IPO is also in the mix</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/sololearn-raises-24m-for-its-bite-sized-duolingo-like-mobile-first-coding-education-app/">is a recent $24 million round for Sololearn</a>, a startup that wants to take the Duolingo model and apply it to learning to code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have lots to chat about today from the world of startups thanks to the supercharged venture capital cadence around the world. Up top, if you are keeping tabs on the Robinhood IPO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/what-robinhoods-warnings-about-crypto-trading-say-about-coinbases-near-term-future/">our latest notes are here</a>. Now, let’s talk tech upstarts and private capital, starting with some fintech updates.</p>
<h3>Fintech</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/"><strong>Lending startup Upgrade embraces crypto:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Back in 2019, TechCrunch took note of Upgrade, a consumer lending startup from LendingClub founder Renaud Laplanche. Today the startup rolled out a credit card with bitcoin rewards. If you need a few more satoshis worth of $BTC and want to build credit, this might be for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/whenthens-no-code-payments-platform-attracts-6m-from-european-vcs-stride-and-cavalry/"><strong>No-code + Payments = WhenThen:</strong></a> WhenThen’s no-code payments service is not struggling to explain itself to investors, its latest $6 million round indicates. Its service, TechCrunch reports, allows customers to “autonomously orchestrate, monitor, improve and manage all customer payments and payments ops.” The no-code element likely means it&#8217;s a bit more friendly to the non-developers out there. We grade this idea neat out of 10.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/spendesk-raises-118-million-for-its-corporate-spend-management-service/">$118M more for corporate spend management:</a> </strong>Here in the U.S., the corporate spend wars have Ramp versus Airbase versus Brex on the front lines. But that doesn’t mean that the popular model of fusing corporate cards and software to help companies manage their overall dispensation of funds is fully figured out. Especially in a global context. And now Spendesk has a fresh €100 million in its own accounts to spend taking on the EU market. I wonder what service it will use to track those costs?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/outplay-gets-7-3m-from-sequoia-capital-india-to-help-outbound-sales-team-scale-their-campaigns/"><strong>Sequoia Capital India backs Outplay:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The new $7.3 million investment will bolster the startup’s efforts to “help outbound sales teams scale their campaigns.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/spreadsheet-com-wants-to-put-apps-in-your-spreadsheet/"><strong>Say hello to what may be the future of spreadsheets:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Spreadsheet.com wants to flip the idea of turning spreadsheet usage into targeted apps on its head. Instead, the startup wants to put apps in your spreadsheets. And its general release is coming this October.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/okendo-raises-5-3m-to-help-d2c-brands-ween-themselves-off-of-big-tech-customer-data/"><strong>Aussies want to help D2C brands kick the Big Tech habit:</strong></a> Now flush with $5.3 million in new capital, Sydney-based Okendo wants to help “brands scale the quality of their first-party data and loosen their reliance on tech advertising kingpins for customer acquisition and engagement.” If they can manage that, hats off.</li>
</ul>
<p>Closing our startup coverage, a few final notes. Pangaea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/pangaea-holdings-developing-mens-personal-care-brands-raises-68m-including-minority-stake-from-eurazeo/">has raised $68 million for its men&#8217;s personal care brands</a>. That is cool. But don’t get it mixed up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/yc-backed-pangea-discusses-growth-fundraising-ahead-of-demo-day/">Providence, Rhode Island-based Pangea</a>, a recent Y Combinator grad that has some news coming up. More on that soon.</p>
<p>If you want a deeper dive into the latest in hot business books, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/how-weworks-adam-neumann-made-a-pigeon-look-like-a-swan/">Equity team recently sat down with one of the authors</a> of “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645810/the-cult-of-we-by-eliot-brown-and-maureen-farrell/">The Cult of We</a>” to chat all things WeWork.</p>
<h2>These simple metrics will tell you if your startup is ready to scale</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a temptation inside early-stage startups to claim that the go-to-market strategy is fully operational. In reality, GTM is a stark numbers game, and even with a solid plan in place, it can be easily foiled by common problems like turf battles and poor communication.</p>
<p>Finding GTM fit is a milestone for any startup that can include anything from expanding the engineering team to launching your first media buy. But how do you know when you&#8217;ve reached that magic moment?</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to consider three metrics: gross churn rate, the magic number and gross margin,&#8221; says Tae Hea Nahm, co-founder and managing director of Storm Ventures.</p>
<p>High churn means customers aren&#8217;t delighted, low gross margins mean poor unit economics, and that so-called magic number?</p>
<p>&#8220;You can calculate it by taking new ARR divided by your marketing and sales spending,&#8221; according to Nahm. &#8220;But keep in mind that the magic number is a lagging indicator, and it may take you a few quarters to see a positive result.&#8221;</p>

To entice more developer love, Amazon released a slew of new features for the service. Frankly, given the slow pace of growth in intelligence we’ve experienced with Alexa, Siri, Cortana and Google’s “OK Google” setup, we are gently skeptical.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/argo-ford-to-launch-self-driving-vehicles-on-lyfts-ride-hailing-app/">Can Ford, Argo and Lyft make self-driving taxis work?</a> </strong>Recall that Google’s Waymo taxi service both exists and operates, albeit in micro compared to the riding networks that Uber and Lyft sport. Now Ford, a car company; Argo, a self-driving concern; and Lyft, a ride-hailing effort, “plan to launch up to 1,000 self-driving vehicles on Lyft’s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin.”</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian electric vehicle charging stations are coming to yet another state park system. The EV startup said it would install its so-called &#8220;waypoint&#8221; chargers at all of Tennessee’s 56 state parks, just four months after announcing a similar agreement with the state of Colorado.</p>
<p>It’s the next step in Rivian’s plans to build out its network of more than 10,000 Level 2 AC chargers by the end of 2023. Installing chargers at state parks and other far-flung locales is a key facet of Rivian’s brand strategy: to position itself as an eco-friendly automaker for the outdoorsy type regardless of whether they own a Rivian vehicle. The waypoint chargers will be open to the public and accessible to all electric vehicle brands with a J1772 plug.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Rivian will design and install the chargers at no cost, and cover all servicing, maintenance and upgrades for 10 years. The automaker said it will also cover any needed utility upgrades associated with the charger installations — for example, improvements to electrical service panels or transformers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Rivian could start installing chargers as early as this fall. The Level 2 chargers can provide up to 11.5 kilowatts of power. That roughly translates to adding up to 25 miles of range every hour for both the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV. While waiting hours for a battery refill isn’t ideal for chargers located along highways and busy thoroughfares, Rivian says these sites will allow drivers “to top up on miles while enjoying a day trip or an overnight campout.”</p>
<p>Charging will initially be provided at no cost, though the automaker noted that future costs could be dependent on how the state decides to recover electricity costs.</p>
<p>Rivian Waypoints are separate from the company’s so-called Adventure Network, its plan to build <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/rivian-to-install-more-than-10000-ev-chargers-by-end-of-2023/">more than 3,500 DC fast chargers</a> exclusively for Rivian customers. Those chargers will be able to provide up to 140 miles of range in around 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Rivian founder RJ Scaringe has been open about his desire to develop a charging network inclusive of hard-to-reach places — a notable difference from a company like Tesla, whose proprietary network of Superchargers is located in more conventional and even high-end places.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about the opportunity to create Rivian charging locations that aren’t on the interstate, that help draw you or enable you to go to places that normally are not the kinds of places that invite or welcome electric vehicles because of charging infrastructure,” he said in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/rivian-is-building-its-own-ev-charging-network-but-with-an-adventurous-twist/">wide-ranging interview</a> with TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec. “We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how you can essentially create these curated drives where, depending on your point of interest, you can pick different paths. If you want to stop midway through the trip for a one-mile, two-mile or five-mile hike, you know, here’s a route that you want to take and here’s a charging location right next to it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As longtime TechCrunch readers know well, Michael Arrington co-founded TechCrunch and Crunchbase, as well as the venture fund CrunchFund, which was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crunchfund-rebrands-as-tuesday-capital-1528935755">later renamed</a> Tuesday Capital. But In 2017, Arrington announced that he was shifting gears and becoming a full-time crypto investor, and despite a volatile ride since, he isn&#8217;t looking back, seemingly. As he said during an interview late last week from his new home in Miami, &#8220;I like reinventing myself and I think more people should do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the heels of a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/arrington-capital-launches-100m-algorand-ecosystem-fund">new fund</a> announcement last month, we decided to catch up with Arrington to learn more about the hedge fund firm he has been building in recent years with longtime business partner Heather Harde; longtime investor-entrepreneur Ron Palmeri; and Ninor and Ninos Mansor, brothers whose crypto firm <a href="https://www.tokenpost.com/Arrington-XRP-Capital-acquires-crypto-focused-private-fund-ByteSize-Capital-1549">merged</a> with Arrington&#8217;s <a href="https://arringtonxrpcapital.com/">Arrington XRP Capital</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Our chat has been edited for length and clarity below. You can hear that longer conversation <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8877590">here</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You recently moved to Miami. Why?</strong></p>
<p>MA: I visited Miami earlier this year for the first time in a couple decades and was here just for fun on a vacation. Part of it might have been that it was one of the first times I&#8217;ve been out and social since COVID. Part of it might just be it&#8217;s actually wonderful here in the winter. I think it was February when I came. But we just fell in love with the city and got to know the mayor, got to know some people here. A lot of my friends, particularly from New York and San Francisco, had already moved here, and it just felt very welcoming. The city’s government seems to care about its citizens and wants them to be happy, or at least not explicitly trying to make them unhappy. So we came back to look at houses a couple times [and] moved here pretty quickly.</p>
<p><strong>A number of venture firms have recently relocated to Miami &#8212; is there a kind of Sand Hill Road forming anywhere?</strong></p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve learned so far is that there are three areas of Miami that people live in. The first is downtown Miami, which is very centrally located and where business gets done. Another area south of that is where all the schools are, and it&#8217;s more suburban, and that&#8217;s where we live. The last area is Miami Beach where all the fun happens.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a young entrepreneur, just trying to figure out where you&#8217;re going to make your mark, they all seem to be located downtown. A lot of the really wealthy entrepreneurs are in Miami Beach, and then people who have kids are generally down south.</p>
<p><strong>Is the process of meeting with founders any different in Miami than in California?</strong></p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m doing crypto now, it&#8217;s still a lot of Zoom meetings with Asia and Europe and Russia and all over the world. But there are a lot of in-person meetings here. I&#8217;ve already been to a few events here. It’s very much like Silicon Valley was in 2005 when I was starting TechCrunch. It&#8217;s a small community, people are very [helpful to one another].</p>
<p><strong>People who haven’t followed your career might wonder why you veered so directly into crypto when you did. </strong></p>
<p>I started it just because it was new and I like reinventing myself and I think more people should do that. I think a lot of people become very good at something, and then keep doing that, and stop exploring the world. Even though some VCs I know are multibillionaires, they just keep doing [the same thing]. And it&#8217;s like, well, you&#8217;ve made all the money, why not just explore something else?</p>
<p>My career has always been a series of reinventions. TechCrunch was one of those reinventions. So for me, this is just the next step. And I&#8217;m 50. Now, I plan on doing this right now for the rest of my career, but we&#8217;ll see in five or seven years if something else takes my fancy.</p>
<p><strong> When you <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/11/28/arrington-xrp/">announced</a> your first crypto fund, there were some twists. It was a hedge fund, not a venture fund, and it was denominated in the crypto currency XRP, created by Ripple Labs. Why hitch your wagon to XRP, and what is your relationship with Ripple exactly?</strong></p>
<p>As I was getting into crypto, I was talking to Brad Garlinghouse, who was CEO at the time, and he told me that some people had approached him about maybe doing a venture fund or a hedge fund that was funded by Ripple. And I said, ‘Well, that&#8217;s interesting, because I&#8217;m thinking about raising a fund.’ And so we explored it. Ultimately, we realized it didn&#8217;t work for tax reasons. Ripple holds a lot of XRP, and they do different things with it to try to make the ecosystem for XRP more robust, but if they were to put a sizable amount of XRP into a new fund, that&#8217;s a tax-free exchange, but as soon as a fund invests it, then that underlying XRP would be taxed at capital-gains rates based on a zero basis and it would just be a huge tax bill.</p>
<p>At that point, I started talking to some non-tax foundations about doing the exact same thing. And it does work with the foundations because they don&#8217;t have to pay taxes and gains, and so a couple of foundations in Silicon Valley contributed a relatively large amount of XRP to us for our first close. And that provided the foundation of our fund. We went from there and took other LPs who put in money, or bitcoin or whatever, but that started with them. So we owe a lot to Ripple and to XRP. And we&#8217;ve been very loyal to them.</p>
<p><strong>Why structure it as a hedge fund?</strong></p>
<p>The reason why we wanted to create a hedge fund was we wanted to be able to recycle capital indefinitely. We make private investments very much like a venture fund. But we also have a pretty large active team based in Asia, and when you&#8217;re trading the venture fund, if you buy bitcoin and then you sell bitcoin, that&#8217;s it, you&#8217;re done. You return whatever you got from the sale to investors, and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s nuance to that. Venture funds usually can recycle 25% of their capital, for example, and over time, some of the newer venture funds and crypto funds have actually gotten to the point where they can recycle indefinitely for a period of time [and] look a lot more like hedge funds. But at the time we created our fund, that wasn&#8217;t state of the art.</p>
<p><strong>Ripple has been battling with the SEC since the agency<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338"> filed a lawsuit in December</a> accusing the company of violating federal securities laws. What do you make of what’s happening?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand it. The SEC basically let Ripple do its thing for half a decade before they said anything. And it&#8217;s odd to me that at some point, on [former SEC chief] Jay Clayton’s last day in office [as he was returning last year to private practice], they filed a lawsuit. So I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s political, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s personal, I literally just don&#8217;t know. And I have no idea how this is going to come out. It hinges on whether or not XRP is a security. And that depends on securities laws that were created in the ‘40s. Frankly, I think it&#8217;s all bullshit. But who knows?</p>
<p><strong>You’ve talked openly about having a terrible year in 2018. Your fund lost a lot of its value as the broader crypto market collapsed. You narrowly avoided entering into a death spiral. Where have you made the most money as a crypto investor?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, bitcoin and ETH fell 80%. I think XRP fell 90%, something like that. We fell 42% that first year, so it was bad &#8212; 42% first year out the door is not good. But we beat the market. And so one of our main LPs actually reupped in December of 2018 and gave us another $30 million in XRP that we ended up using mostly to buy bitcoin at $3,500 and that provided a foundation of bitcoin in our fund that we hold even until today.</p>
<p>When bitcoin is doing terribly, historically it&#8217;s been a wonderful time to buy it, and that will remain true until it isn&#8217;t true anymore. So we remain very bullish in down markets and very cautious in up markets. It&#8217;s not clear to me what market we&#8217;re in right now. We think we&#8217;re in the middle of an up market with a pause here for 60 or 90 days.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think we&#8217;re in the middle of an up market?</strong></p>
<p>One of the things we look at are the derivatives markets &#8212; so people longing and shorting and there&#8217;s a bunch of interesting derivatives markets with bitcoin and ETH and others; there are these perpetual futures contracts where people are betting and you see the longs and the shorts stack up. And right now we&#8217;re seeing a lot of shorting in different ways of bitcoin. When that happens, you can have short squeezes, which tend to drive the price way up. So when the market gets super, super short, we get very, very bullish, because you can see squeezes happen and drive the price up as people are liquidated and have to buy to cover their positions. You see that all the time. It happens the other way, too. Sometimes the market gets very, very long, and you see long squeezes, and when that happens, we get nervous and we start to hedge our positions there.</p>
<p><strong>You’re watching the derivatives markets. Are you also participating in them?</strong></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t get too exotic. A lot of the really exotic stuff is on unregulated exchanges with fairly serious counter-party risk and it&#8217;s fine if you&#8217;re doing bets of $100,000. It&#8217;s definitely not fine if you&#8217;re doing bets of $30 million to $40 million at a time, which we sometimes do.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve done well by stocking up on bitcoin; where have you seen the biggest losses?</strong></p>
<p>So we&#8217;re doing some equity investments, and it’s indistinguishable from venture investing … but most of our deals are in tokens that we’re purchasing well before they&#8217;re released … these token deals tend to mature much more quickly than equity deals. Sometimes, it’s a year or two but usually it’s a much shorter time frame. We had a deal 50x this year like a month after we invested. They tend to fail faster and succeed faster. So we’ve had losses all over the place.</p>
<p>But our venture side, our losses are much smaller than they should be, so that worries me. It worries me that it&#8217;s not sustainable, because of course it isn&#8217;t, and so we were worried about that. We&#8217;re trying not to make long-term investment decisions based on short-term success. But the real losses just come in the wild swings of the market. I mean … last year, we had well over $1 billion in assets under management and that has taken a dramatic haircut in the last several weeks … it&#8217;s just part of crypto’s volatility.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve got other funds cooking. You recently announced you were <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/arrington-capital-launches-100m-algorand-ecosystem-fund">launching</a> a $100 million fund for bets on projects building on the Algorand blockchain.</strong></p>
<p>That fund is just getting its legs under it now.</p>
<p><strong>Why index so heavily on Algorand?</strong></p>
<p>Algorand is a layer-one coin, and that means it&#8217;s a network coin that has infrastructure to allow third parties to create new companies and protocols on the coin. And the founder Silvio [Micali] is literally, like, Einstein-level brilliant, and he has come up with what he thinks is a way to have your cake and eat it, too [in terms of developing a network that’s both decentralized and where transactions can happen quickly], and we believe he&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><strong>Just before we hopped on this call, Dogecoin&#8217;s founder, Jackson Palmer, published a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/dogecoin-co-creator-jackson-palmer-criticizes-the-crypto-industry.html">streak of tweets</a> in which he accuses the crypto industry of all the things that already worry people about it. He says he believes that &#8220;cryptocurrency is an inherently right wing hypercapital capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificial enforced scarcity.&#8221; Have you seen these? Do you think there&#8217;s some truth to what he&#8217;s saying here?</strong></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t looked at these specific tweets yet, but based on what you just said, I don&#8217;t disagree entirely. Crypto &#8212; Bitcoin in particular &#8212; is fundamentally anti-statist. It&#8217;s trying to rip the idea of money away from the state in the name of economic freedom, and people either agree with that or disagree with that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a libertarian and it just happens to fit my world worldview perfectly. But there are tons of statists in crypto and tax avoidance is hard. As an American, it&#8217;s pretty darn hard to avoid crypto taxes at this point, and I certainly don&#8217;t even try. I just pay the taxes and smile and go on my way. But there are a lot of people who are in crypto for the money and not for the politics of it, and that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m not sure they see the ultimate outcome of Bitcoin being what I see it as.</p>
<p>There are a lot of multibillionaires who control large parts of crypto, but I think that&#8217;s why we need to see more and more people get into crypto, so that that [wealth] gets distributed among more people as well.</p>
<p><em>[Note: Arrington’s firm just today published a <a href="https://arringtonxrpcapital.com/2021/07/19/illuminating-the-dark-age-of-blockchain-algorand/">research report</a> on Algorand. We also talked about his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/crypto-investors-like-terraform-labs-so-much-theyre-committing-150-million-to-its-ecosystem/">newest investment</a>, we discussed a separate &#8220;yield fund&#8221; he is trying to put together right now, and much more.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As phones and other consumer devices have gained feature after feature, they have also declined in how easily they can be repaired, with Apple at the head of this ignoble pack. The FTC has taken note, admitting that the agency has been lax on this front but that going forward it will prioritize what could be illegal restrictions by companies as to how consumers can repair, repurpose and reuse their own property.</p>
<p>Devices are often built today with no concessions made toward easy repair or refurbishment, or even once-routine upgrades like adding RAM or swapping out an ailing battery. While companies like Apple do often support hardware for a long time in some respects, the trade-off seems to be that if you crack your screen, the maker is your only real option to fix it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a problem for many reasons, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/massachusetts-voters-pass-a-right-to-repair-measure-giving-them-unprecedented-access-to-their-car-data/">right-to-repair</a> activist and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/ifixit-introduces-a-free-database-of-medical-repair-manuals/">iFixit founder</a> Kyle Wiens has argued indefatigably for years (the company <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/51520/ftc-unanimously-approves-policy-of-fighting-repair-restrictions">posted proudly about the statement on its blog</a>). The FTC sought comment on this topic back in 2019, issued a report on the state of things a few months ago, and now (perhaps emboldened by new chair Lina Khan&#8217;s green light to all things fearful to Big Tech companies) has issued a policy statement.</p>
<p>The gist of the unanimously approved statement is that they found that the practice of deliberately restricting repairs may have serious repercussions, especially among people who don&#8217;t have the cash to pay the Apple tax for what ought to be (and once was) a simple repair.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Commission’s report on repair restrictions explores and discusses a number of these issues and describes the hardships repair restrictions create for families and businesses. The Commission is concerned that this burden is borne more heavily by underserved communities, including communities of color and lower-income Americans. The pandemic exacerbated these effects as consumers relied more heavily on technology than ever before.</p>
<p>While unlawful repair restrictions have generally not been an enforcement priority for the Commission for a number of years, the Commission has determined that it will devote more enforcement resources to combat these practices. Accordingly, the Commission will now prioritize investigations into unlawful repair restrictions under relevant statutes&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement then makes four basic points. First, it reiterates the need for consumers and other public organizations to report and characterize what they perceive as unfair or problematic repair restrictions. The FTC doesn&#8217;t go out and spontaneously investigate companies, it generally needs a complaint to set the wheels in motion, such as people alleging that Facebook is misusing their data.</p>
<p>Second is a surprising antitrust tie-in, where the FTC says it will look at said restrictions aiming to answer whether monopolistic practices like tying and exclusionary design are in play. This could be something like refusing to allow upgrades, then charging an order of magnitude higher than market price for something like a few extra gigs of storage or RAM, or designing products in such a way that it moots competition. Or perhaps arbitrary warranty violations for doing things like removing screws or taking the device to a third party for repairs. (Of course, these would depend on establishing monopoly status or market power for the company, something the FTC has had trouble doing.)</p>
<p>More in line with the FTC&#8217;s usual commercial regulations, it will assess whether the restrictions are &#8220;unfair acts or practices,&#8221; which is a much broader and easier to meet requirement. You don&#8217;t need a monopoly to make claims of an &#8220;open standard&#8221; to be misleading, or for a hidden setting to slow the operations of third-party apps or peripherals, for instance.</p>
<p>And lastly the agency mentions that it will be working with states in its push to establish new regulations and laws. This is perhaps a reference to the pioneering &#8220;right to repair&#8221; bills like the one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/massachusetts-voters-pass-a-right-to-repair-measure-giving-them-unprecedented-access-to-their-car-data/">passed by Massachusetts last year</a>. Successes and failures along those lines will be taken into account and the feds and state policymakers will be comparing notes.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first movement in this direction by a long shot, but it is one of the plainest. Tech companies have seen the writing on the wall, and done things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/apple-expands-its-independent-repair-program-to-mac-after-us-antitrust-investigation-examined-companys-repair-policies/">expand independent repair programs</a> — but it&#8217;s arguable that these actions were taken in anticipation of the FTC&#8217;s expected shift toward establishing hard lines on the topic.</p>
<p>The FTC isn&#8217;t showing its full hand here, but it&#8217;s certainly hinting that it&#8217;s ready to play if the companies involved want to push their luck. We&#8217;ll probably know more soon once it starts ingesting consumer complaints and builds a picture of the repair landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.draftkings.com/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2F">DraftKings</a> is charging into the NFT game, announcing a marketplace aimed at curating sports and entertainment-themed digital collectibles for its audience of enthusiasts. The platform is &#8220;debuting later this summer,&#8221; and showcases another potentially lucrative expansion for the fantasy sports betting company.</p>
<p>DraftKings is entering a market that is both crowded and sparse &#8212; with plenty of NFT marketplace options for today&#8217;s niche group of collectors, though offerings are still light when considering the billions that have flowed through the space in the first several months of the year. This week, investors gave NFT marketplace OpenSea a $1.5 billion valuation. Dapper Labs, which makes NBA Top Shot, recently raised at a reported $7.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Dapper&#8217;s existing sway in the space will leave DraftKings pursuing opportunities outside exclusive league partnerships. NBA Top Shot allows players to buy &#8220;Moments&#8221; from NBA history, clips of actual game and player footage to which it has access via league and players&#8217; association partnerships. In addition to the NBA, Dapper has already partnered with other leagues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DraftKings&#8217; foothold in the space will come from an exclusive partnership with <a href="https://autograph.io/">Autograph</a>, a newly launched NFT startup co-founded by quarterback Tom Brady. The company has inked exclusive NFT deals with some top athletes, including Tiger Woods, Wayne Gretzky, Derek Jeter, Naomi Osaka and Tony Hawk, hoping to build out its platform as the hub for sports personality collectibles.</p>
<p>Aside from the partnerships, DraftKings is hoping to get a leg up in the space by further simplifying the user onboarding process, allowing users to buy NFTs without loading a wallet with cryptocurrency, instead purchasing with USD. When the platform launches, users will be able to purchase NFTs from DraftKings and resell or trade them through the platform.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/embed/#?secret=OgUogvXhpw" data-secret="OgUogvXhpw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For DraftKings, which has raised some $720 million in funding since launch in 2012, the NFT expansion could offer an opportunity of funneling their existing audience into the new vertical. Few existing tech startups have made noteworthy expansions into the NFT world despite plenty of hype and investor interest. DraftKings co-founder Matt Kalish tells TechCrunch that the startup&#8217;s devoted community is its biggest asset to winning in the rising space.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;DraftKings has millions of people in our community who show up to out-platform every day and every week,&#8221; Kalish says. &#8220;We think our biggest advantage is the strength and size of our community&#8230; [We] will bring a lot of eyeballs to the table.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla will &#8216;most likely&#8217; resume accepting bitcoin as a form of payment once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables, CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday at a virtual panel discussion hosted by the Crypto Council for Innovation, remarks that are in line with statements he made last month on Twitter.</p>
<p>Tesla started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in February, the same time that the company purchased a historic $1.5 billion in bitcoin — before reneging on its decision just three months later, citing environmental concerns.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hP1M2XvB4s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/">Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla, orders a halt to bitcoin car payments </a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla, orders a halt to bitcoin car payments &#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/embed/#?secret=hP1M2XvB4s" data-secret="hP1M2XvB4s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Cryptocurrencies get a bad rap for energy usage because they do indeed use up an awful lot of energy, at least many of them do. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the space’s two biggest currencies, use a mechanism called proof-of-work to power their networks and mint new blocks of each currency. The “work” is solving complex cryptographic problems and miners do so by stringing together high-end graphics cards to tackle these problems. Major mining centers have thousands of GPUs running around the clock.</p>
<p>While Ethereum has already committed to transitioning away from proof-of-work to something called proof-of-stake, which vastly reduces energy usage, Bitcoin seems less likely to make this transition. So, becoming “eco-friendly” likely doesn’t mean making any major underlying changes to Bitcoin, but rather shifting what energy sources are powering those mining centers.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin’s global mining network does clearly lean on renewables, it’s pretty difficult to get exact insights on what the spread of renewables usage is given how, ahem, decentralized the grid is. What is clear is that it’s going to take some unprecedented transparency from the global network to even give Musk a starting point here to judge Bitcoin’s current or future “eco-friendliness,” and in all likelihood Musk will have a lot of wiggle room to make this decision based on anecdotal data whenever he wants.</p>
<p>Today’s comments come as no surprise: He tweeted in June, “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.</p>
<p>When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1404132183254523905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p>His comments do give him plenty of wiggle room, however. “As long as there is a conscious effort to move bitcoin miners toward renewables then Tesla can support that,” he added later in the talk. A large portion of bitcoin mining was done in China, where cheap coal and hydropower made it slightly more economical; but Musk noted that some of these coal plants have been shut down (and a large portion of miners in China have started to migrate abroad, in response to mining crackdowns by the Chinese party).</p>
<p>It should also be noted that his concerns over bitcoin’s environmental impact have caused controversy in the bitcoin community, with some arguing that bitcoin receives an oversized amount of scrutiny relative to its actual energy consumption. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who also participated in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwx_7XAJ3p0&amp;ab_channel=ARKInvest">virtual panel</a>, has actually argued that bitcoin can incentivize the transition to renewable energy. A <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf">white paper</a> published by the Bitcoin Clean Energy Initiative, a program created by Square, argues that bitcoin mining could make renewables even cheaper and more economically feasible than they are today.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s comments, as ambiguous as they were, shows he still exerts considerable power over cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin price fell below $30,000 on Monday, after hitting an all-time high of over $63,000 in April. But after the billionaire founder revealed more details about his and his companies’ holdings at the virtual panel, the price rebounded.</p>
<p>In addition to personal bitcoin holdings and Tesla’s bitcoin holdings, his aerospace company SpaceX also owns bitcoin. Musk added that he also personally owns ether and (of course) dogecoin. The price for all three cryptocurrencies rose after his comments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter will test the use of Reddit-like upvote and downvote buttons as a way to better highlight the more interesting and relevant replies in a longer conversation thread. The company <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417920469265788931">announced</a> this afternoon it would begin what it&#8217;s calling a &#8220;small research experiment&#8221; that will add upvote and downvote buttons to replies, or even replace the &#8220;Like&#8221; button entirely. In some cases, the upvote and downvote buttons may be up arrows and down arrows, while in other cases they may be thumbs up and thumbs down buttons.</p>
<p>And in one group of testers, users may continue to see the &#8220;Like&#8221; button (the red heart) but will now find a downvote button alongside it. In this group, the upvote would count as a &#8220;Like,&#8221; Twitter said.</p>
<p>Twitter clarified to TechCrunch that only a small number of testers will see these options appear in their Twitter iOS app, and users&#8217; votes will not become public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company also said it&#8217;s not currently using this vote information to rank the replies at this time. (If, however, such a system ever become a public feature, that could certainly change.)</p>
<p>The goal with the test is to help Twitter to learn what sort of replies users find most relevant during their conversations, which is something Twitter has studied for some time. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/codyelam/status/1417923994678751233">Twitter user researcher Cody Elam</a>, past studies determined that users believed replies that were informative, supportive, positive and funny were the &#8220;best&#8221; types of replies. However, some of the best replies wouldn&#8217;t surface quickly enough &#8212; an issue Twitter hopes to be able to address with an upvoting and downvoting feature.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, we’re launching an experiment for voting within replies &#8212; a way to give us feedback on what replies you find most relevant.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Elam says the feature would allow users to privately voice their opinion on the replies&#8217; quality without having to publicly shame other users. Over time, this data could help Twitter to improve its conversation ranking systems.</span></p>
<p>If Twitter were to act on this information to actually rank the replies, it could make it easier and more enjoyable to read longer Twitter threads &#8212; like those that follow viral tweets, for example. But it could also help to better showcase the replies that add something informative or interesting or even just funny to a conversation, while pushing any trolling remarks down the thread.</p>
<p>Today, Twitter allows users to manually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/twitter-rolls-out-its-hide-replies-feature-to-all-users-worldwide/">hide the replies that detract from a conversation</a> by placing them behind an extra click. Perhaps, in time, it could do something similar for replies that received too many downvotes, too &#8212; like Reddit does. But none of these types of features are being tested right now, to be clear.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Twitter has shown interest in other types of engagement buttons beyond the Like and Retweet. Earlier this year, for example, Twitter was spotted surveying users about their interest in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/">a broader set of emoji-style reactions,</a> similar to what you&#8217;d find on Facebook. That feature has <a href="https://twitter.com/nima_owji/status/1411582017263767556">since been put into development</a>, it seems.</p>
<p>The same survey had also asked users how they felt about upvote and downvote buttons, in addition to emoji reactions.</p>
<p>Twitter says the test is rolling out now to a small group on iOS only.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Finding go-to-market fit (GTM) is a pivotal moment for a startup. It means you’ve found a repeatable formula for finding and winning lead that can be written into a repeatable GTM playbook. But before you scale up your sales and marketing, you should check the metrics to make sure you’re ready.</p>
<p>So, how do you know when your startup is ready to scale? I’ll help you answer this using numbers you can calculate on a napkin.</p>
<p>You have to consider three metrics — <strong>gross churn rate</strong>, the <strong>magic number</strong> and <strong>gross margin</strong>. With these, you can measure the health and profitability of your business. By combining them into a simple equation, you can get your <strong>LTV:CAC </strong>ratio (long-term customer value to customer acquisition cost), which is a measure of your business&#8217; long-term financial outlook. If the LTV:CAC is over 3, you’re ready to scale.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Whatever your particular business, it’s worth spending some time with these metrics to find realistic targets that will push LTV:CAC over 3. Otherwise, you might be in danger of running off a cliff.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Let’s unpack the three basic metrics:</p>
<p><strong>Gross churn rate (GCR) </strong>is a measure of <em>product-market fit (PMF)</em>. GCR is the percentage of recurring revenue lost from customers that didn’t renew. It answers the question: Do your customers stay with you? If your customers don’t stick with you, you haven’t found PMF.</p>
<p>GCR = Lost monthly recurring revenue / Total MRR.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>At the beginning of March, the company brought in $60,000 in MRR. By the end of the month, $15,000 worth of contracts didn’t renew.</p>
<p>GCR = $15,000 / $60,000 = 0.25, or 25% GCR.</p>

		<a href="http://www.jmstrategy.com/">Jonathan Martinez</a> is a former YouTuber, UC Berkeley alum and growth marketing nerd who's helped scale Uber, Postmates, Chime and various startups.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As we move toward a privacy-centric, less targeted future of growth marketing, the biggest lever will become creative on paid social channels such as the Facebooks of the world. The loss of attribution from our good friend iOS 14.5 has accelerated this trend, but channels have increasingly placed efforts toward automating their ad platforms.</p>
<p>Due to this, I believe that every growth marketing engine should have a proper creative testing framework in place — be it a seed-stage startup or a behemoth like Google.</p>
<p>After three years at Postmates, consulting for various startups, and most recently at Uber, I’ve seen the landscape of marketing change in a multitude of ways. However, what we’re seeing now is being orchestrated by factors out of our control, causing a dawn of shifts unlike anything I’ve seen. Creative has subsequently risen to become the most powerful lever in a paid social account.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The foundation</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to leverage the power of creative and succeed with paid social marketing, you’re thinking right. What you need is a creative testing framework: A structured and consistent way to test new creative assets.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the pieces a creative testing framework needs to be successful:</p>
<ul>
<li>A defined testing schedule.</li>
<li>A structured theme approach.</li>
<li>A channel-specific strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Creative has become the most powerful lever in a paid social account.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Testing creative should be a constant and iterative process that follows a defined testing schedule. A goal and structure can be as simple as testing five new creative assets per week. Inversely, it can be as complex as testing 60 new assets consisting of multiple themes and copy variations.</p>
<p>For a lower spending account, the creative testing should be leaner due to limited event signal and vice versa with a higher spending account. The most important aspect is that the testing continues to move the needle as you search for your next &#8220;champion&#8221; asset.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179900" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179900" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2179900" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4themes.png" alt="creating a testing schedule for different creative themes" width="1024" height="332" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4themes.png 1158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4themes.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4themes.png?resize=300,97 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4themes.png?resize=768,249 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4themes.png?resize=680,221 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4themes.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179900" class="wp-caption-text">4 themes x 3 variants per theme x 5 copy variations = 60 assets. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Martinez</p></div></p>
<p>After setting a testing schedule, define the core themes of your business and vertical rather than testing a plethora of random ideas. This applies to the creative asset as well as the copy and what the key value props are to your product or service. As you start to analyze the creative data, you&#8217;ll find it easier to decide what to double down on or cut from testing with this structure. Think of this as a wireframe that you either expand or trim throughout testing sprints.</p>
<p>For a fitness app like MyFitnessPal, it can be structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Themes (product screenshots, images of people using it, UGC testimonials, before/after images).</li>
<li>Messaging (segmented value props, promo, FUD).</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s vital to make sure you have a channel-specific approach, as each one will differ in creative best practices along with testing capabilities. What works on Facebook may not work on Snapchat or the numerous other paid social channels. Don’t be discouraged if creative between channels perform differently, although I do recommend parity testing. If you already have the creative asset for one channel, it doesn’t hurt to resize and format for the remaining channels.</p>
<h2>Determining wins</h2>
<p>Equally important to the creative is proper event selection and a statistically significant threshold to abide by throughout all testing. When selecting an event to use for creative testing, it’s not always possible to use your north-star metric depending on how high your CACs are. For example, if you’re selling a high-ticket item and the CACs are in the hundreds, it would take an enormous amount of spend to reach stat-sig on each creative asset. Instead, pick an event that’s more upper funnel and a strong indicator of a user’s likelihood of converting.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to select a percentage that stays consistent across all creative testing when deciding on which statistically significant percentage to use. As a rule of thumb, I like to use a certainty of 80%+, because it allows for enough confirmation along with the ability to make quicker decisions. A great (and free) online calculator is <a href="https://neilpatel.com/ab-testing-calculator/">Neil Patel’s A/B Testing Significance Calculator</a>.</p>
<h2>Make or break</h2>
<p>You’re scrolling through a social feed, a sleek gold pendant catches your eye, but all the messaging has is the brand name and product specifications. It hooked your attention, but what did it do to reel you in? Think about it: What are you doing to not only hook, but reel people in with “creative” — the make or break it factor in paid social growth marketing?</p>
<h2>Circumventing iOS 14.5 data loss</h2>
<p>Creative testing is only getting tougher for mobile campaigns as iOS 14.5 obfuscates user data, but that doesn’t equal impossible and simply means we need to get craftier. There are a variety of hacks that can be implemented to help gain clear insight on how creative is performing — some may not last forever and others may be timeless.</p>
<p>Amid all the privacy restrictions, we still have access to a huge population of users on Android that we should take advantage of. Instead of running all creative tests on iOS, Android can be used as a clear way to gather insights, as privacy restrictions haven’t rolled out on those devices yet. The data gathered from Android tests can then be taken directionally and applied to iOS campaigns. It’s only a matter of time until Android data is also at the mercy of data restrictions, so use this workaround to inform iOS campaigns now.</p>
<p>If running Android campaigns isn’t a viable option, another quick and easy solution is to throw up a website lead form to gauge the conversion rate from creative asset to a completed form. The user experience will certainly not be nearly as amazing as evergreen, but this can be used to gain insight for a short period of time (and small percentage of budget).</p>
<p>When crafting the lead form, think of questions that are both qualifying and would indicate someone completing your north-star event on the evergreen experience. After running people through the lead form, communications can be sent to convert them so ad dollars are being put to good use.</p>
<h2>Placing efforts by account stage</h2>
<p>The testing efforts for creative asset types should differ widely by account stage and can be broken down into three I&#8217;s: imitation, iteration, innovation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180012" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180012" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180012" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/222.png" alt="The type of creative testing should vary over time." width="700" height="634" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/222.png 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/222.png?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/222.png?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/222.png?resize=680,616 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/222.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180012" class="wp-caption-text">The type of creative testing should vary over time. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Martinez</p></div></p>
<p>The earlier an account stage, the more your creative direction should rely on what&#8217;s proven to work by other advertisers. These other advertisers have spent thousands proving performance with their assets, and you can gain strong insight from them. As time passes, you can slightly slow derivation from other advertisers while focusing on iterating on the best performers. If I had to place a percentage, 80% of the effort should be on imitation early on. Iteration will naturally gain steam as winners are deemed, and innovation will be the final, heavy-lagging prong.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that innovation can’t be attempted early on if there are great ideas, but generally, a more mature company can afford to spend heaps to validate their innovative ideas. Whether you have an in-house design team or are working with freelancers, it’ll also be much easier to spin up 50 variations than it will be to think of and design 50 different innovative assets. Imitating and iterating will make your early testing exponentially more efficient.</p>
<h2>Leveraging competitor insights</h2>
<p>Brainstorming and trying to imagine the most beautiful, eye-catching, hook-inducing creative doesn’t always happen within seconds, let alone minutes or hours. This is where utilizing competitor insights comes into play.</p>
<p>The most abundant resource is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library">Facebook Ads Library</a>, because it contains all the creative assets every advertiser is using across the platform. It always surprises me how few actually know of this free and powerful tool.</p>
<p>When browsing through competitors or best-in-class advertisers in this library, a sign of a great performing creative is how long an advertiser has been running specific assets. How does one find that? The date of when an advertiser started running their creative is stamped conveniently on each asset — this is beyond powerful. I can spend hours scanning through creative assets, and each advertiser provides even more intel and inspiration.</p>
<p>Creative should be at the top of the list as you think of where to place efforts on your paid social growth marketing. We must have a hacky mindset as data becomes more obscure, but with that mindset comes separating the winners from the losers. The types of strategies put in motion will vary over time, but what won’t vary is the importance on strong creative, the make it or break it factor to success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While direct-to-consumer growth has exploded in the past year, some brands are finding there&#8217;s still plenty of room to forge ahead in building a more direct relationship with their customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Sydney-based <a href="https://www.okendo.io/">Okendo</a> has made a splash in this world by building out a popular customer reviews systems for Shopify sellers, but it&#8217;s aiming to expand its ambitions and tackle a much bigger problem with its first outside funding &#8212; helping brands scale the quality of their first-party data and loosen their reliance on tech advertising kingpins for customer acquisition and engagement.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Most DTC brands are still very dependent on Big Tech,&#8221; CEO Matthew Goodman tells TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gathering more customer review data directly from consumers has been the first part of the puzzle, with its product that helps brands manage and showcase customer ratings, reviews, user-generated media and product questions. Moving forward Okendo is looking to help firms manage more of the web of cross-channel customer data they have, standardizing it and allowing them to give customers a more personalized experience when they shop with them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180563" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180563" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2180563 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/0.png" alt="" width="1024" height="553" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/0.png 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/0.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/0.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/0.png?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/0.png?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/0.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180563" class="wp-caption-text">via Okendo</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Merchants have goals and want to better understand their customers,&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> Goodman says. </span>&#8220;As soon as a brand reaches a certain level of scale they’re dealing with unwieldy data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goodman says that Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature and Google&#8217;s pledge to end third-party cookie tracking has pushed some brands to get more serious about scaling their own data sets to insulate themselves from any sudden movements.</p>
<p>The company needs more coin in its coffers to take on the challenge, raising their first bout of funding since launching back in 2018. They&#8217;ve raised $5.3 million in seed funding, led by Index Ventures. 2020 was a big growth year for the startup, as e-commerce spending surged and sellers looked more thoughtfully at how they were scaling. The company tripled its ARR during the year and doubled its headcount. The bootstrapped company was profitable at the time of the raise, Goodman says.</p>
<p>Today, the company boasts more than 3,500 DTC brands in the Shopify network as customers, including heavyweights like Netflix, Lego, Skims, Fanjoy and Crunchyroll. The startup is tight-lipped on what their next product launches will look like, but plans to jump into two new areas in the next 12 months, Goodman says.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I handle people ops as a consultant at several different tech startups. Many have employees on OPT or STEM OPT who didn’t get selected in this year&#8217;s H-1B lottery. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The companies want to retain these individuals, but they’re running out of options. Some companies will try again in next year’s H-1B lottery, even though they face long odds, particularly if the H-1B lottery becomes a wage-based selection process next year. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Others are looking into O-1A visas, but find that many employees don’t yet have the experience to meet the qualifications. Should we look at Canada?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Specialist in Silicon Valley</strong></p>
<p>Dear Specialist,</p>
<p>That’s what we’re all about &#8212; finding creative immigration solutions to help U.S. employers attract and retain international talent and help international talent reach their dreams of living and working in the United States.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/sophie-alcorn/">written a lot</a> on how U.S. tech startups can keep their international team members in the United States. One strategy is to <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/038-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp-course/">help the startup employees become qualified for O-1As</a>. Another is to obtain <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-how-can-i-get-an-h-1b-without-the-lottery/">unlimited H-1B visas without the lottery</a> through nonprofit programs affiliated with universities. Sometimes candidates return to school for master’s degrees that offer a work option called CPT, or curricular practical training.</p>

<p>But sometimes, companies end up deciding to move some of their international talent to Canada to work remotely. Recently, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcpavlopoulos/">Marc Pavlopoulos</a> and I discussed how to help U.S. employers and international talent on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/080-working-for-u-s-startups-from-canada-with-marc-pavlopoulos/">podcast</a>. Through his two companies, <a href="https://syndesus.com/">Syndesus</a> and <a href="https://www.path2canada.ca/">Path to Canada</a>, Pavlopoulos helps both U.S. tech employers and international tech talent when their employees or they themselves run out of immigration options in the United States. He most often assists U.S. tech employers when their current or prospective employees are not selected in the H-1B lottery.</p>
<p>Through Syndesus, a Canada-based remote employer — also known as a professional employment organization (PEO) — Pavlopoulos helps U.S. employers retain international tech workers who either no longer have visa or green card options that will enable them to remain in the United States or those who were born in India and are fed up by the decades-long wait for a U.S. green card. U.S. employers that don’t have an office in Canada can relocate these workers to Canada with the help of Syndesus, which employs these tech workers on behalf of the U.S. company, sponsoring them for a Canadian Global Talent Stream work visa.</p>
<p>Syndesus also helps U.S. tech startups without a presence in Canada find Canadian tech workers and employ them on the startup’s behalf. As an employer of record, Syndesus handles payroll, HR, healthcare, stock options and any issues related to Canadian employment law.</p>
<p>Pavlopoulos’ other company, Path to Canada, currently focuses on connecting international engineers and other tech talent working in the U.S. — including those whose <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/026-f-1-students-and-work/">OPT or STEM OPT</a> has run out — who cannot remain in the U.S. find employment in Canada, either at a Canadian company or at the Canadian office of a U.S. company. These employees get a Global Talent Stream work visa and eventually permanent residence in Canada. Pavlopoulos intends to expand Path to Canada to help tech talent from around the world live and work in Canada.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One year later, Clubhouse is finally out of beta. The company announced Wednesday that it would end its waitlist and invite system, opening up to everybody. Now, anybody can follow Clubhouse links, hop into a creator&#8217;s community or join any public event.</p>
<p>Clubhouse is also introducing a real logo that will look familiar — it&#8217;s basically a slightly altered version of the waving emoji the company already used. Clubhouse will still hold onto its app portraits, introducing a new featured icon from the Atlanta music scene to ring in the changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The invite system has been an important part of our early history,&#8221; Clubhouse founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth wrote in a blog announcement. They note that adding users in waves and integrating new users into the app&#8217;s community through Town Halls and orientation sessions helped Clubhouse grow at a healthy rate without breaking, &#8220;but we’ve always wanted Clubhouse to be open.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s trajectory has been wild, even for a hot new social app. The then invite-only platform took off during the pandemic and inspired a wave of voice-based social networking that probably still isn&#8217;t anywhere near cresting. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a> and everybody else eventually followed suit, splicing voice chat rooms and voice events into their existing platforms.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse voice chat leads a wave of spontaneous social apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/embed/#?secret=N8FEpgKTIi" data-secret="N8FEpgKTIi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Interest in Clubhouse reached a fever-pitch early this year, and the app&#8217;s rise is inextricable from the pandemic-imposed social isolation that saw people around the globe desperate for ways to feel connected as the months dragged on.</p>
<p>The world is slowly, unevenly opening up and Clubhouse is gradually changing along with it. After a long iOS-only stretch, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/clubhouse-android-app-launch/">introduced an Android app in May</a>. Now, Clubhouse says they&#8217;ve reached 10 million Clubhouse downloads in the Android app&#8217;s first two months. And earlier this month, Clubhouse introduced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/clubhouse-dms-backchannel/"> text-based chat feature called Backchannel</a> that broadened the singularly voice-centric app&#8217;s focus for the first time.</p>
<p>According to new data <a href="https://sensortower.com/">SensorTower</a> provided to TechCrunch, Clubhouse hit its high point in February at 9.6 million global downloads, up from 2.4 million the month prior. After that, things settled down a bit before perking back up in May when TikTok went live on Android through the Google Play Store. Since May, new Android users have accounted for the lion&#8217;s share of the app&#8217;s downloads. In June, Clubhouse was installed 7.7 million times across both iOS and Android — an impressive number that&#8217;s definitely in conflict with the perception that the app might not have staying power.</p>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s success is a double-edged sword. The app&#8217;s meteoric rise came as a surprise to the team, as meteoric rises often do. The social app is still a wild success by normal metrics in a landscape completely dominated by a handful of large, entrenched platforms, but it can be tricky to maintain healthy momentum after such high highs. Opening up the app to everybody should certainly help.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">New predictions indicate that tech companies committing to accessibility will reap a total of<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2021/07/01/how-10b-in-design-spending-will-soon-be-up-for-grabs-annually/?sh=4ed7ef021ea9"> $10 billion to $16 billion</a> in annual design spending across the U.S. and Canada. The surge in funds reinforces accessibility as not only an ethical priority, but a financial one, too.</p>
<p>Accessibility isn’t, like many believe, kryptonite for profits. It is a moneymaker. One, because making your product accessible adds an additional<strong> <em>multitude </em></strong>of people to your potential market. Two, because it actually optimizes your workflow by accounting for more issues beforehand. Three, because it will come back to bite you on the ass with hefty lawsuits and public exposure (read: profit and customer loss) if you ignore it. If anything, remember this: The cost of noncompliance is about <a href="https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/true-cost-compliance/">three times higher</a> than that of complying.</p>
<p>Today, we’re seeing something similar to what happened with diversity and inclusion: While many businesses used to consider D&amp;I a headache, we’ve since woken up to the fact that having a diversity of genders, ages and ethnicities has a<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2018/01/25/more-evidence-that-company-diversity-leads-to-better-profits/?sh=418483251bc7"> direct effect on the bottom lines</a> of companies. The same realization will come with accessibility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At its core, accessibility means making your product as usable as possible to the greatest number of people. The appeal and efficiency that entails correlates to higher revenue. So here’s why all businesses can achieve a high ROI from paying attention to accessibility, and how to optimize those returns.</p>
<h2>Start by making your teams aware of what they’re missing</h2>
<p>Having a training strategy in your business can <a href="https://www.ripleytraining.co.uk/blog/how-can-training-boost-your-profits/">drive your profits up</a> by nearly 50%. When educating your team about accessibility, you’re not just giving them new skills to raise productivity, you’re optimizing their workflow for the long run and fostering a healthier team culture.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Making your product accessible adds an additional multitude of people to your potential market and optimizes your workflow by accounting for more issues beforehand.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>What many teams aren’t understanding today is that accessibility simply opens a product to more users. If we don’t make our employees aware of this, they’ll continue to shy away from the word “accessibility” because they think it means being walled in by some unintelligible regulations. But when we make that process easy to digest for the whole team and create a shared language on accessibility, we make it easier to understand the ultimate goal: smarter design and development.</p>
<p>There<em> are</em> simple ways for businesses to get their heads around accessibility, from IBM’s<a href="https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/"> Equal Access Toolkit</a> to Microsoft&#8217;s<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/"> inclusive design</a> page to the <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">A11Y Project</a>. However, there has been a concerning lack of access to free accessibility resources, which is a key issue that our wider community is <a href="https://www.getstark.co/library/resources">trying to change</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s get into the specifics: Through awareness and training, you will start convincing your team about the importance of accessibility so they can commit to it wholeheartedly, not only for the sake of users but because it will improve their own work experience. Working with accessibility in mind makes employees’ work processes more efficient and reduces the cost of errors happening down the line. Moreover, managers will expend fewer resources supervising work to make sure it&#8217;s compliant or reworking designs that don’t meet the mark.</p>
<p>Employees will understand the needs of customers far more if they’re made aware of the varied ways different people interact with a product. We’re not talking about a statistically insignificant group: People with disabilities are the largest minority in the United States.<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html#:~:text=61%20million%20adults%20in%20the,is%20highest%20in%20the%20South."> One in four</a> U.S. adults suffer from a disability, and globally, we’re talking about<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability#:~:text=Results-,One%20billion%20people%2C%20or%2015%25%20of%20the%20world's%20population%2C,million%20people%2C%20experience%20significant%20disabilities."> 1 billion</a> people &#8212; but far more when you account for the many individuals who can’t or won’t go to the doctor or aren’t diagnosed at all. You’ve probably experienced this, too. Temporary disabilities — like having your arm in a cast for a couple of months or recovering from a serious operation — will affect your ability to use certain products if they haven’t been made with you in mind.</p>
<p>Finally, providing this conscious training lets your staff know you are open to having conversations on how to improve work conditions and culture. A happy team is a more resilient team that will stick with you on your product journey, avoiding the costs of recruiting new hires.</p>
<h2>Better testing, better efficiency</h2>
<p>As your product grows, it becomes less and less malleable. It’s harder to fix the first row of bricks on a new house if you’re already building the second and third stories.</p>
<p>That’s why we need to rethink testing. Continuously trying out your product will tell you what needs tweaking as you advance. The problem is, people with disabilities are being excluded from the testing process. And even when they do appear in data sets, their data are often <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/flawed-data-is-putting-people-with-disabilities-at-risk/">treated as anomalies</a> because they don’t follow the patterns we’re used to seeing from able-bodied people.</p>
<p>Fixing this starts with how we envision our target market. Do you have people with disabilities — and that includes the<a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170605-the-hidden-challenges-of-invisible-disabilities"> invisible ones</a> — in your target user base? As part of your personality profiles? In other words, are you reaching out to and including them, or are they more of a bycatch you don’t expect to see using your product?</p>
<p>Then test for qualitative as well as quantitative input. Get diverse users into the “office,” ask them how they feel about navigating your product. Did it take them time to learn how a certain feature worked? Was something a complete roadblock? We need to understand how they interact with your software as much as the data coming in on retention and time spent per visit.</p>
<p>This has a direct impact on your bottom line. Compliance issues cause a world of pain further on in your journey, when you’re paying <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/21/beyonce-lawsuit-website-ada-compliant/">hefty fines</a> and rebuilding core elements of your product. Lawsuits against allegedly inaccessible websites are rising, and last year <a href="https://www.adatitleiii.com/2021/04/federal-website-accessibility-lawsuits-increased-in-2020-despite-mid-year-pandemic-lull/">over 2,500</a> were filed.</p>
<p>With more accurate testing, your processes will become more efficient because you’re understanding where and when in your product lifecycle you need to insert tools and make changes. Essentially, you’ll optimize your workflow. You’ll advance in a straight line as you iterate, rather than having to pause production to go back and make adaptations as and when you realize they’re needed. You’ll launch and get your product into consumers’ hands faster.</p>
<p>Ideally, you’ll be testing within a diverse community that is personally invested in your product’s success — that will give you quicker and more detailed feedback loops.</p>
<h2>Create an internal accessibility team</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s job to understand accessibility. However, there will always be people who are specifically focused on ensuring product design, development and marketing initiatives are met.</p>
<p>This group of people should be responsible for upskilling others about accessibility and being the go-to for inclusive design. A company of a few hundred people could assign the task to about 10 people. But at an early-stage startup, it is not enough to just put one or two people on the job. Making accessibility a core part of design and development needs to be baked into the wider culture for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Your long-term returns on assigning a few people to carry out the process accurately will always be higher than the initial expense. Those people will ensure each team is working optimally for all of its users and in sync with one another, rather than wasting valuable time working to lower standards.</p>
<p>It’s better to keep this special team in-house not only to save money but because these are people who already eat, sleep and breathe your product. When bringing in outsiders, whether or not they’re experts, there will always be something of a gap between what they need to know to help and how much you can give as a company. That means any issues that in-house team members aren’t yet aware of, or can’t yet conceptualize, will probably remain unaddressed.</p>
<h2>Be smart about how you allocate your budget</h2>
<p>You can’t think in the short term when you decide where to put your money. Today’s businesses are designed to steer budgets toward the most tangible and immediate returns. Yet pouring cash into growing fast and furiously, selling quick and cashing in, simply isn’t that simple. Companies won’t buy a product that’s flawed. Brands don’t hold up when there’s little thought going into the product and who’s using it. Consumers won’t fall in love with you.</p>
<p>Strong business leaders will see that there is a time horizon to any investment. Inclusive design is both a cost-saving model and a profit builder, but you won’t see that from one day to the next. You’ll see that when users come to you that you wouldn’t have reached otherwise, and when you avoid the pitfalls that can not only cost, but take down, a company.</p>
<p>So allocate an accessibility budget alongside the product roadmap, from start to finish, taking into account purchasing specialized tools, educating your team and spending time designing your testing strategy, among other things. Set deadlines for accomplishing each goal, and allocate separate resources and timelines per process &#8212; it’s better to start with quick wins on newer projects so your team can see and feel the reward, then repeat. You may be spending more at the start as you educate your team, design your testing strategy or purchase specialized tools.</p>
<p>What you don’t want to see in your company is the accessibility conversation, budget and action plan concentrated toward the end of your product development journey. By then, it will be more about fixing what’s wrong than getting it right, at greater cost to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is giving its Alexa voice platform a shot in the arm after seeing <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2020/10/25/amazon-alexa-skill-growth-has-slowed-further-in-2020/">further declines in skill growth</a> over the past year, indicating lagging interest from third-party voice app developers. At the company&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-live">Alexa Live developer event</a> today, the company announced a slew of new features and tools for the developer community &#8212; its largest release of new tools to date, in fact. Among the new releases are those to encourage Alexa device owners to discover and engage with Alexa skills, new tools for making money from skills and other updates that will push customers to again make Alexa more a part of their daily routines.</p>
<p>The retailer&#8217;s hopes for Alexa as a voice shopping platform <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-reality-behind-voice-shopping-hype">may have not panned out</a> as it had hoped, as only a sliver of Alexa customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/shopping-via-smart-speakers-is-not-taking-off-report-suggests/">actually made</a> Amazon.com purchases through the smart speakers. However, the larger Alexa footprint and developer community remains fairly sizable, Amazon said today, noting there are &#8220;millions&#8221; of Alexa devices used &#8220;billions of times&#8221; every week, and over 900,000 registered developers who have published over 130,000 Alexa skills.</p>
<p>Still, Amazon hasn&#8217;t yet solved the challenge of helping customers find and discover skills they want to use &#8212; something that&#8217;s been historically difficult on voice-only devices. That&#8217;s improved somewhat with the launch of Alexa devices with screens, like the Alexa Show, which offers a visual component.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But largely, Alexa device owners <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/purchases-via-smart-speakers-are-not-taking-off">continue to use its most basic functions</a> &#8212; smart home control, playing music, setting alarms and reminders, making lists and other simple queries. It has yet to produce what would be considered, by most,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-11/amazon-s-alexa-has-80-000-apps-and-no-runaway-hit?sref=gni836kR"> a &#8220;runaway hit&#8221; voice app. </a></p>

<p>In an attempt to tackle this problem with more features, Amazon says it will introduce a way for developers to create Widgets for their skills, which customers can then add to their Echo Show or other Alexa device with a screen sometime later this year. Developers will also be able to build Featured Skill Cards to promote their skills in the home screen rotation.</p>
<p>In other words, Amazon&#8217;s solution is to make Alexa more like a mobile device in terms of app discovery. While perhaps useful to those who have Alexa devices with screens, that doesn&#8217;t bode well for Alexa&#8217;s future as a voice-only platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for voice-only devices, developers will now be able to have their skill suggested when Alexa responds to common requests, like &#8220;Alexa, tell me a story,&#8221; &#8220;Alexa, let&#8217;s play a game,&#8221; or &#8220;Alexa, I need a workout,&#8221; among others. And Alexa will begin to offer personalized skill suggestions based on customers&#8217; use of similar skills, while new &#8220;contextual discovery&#8221; mechanisms will allow customers to use natural language and phrases to accomplish tasks across skills. Of course, Amazon has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/amazon-alexa-now-responds-to-certain-questions-with-skills-that-can-help-you-when-alexa-cant/">tried other ways of suggesting skills before now</a>, but those impacts have been negligible on the larger skill ecosystem. (<a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/amazon-echo-how-to-turn-off-alexas-unwanted-by-the-way-suggestions/">Some efforts even annoyed users</a>.)</p>
<p>Amazon also said it&#8217;s expanding the ways developers can get paid for their skills.</p>
<p>Already, it offers tools like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/alexa-skills-can-now-offer-one-time-use-purchases-like-in-game-hints-or-points/">consumables</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/amazon-introduces-subscriptions-for-alexa-skills-makes-them-free-for-prime-members/">paid subscriptions</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/alexa-in-skill-purchasing-which-lets-developers-make-money-from-voice-apps-launches-internationally/">in-skill purchases.</a> Now, it will add support for Paid Skills, a new in-skill purchase that allows customers to pay a one-time fee to access the content a skill provides. It will also now expand in-skill purchases to India and Canada.</p>
<p>So far, in-skill purchases have yet to drive significant revenue. A <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-learns-a-new-skill-making-money-from-alexa">2019 report</a> found that Alexa skill revenue in the first 10 months of the year was only $1.4 million,<a href="https://voicebot.ai/2019/12/16/amazon-brings-in-1-4-million-in-2019-of-alexa-skill-revenue-so-far-well-short-of-the-5-5-million-target-according-to-the-information/"> far short</a> of Amazon&#8217;s $5.5 million target. It&#8217;s uncertain that one more way to make a purchase will change that trend.</p>
<p>Amazon didn&#8217;t speak to how much its developers made, instead saying only that developer revenue from in-skill purchases had &#8220;more than doubled&#8221; year-over-year.</p>
<p>Amazon will now attempt to leverage the developer community to drive sales on its retail site, too.</p>
<p>With new &#8220;Shopping Actions,&#8221; developers can sell Amazon products in their skill. For example, a role-playing game could suggest customers buy the tabletop version, as sci-fi game <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paizo-Alexa-Games-Starfinder/dp/B082SZRSRJ">Starfinder</a> does. Developers can also now earn affiliate revenue on their product referrals.</p>
<p>Music and media skill developers will be able to use new tools for more entertaining experiences, like a Song Request Skill that DJs can use to take song requests via Alexa, which <a href="https://www.iheartradio.ca/apps-en/Amazon-Alexa">iHeartRadio</a> will adopt. Others will shorten the time it takes for Radio, Podcast and Music providers to launch interactive experiences.</p>
<p>Other new features aim to make skills more practical and useful.</p>

<p>For example, restaurants will gain access to a Food Skill API that will allow them to create pickup and delivery order experiences. A new &#8220;Send to Phone&#8221; feature will allow developers to connect their skill with mobile devices, and new event-based triggers and proactive suggestions will enable new experiences &#8212; like a skill that reminds users to lock their home when they are leaving. Amazon-owned Whole Foods will use these features for a curbside pickup experience arriving later this year, the company says.</p>
<p>Alexa replenishment support, which allows customers to reorder common household items like laundry detergent or batteries, will also expand to replacement parts to better tie in with other sorts of household and smart home devices. Thermostat makers Carrier and Resideo will use this to replenish air filters and Bissell will use this with its vacuum cleaners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, safety device makers &#8212; like smoke, carbon-monoxide and water leak detectors &#8212; will be able to tie into Alexa&#8217;s security system, Alexa Guard, to send notifications to mobile devices.</p>
<p>Amazon is also introducing a set of new tools that make creating skills easier for developers, including the ability to use Alexa Entities, which is basically Amazon&#8217;s own set of general, Wikipedia-like knowledge. They&#8217;ll also gain access to new tools to aid with custom pronunciations, plus the previously U.S.-only <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/conversations/about-alexa-conversations.html">Alexa Conversations nature language feature</a> (now in beta in Germany, developer preview in Japan and live all English locales). A longer list of tools focus on regional expansions of existing toolkits (i.e. AVS, ACK), and others that enable better interoperability with smart home devices &#8212; like those that allow for unique wake words, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.upgrade.com">Upgrade</a> is launching a new credit card today. The Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card is a classic Visa credit card that works across the Visa network. But you get 1.5% in bitcoin rewards when you make payments.</p>
<p>Upgrade isn’t the first company to announce a credit card with bitcoin rewards — but it’s the first one that is generally available. If your application is approved, you can start using the virtual card immediately.</p>
<p>BlockFi announced its own credit card with bitcoin rewards in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-announces-early-2021-launch-for-bitcoin-rewards-credit-card">December 2020</a>. Gemini <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/gemini-is-launching-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/">followed suit</a> quickly thereafter. But those cards are still not generally available. A couple of weeks ago, BlockFi started <a href="https://blockfi.com/new-features-for-the-blockfi-rewards-visa-signature-credit-card">inviting people</a> on its waitlist. So a general rollout should come sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>As for the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card, the company offers credit lines from $500 to $25,000 depending on your credit score. It works with Apple Pay and Google Pay. Like other Upgrade credit cards, there are no monthly fees, late fees or returned payment fees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180465" style="width: 199px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180465" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2180465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?w=189" alt="" width="189" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg 1160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=94,150 94w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=189,300 189w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=768,1222 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=428,680 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=966,1536 966w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/UCBitcoin_Black_HR.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Upgrade</p></div></p>
<p>Essentially, this new card works pretty much like Upgrade’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/upgrade-adds-rewards-program-to-its-credit-card/">existing credit card</a>. But instead of getting 1.5% cash back on all purchases, you get 1.5% back in bitcoin — there’s no specific category, no partner retailer, no point system. It’s a straightforward, uncapped cash back program.</p>
<p>While you get rates that range between 8.99% and 29.99%, Upgrade encourages you to combine monthly charges into installment plans that you can pay back over 24 to 60 months. Once you’ve done that, you pay equal monthly payments at a fixed rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upgrade Card is already delivering over $3 billion in annualized credit to consumers,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Renaud Laplanche said in a statement. &#8220;Starting today, anyone can apply for an Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card and enjoy the same affordable and responsible credit as with any Upgrade Card, plus the potential upside and fun of owning bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has partnered with <a href="https://nydig.com">NYDIG</a> for the bitcoin rewards. Right now, you can’t do much with your bitcoins. You can choose to hold them or sell them. There’s no way to transfer your bitcoins to another wallet for instance. If you choose to sell your rewards, there’s a 1.5% transaction fee.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that this card isn’t available in all 50 states. Customers in Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia can’t order a Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card at the moment.</p>
<p>Once again, Upgrade is diversifying its portfolio of products as a top-of-the-funnel strategy. By diversifying its credit card offering, it’ll lead to more personal loans down the road.</p>
<p>To be fair, Upgrade encourages you to pay down your debt as you receive your rewards when you make your monthly balance payments. But Upgrade wants to own the customer relationship so that you’ll think about them whenever you need a personal loan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The payments space &#8212; amazingly &#8212; remains up for grabs for startups. Yes, dear reader, despite the success of Stripe, there seems to be a new payments startup virtually every other day. It’s a mess out there! The accelerated growth of e-commerce due to the pandemic means payments are now a booming space. And here comes another one, with a twist.</p>
<p><a href="https://whenthen.com/">WhenThen</a> has built a no-code payment operations platform that, they claim, streamlines the payment processes “of merchants of any kind”.  It says its platform can autonomously orchestrate, monitor, improve and manage all customer payments and payments ops.</p>
<p>The startup’s opportunity has arisen because service providers across different verticals increasingly want to get into open banking and provide their own payment solutions and financial services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded six months ago, WhenThen has now raised $6 million, backed by European VCs Stride and Cavalry.</p>
<p>The founders, Kirk Donohoe, Eamon Doyle and Dave Brown, are three former Mastercard Payment veterans.</p>
<p>Based out of Dublin, CEO Donohoe told me: “We see traditional businesses embracing e-comm, and e-comm merchants now operating multiple business models such as trade supply, marketplace, subscription, and more. There is no platform that makes it easy for such businesses to create and operate multiple payment flows to support multiple business models in one place &#8212; that&#8217;s where we step in.”</p>
<p>He added: “WhenThen is helping e-commerce digital platforms build advanced payment flows and payment automation, in minutes as opposed to months. When you start to integrate different payment methods, different payment gateways, how you want the payment to move from collection through to payout gets very, very complex. I’ve been doing this for over a decade now, as an entrepreneur building different businesses that had to accept, collect and pay payments.”</p>
<p>He said his founding team “had to build very complex payment flows for large merchants, airlines, hotels, issuers, and we just found it was ridiculous that you have to continue to do the same thing over and over again. So we decided to come up with WhenThen as a better way to be able to help you build those flows in minutes.”</p>
<p>Claude Ritter, managing partner at Cavalry, said: “Basic payment orchestration platforms have been around for some time, focusing mostly on maximizing payment acceptance by optimizing routing. WhenThen provides the first end-to-end payment flow platform to equip businesses with the opportunity to control every stage of the payment flow from payment intent to payout.”</p>
<p>WhenThen supports a wide range of popular payment providers such as Stripe, Braintree, Adyen, Authorize.net, Checkout.com, etc., and a variety of alternative and locally preferred payment methods such as Klarna Affirm, PayPal and BitPay.</p>
<p>&#8220;For brave merchants considering global reach and operating multiple business models concurrently, I believe choosing the right payment ops platform will become as important as choosing the right e-commerce platform. Building your entire e-comm experience tightly coupled to a single payment processor is a hard correction to make down the line &#8212; you need a payment flow platform like WhenThen&#8221;, added Fred Destin, founder of Stride.VC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Outbound sales managers typically rely on high volumes of inquiries to find customers, but this means that their revenue is often in proportion to the size of their team. <a href="https://www.outplayhq.com/">Outplay</a> helps them scale more easily with tools that automate campaigns, identifies the likeliest prospects and uses data to decide the right time to send pitches. The company announced today it has raised $7.3 million in seed funding from Sequoia Capital India.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used for tech development and hiring, and brings Outplay’s total raised so far to $9.3 million. Its previous funding was a $2 million raise from Sequoia Capital India’s Surge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/sequoia-capital-indias-surge-invests-2m-in-sales-engagement-platform-outplay/">announced in March</a> after Outplay took part in the program’s fourth cohort.</p>
<p>Since its seed round, Outplay says it has grown its revenue four times and now has customers in more than 50 countries, serving primarily B2B software companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Outplay was founded in 2019 by brothers Ram and Lax Papineni. The two previously<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/12/appvirality/"> launched AppVirality</a>, a referral marketing tool for app developers.</p>

<p>Outplay was designed for sales team who contact prospects through multiple channels, like phone calls, emails, SMS, LinkedIn and Twitter. It integrates the channels into one interface, so salespeople don’t have to switch between apps. Outplay also automates sequences, or marketing campaigns that include an initial pitch sent through various channels and automatic follow-up messages if a reply isn’t received within a pre-set time.</p>
<p>The platform is meant to replace the process of cold-calling potential customers, which is time-consuming and difficult to scale, and enable salespeople to focus on the best prospects, helping them decide what channel to use and when to contact them.</p>
<p>Since its seed funding, Outplay has launched several new tools and features, including a Chrome extension that lets salespeople add prospects from LinkedIn and Gmail, send emails, make calls and perform other tasks without having to visit Outplay’s dashboard. It also added integrations with sales tools like Gong, Dynamics CRM and Zapier (Outplay was already integrated with customer relationship management platforms Pipedrive, Salesforce and Hubspot).</p>
<p>One major new feature is Magic Outbound Chat, a web chat box that is launched when a prospective customer clicks on an email link. Salespeople are notified and provided with context about the prospect. Laxman told TechCrunch that most chat boxes are designed for inbound sales teams, and Magic Outbound Chat has helped some of its teams grow their sales pipeline by 300%.</p>
<p>Laxman said that the onboarding process for Outplay takes just a few days and sales managers are provided with a playbook of successful sequences to help them get started.</p>
<p>Outplay’s competitors include unicorns <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/outreach-nabs-50m-at-a-1-33b-valuation-for-its-sales-engagement-tools/">Outreach</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/atlantas-salesloft-raises-100m-for-its-digital-sales-platform-now-valued-at-1-1b/">SalesLoft</a>. Laxman said that in the mid-2000s, inbound sales processes and tech began rapidly evolving as SaaS adoption increased, but outbound sales teams still relied on the same high-volume tactics they had been using for years.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Outreach nabs $50M at a $1.33B valuation for software that helps with sales engagement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/outreach-nabs-50m-at-a-1-33b-valuation-for-its-sales-engagement-tools/embed/#?secret=aUr3g13CKr" data-secret="aUr3g13CKr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“The previous outbound sales tech disruption happened in 2011 when Outreach and Salesloft were founded. We really respect what they have done to the industry, but the approach is not scalable and the revenue eventually becomes a function of the size of the outbound sales team,” he said, adding that Outplay is changing the process by using data-driven signals to help sales representatives engage with the likeliest prospects at the right time in the right channel.</p>
<p>For example, Outplay’s Dynamic Sequencing automatically moves prospects from one sequence to another one that has a higher chance of success. In one scenario, Outplay can be configured to move a prospective who opens a sales representative’s email more than four times to another sequence that focuses on people who appear interested in a product. Laxman said some of its customers have seen open rates as high as 80% in the second sequence with Dynamic Sequencing.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sequoia India principal Harshjit Sethi said, “Outbound sales needs are evolving rapidly and reps now need personalized, automated and contextual tools to drive sales which Outplay is successfully enabling. Sales reps spend an average of four hours per day on Outplay, demonstrating the effectiveness of the product which has category-leading customer reviews.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One thing seems certain: The past year-and-a-half has fundamentally transformed the world of live events. The pandemic left plenty of venues scrambling for alternative revenue streams and, in many cases, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9451748/venues-closing-coronavirus-america-list/">shutting down for good.</a></p>
<p>On the flip side, it’s been a massive driver for those companies working to expand the reach of in-person events. Take LiveControl, which just raised a $30 million Series A led by Coatue and featuring existing investors First Round Capital, Box Group, Susa Ventures and TriplePoint. The round brings the So Cal company’s total funding to $33 million, on the heels of a $3.2 million seed led by FRC last August.</p>
<p>The company offers a production suite that’s a sort of plug and play solution for venues. “What if you could snap your fingers and an entire video product crew would appear, for just $150?” CEO Patrick Coyne asked, extremely rhetorically in a comment offered to TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180090" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180090" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180090" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180090" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LiveControl</p></div></p>
<p>LiveControl says its technology has been deployed in “hundreds” of spots in the U.S., everywhere from music venues and comedy clubs to Broadway theaters and religious institutions. With its device agnostic software and support, the company also provides third-party camera hardware as part of a package, for a more out-of-the-box solution.</p>
<p>The latest funding round will go toward accelerating its technology and expanding employee headcount from 40 people to 120 over the next year and a half. LiveControl and its investors are clearly bullish on the possibilities here. But there remain broader questions around how much audience members’ interest in remote viewing regresses to the mean once venues reopen across the country and world.</p>
<p>“Video is now table stakes for most organizations, venues and creators,” says Coyne. “We’re only seeing it accelerate, and everyone is forward leaning to make bigger investments to improve their video quality.”</p>
