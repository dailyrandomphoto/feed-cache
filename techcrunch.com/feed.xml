										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars is investigating a cybersecurity breach and theft of a limited amount of the company&#8217;s research and development data. The data breach was reported Friday by the Swedish automaker.</p>
<p>The company said one of its file repositories had been illegally accessed by a third party. Investigations have revealed that a &#8220;limited amount of the company&#8217;s R&amp;D property has been stolen during the intrusion,&#8221; the company said in a statement Friday.</p>
<p>Despite the limited amount, there may be an impact on the company&#8217;s operation, Volvo Cars said. without providing more details on the size of the breach or what was stolen. A Volvo spokesperson also declined to provide more information.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246123" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is working with an independent third-party researcher to investigate the property theft.</p>
<p>Volvo said it implemented security countermeasures, including steps to prevent further access to its property and notified relevant authorities after it detected the unauthorized access.</p>
<p>It appears that the theft was targeting company R&amp;D data, not customer information. Volvo said it &#8220;does not see, with currently available information, that this has an impact on the safety or security of its customers&#8217; cars or their personal data.&#8221;</p>
<p>A report released in fall 2021 by <a href="https://discover.cybelangel.com/autoreport/?utm_source=Press+-+USA&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=Auto+Report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital risk protection company CybelAngel</a> found that the automotive industry is at severe risk of ransomware attacks due to the availability of hundreds of thousands of exposed credentials online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s six-month investigation of automotive companies found that<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> highly sensitive information was leaked, including trade secrets, personally identifiable information, blueprints of engines and production facilities, confidential agreements, human resources documents and more. The company concluded that the these leaks occurred due to employee internal threats and external security weaknesses across the automotive supply chain.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today’s high-growth technology companies rely on millions of presales professionals, also known as sales engineers and solution consultants, to explain the value of technologies to buyers and customers. Ultimately, the contributions of these trusted technical advisers help close sales.</p>
<p>But while the C-suite acknowledges presales as a necessary supporting function to sales, executives don’t look to presales when they want to yield more growth.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			In each scenario, the incremental revenue impact can be exponential as the number of presales professionals to sales representatives grows.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Instead, the chief revenue officer (CRO), who typically oversees the presales organization, will often try to brute-force growth by adding more sales reps. That’s one way, but there are other approaches, especially in a market where finding talent has its own challenges.</p>
<p>An alternative solution may lie in presales. According to a McKinsey &amp; Company survey, investing in presales can improve conversion rates by five points, raise revenue by 6%-13% and accelerate sales by 10%-20%.</p>
<p>Rather than adding more headcount, the CRO can try something different — the presales force multiplier effect — to boost revenue.</p>
<p>To illustrate this concept, let’s examine three scenarios to quantify the impact of presales on growth.</p>
<h2>Scenario 1: High volume, low contract value</h2>
<p>Revenue models that have a high volume of transactions with corresponding low annual contract values (ACVs), say $10,000 to $50,000, can commonly have a presales-to-sales ratio of 10:1. If each sales representative has an annual quota of $750,000, this implies that one presales professional can have an annual quota influence of $7.5 million across all 10 sales representatives.</p>
<p>If a presales professional&#8217;s productivity were to increase 5% across the $7.5 million top-line influence, it could result in $375,000 ($7.5 million * 5%) incremental revenue without the need for additional headcount.</p>
<h2>Scenario 2: Medium volume, medium contract value</h2>
<p>Envision a model where ACVs could range from $51,000 to $100,000 and the presales-to-sales ratio is 5:1. If each sales representative has an annual quota of $900,000, this implies that one presales professional can have an annual quota influence of $4.5 million across all five sales representatives. If one presales professional&#8217;s productivity were to increase by 10% across the $4.5 million top-line influence, it could result in $450,000 ($4.5 million * 10%) incremental revenue without adding to the headcount.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of popular services, including Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/icloud/">iCloud</a>, Twitter, Cloudflare, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/minecraft/">Minecraft</a> and Steam, are reportedly vulnerable to a zero-day exploit affecting a popular Java logging library.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, dubbed &#8220;Log4Shell&#8221; by researchers at LunaSec and credited to Chen Zhaojun of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/alibaba/">Alibaba</a>, has been found in Apache Log4j, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/open-source/">open source</a> logging utility that&#8217;s used in a huge number of apps, websites and services. Log4Shell was first discovered in Microsoft-owned Minecraft, though LunaSec warns that “many, many services” are vulnerable to this exploit due to Log4j’s “ubiquitous” presence in almost all major Java-based enterprise apps and servers. In a <a href="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, the cybersecurity company warned that anybody using Apache Struts is &#8220;likely vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies with servers <a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be vulnerable to Log4Shell attack so far include Apple, Amazon, Cloudflare, Twitter, Steam, Baidu, NetEase, Tencent and Elastic, though there are likely hundreds if not thousands of other organizations affected. None of the companies affected by the flaw have yet responded to our request for comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246069" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Robert Joyce, the director of Cybersecurity at the NSA, <a href="https://twitter.com/NSA_CSDirector/status/1469305071116636167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that GHIDRA,</a> a free and open source reverse engineering tool developed by the agency, is also affected: “The Log4j vulnerability is a significant threat for exploitation due to the widespread inclusion in software frameworks, even NSA’s GHIDRA,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cert.govt.nz/it-specialists/advisories/log4j-rce-0-day-actively-exploited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Emergency Response Team</a> (CERT) for New Zealand, <a href="https://twitter.com/DTCERT/status/1469258597930614787" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s CERT</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata/status/1469144854672379905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greynoise</a> web monitoring service have all warned that attackers are actively looking for servers vulnerable to Log4Shell attacks. According to the latter, According to the latter, around 100 distinct hosts <a href="https://twitter.com/GreyNoiseIO/status/1469326260803416073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are scanning</a> the internet for ways to exploit Log4j vulnerability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Kayla Underkoffler, a senior security technologist at HackerOne, tells TechCrunch that this zero-day highlights the “threat that open source software presents as a growing portion of the world’s critical supply chain attack surfaces.”</p>
<p>“Open source software is behind nearly all modern digital infrastructure, with the average application using 528 different open source components,” Underkoffler said. “The majority of high-risk open source vulnerabilities discovered in 2020 have also existed in code for more than two years and most organizations lack direct control over open source software within supply chains to easily fix these weaknesses. Securing this often poorly funded software is imperative for any organization that relies on it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation has released an emergency security update today to patch the zero-day vulnerability in Log4j, along with mitigation steps for those unable to update immediately. Game developer Mojang Studios has also released an emergency Minecraft security update to address the bug.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe, long viewed as a relative backwater to the U.S. startup market, has been on a tear in recent quarters and years. Akin to many startup markets around the world, Europe has seen its venture capital totals rise, its unicorn ranks swell, and even a few major public exits.</p>
<p>How hot is the market for European startups this year? This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/flink-the-berlin-based-instant-grocery-startup-is-now-valued-at-2-85b-after-raising-750m-in-a-round-led-by-doordash/">morning, TechCrunch reported</a> that Flink raised $750 million. The “Berlin-based startup that sells food and other essentials at supermarket prices and aims to deliver them in under 10 minutes,” as we described it, is now worth $2.85 billion. And unless you are very familiar with the instant grocery market, we doubt that you were too aware of Flink.</p>
<p>The European startup market is now sufficiently robust and varied that it’s easy to lose track of its unicorns.</p>

<p>The Exchange has been tracking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/why-techstars-is-doubling-down-on-europe/">Europe’s startup acceleration</a> for years now. So, consider our general delight when <a href="https://atomico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomico</a>, a European venture fund, and <a href="https://dealroom.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dealroom</a>, a data-tracker with a solid European data set, <a href="https://stateofeuropeantech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped a huge sheaf of numbers</a> concerning its performance earlier this week.</p>

So, instead of snagging just high-level numbers that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/european-tech-booms-but-southern-europe-and-founder-diversity-still-lagging/">paint a more general picture</a>, we’re teasing out a few things that you might have missed in your own read. If you care about the state and the health of the European startup market, this is for you.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll take a look at exit volumes and what we can infer for 2022, how talent issues aren’t landing equally around the continent, why there’s good <em>and</em> bad news for gender diversity in Europe, how pension fund money is still on the sidelines, and which collections of former employees are founding the most companies.</p>
<p>Sounds good? Let’s rock.</p>
<h2>Good news for 2022 European exits</h2>
<p>European technology M&amp;A is having a good year. The Atomico/Dealroom report details that the total value of tech M&amp;A in Europe through the third quarter of 2021 has crossed the $100 billion mark. For reference, that figure was below $10 billion in Q2 2019, Q3 2019, Q4 2019 and Q2 2020.</p>
<p>But not every tech exit fits into the venture capital model. Venture-backed exits for European tech companies are a smaller figure, but one that is still rising. Per the same data set, in the first three quarters of 2021, VC-backed tech M&amp;A worked out to $54.9 billion. That’s a hair more than the full-year 2020 number of $54.8 billion. Throw in Q4’s numbers, and not only will 2021 be a record year for VC tech exits – this data doesn’t include IPOs, mind – it will be one by a comfortable margin.</p>
<p>But all that’s the past. We care more about the future. And that’s where the data set pushed our eyebrows higher. Atomico wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the third quarter alone, the aggregated value of tech M&amp;A activity exceeded $45B, making it the largest Q3 on record. At time of publication, preliminary numbers for Q4 imply at least another $50B in aggregate value.</p></blockquote>
<p>If those numbers hold up, we could see roughly 50% of the 2020 total European M&amp;A in Q4 2021 <em>alone</em>. That, and incremental gains from quarter to quarter, implies that Europe is starting 2022 on its strongest non-IPO exit footing in history. Bullish!</p>
<h2>The UK’s talent issues are notable, worsening</h2>
<p>Remember Brexit? If you don’t live in the U.K., the political and economic decoupling of the island from the continent may have receded into the back of your mind. It’s an SEP to some degree: <em>someone else’s problem</em>. But while we may think about it a bit less, U.K.-based startups have not forgotten.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wisdom-audio-community/id1576484544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisdom</a>, a social audio app that&#8217;s focused on surfacing &#8220;life advice&#8221; and broadening access to mentorship &#8212; and whose iOS app launch we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/wisdom-is-a-social-audio-app-for-opening-access-to-mentorship/">back in October</a> &#8212; has nabbed $2 million in seed funding off the back of early traction.</p>
<p>The seed is led by First Round Capital, with participation from a number of business angels.</p>
<p>The U.K.-based startup is not disclosing how many users its twist on social audio has attracted so far &#8212; but says mentors on its platform have shared some 600,000 minutes of &#8220;insights and guidance&#8221; to date; while this audio has generated 2.3 million minutes of listening (or, well, playback) in the eight weeks since the app&#8217;s official launch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246037" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Its approach to social audio combines a one-to-one &#8220;conversational&#8221; structure, centered on advice and mentorship, with the reach of a broadcast platform. (For more details on the platform see our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/wisdom-is-a-social-audio-app-for-opening-access-to-mentorship/">coverage of its launch</a>.)</p>
<p>Per Wisdom, the platform&#8217;s approach is proving popular with podcasters.</p>
<p>Other popular topics at this early stage include mindfulness and social media.</p>
<p>While &#8212; on the influencer/mentor side &#8212; it names the likes of musician Kenny G, Buffy the Vampire Slayer actor “Spike” James Marsters and baseball Hall of Famer Andre Dawson as among its early contributors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Commenting on the seed raise in a statement, First Round Capital said: “We believe social audio is in its infancy, and it has been great to join Dayo [Akinrinade, Wisdom&#8217;s founder and CEO] and witness firsthand her vision for Wisdom. Wisdom taps into some important trends, from social audio to algorithm-friendly design &#8212; all while reflecting just how powerful and impactful communities that feature a range of voices can be &#8212; helping to give diverse and overlooked people access to high quality mentorship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, only the &#8216;cocktail-party format&#8217; of Clubhouse has gained widespread traction, but we think ultimately that format will be one of a number of interesting social audio formats,&#8221; the VC firm added. &#8220;Wisdom’s format with intimate 1:1 conversations broadcast to many listeners and its timer to keep the conversation moving make it stand out within the social audio category. It’s great to be able to announce our investment in Social Audio Inc. and its Wisdom app, and we’re looking forward to seeing just how far this app with its unique format and its laudable mission will go.”</p>
<p>Akinrinade attributed &#8220;early success&#8221; to &#8220;our incredible, helpful community of mentors&#8221;, adding in a statement: &#8220;The funding and expertise of our new investors will enable us to nurture and grow this extraordinary community.”</p>
<p>The startup said the seed funding will be used to build out a roadmap of features &#8212; including features focused on boosting community engagement.</p>
<p>It also has an Android app in the works (slated for early 2022) and said its to-do list includes launching direct messages; enhancing its AI algorithms doing search and discovery; and building monetization for mentors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce in Africa is growing fast and its potential remains enormous as more people get connected to the internet. Across sub-Saharan Africa 303 million people, about 28% of the population, are connected to the mobile internet, according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy</span><a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and this number is expected to rise to 40% in three years’ time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As the number of those connected to the internet grows, and shoppers increasingly opt to buy goods online, e-commerce platforms are set to experience a spike in the number of orders made and the value of goods bought &#8212; as happened recently with <a href="https://www.jumia.co.ke/sp-about_new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumia.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SEC)</span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001558370-21-016571/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made by the pan-African e-commerce platform on Tuesday shows that the value of goods sold on its platform over the Black Friday season grew by 30 percentage points this year to reach $150 million. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246005" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Friday sales on Jumia started in 2012 and run from the first Friday of November to the end of the month. Orders made during that period rose by 39 percentage points to reach 4.3 million as the number of Jumia merchants also increased by 11 percentage points to 46,000. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/jumia-posts-revenue-and-order-gains-but-compounding-losses-drag-its-stock-lower/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also recorded 40 million unique visitors, a 27 percentage points increase over that period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported recently, the most</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/consumables-dominate-jumias-sales-as-buyer-habits-change/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">popular products on the site were consumables</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> followed by beauty and fashion items. This comes after the e-commerce platform launched more dark stores to expand its grocery category &#8212; which as per the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/jumia-posts-revenue-and-order-gains-but-compounding-losses-drag-its-stock-lower/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Q3 results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seem to be paying off, yet profitability for the NYSE-listed firm remains elusive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our consumers are increasingly turning to Jumia for their everyday needs with the top three fastest growing physical goods categories in volume terms being fast moving consumer goods (&#8216;FMCG&#8217;), followed by beauty and fashion,” said Jumia on the SEC filing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a past interview with TechCrunch, Jumia attributed the shift in shopping habits to the stay-at-home restrictions that fueled the need for online shopping as well as the youthful population that is quick to adopt new trends and the increasing smartphone and internet penetration across the continent. Smartphones contribute the most (75%) traffic to the e-commerce site, meaning that as more people get connected, online shoppers are set to increase. Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya account for most of the online sales on Jumia.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Packages handled by Jumia Logistics, its delivery business over the Black Friday season, reached 5.3 million, which Jumia said was “more than double the average monthly package volume in the first 10 months of 2021.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia is currently the biggest e-commerce platform in Africa, leading hundreds of others, including Nigeria’s Marketplace Africa and South Africa’s Souq, and bidorbuy. The e-commerce platform is available in 11 markets across Africa, including Algeria, Senegal, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uganda and Morocco. </span></p>

							<span class="byline__author-name">Mark Sullivan</span>
						<span class="byline__author-title" style="display: block;">Contributor</span>
		</div>

			</div>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		Mark Sullivan was a federal law enforcement agent for nearly 35 years and the director of the U.S. Secret Service from 2006 to 2013.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cybercriminals are getting more and more adept at exploiting the latest trend or issue of high public interest to spread malware and steal personal data from unsuspecting users.</p>
<p>Whether it’s an app related to your favorite TV show, government health updates about COVID or tracking missed package deliveries, the result is too often the same: infected devices leading to fraud or outright theft.</p>
<p>Basic cybersecurity hygiene is the key to protecting your devices against the most common types of malware, but we also need security built into technology to prevent these sophisticated cyberattacks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245654" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Secret Service is certainly best known for protecting the president. But its other primary mission is to safeguard the nation’s financial infrastructure and payment systems to preserve the integrity of the economy from a wide range of financial and electronic crimes, including U.S. counterfeit currency, bank and financial institution fraud, illicit financing operations, identity theft, access device fraud and cybercrimes.</p>
<p>With the prevalence of mobile devices in today’s world, that means that, as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recommends, “users should avoid — and enterprises should prohibit on their devices — sideloading of apps and the use of unauthorized app stores.”</p>
<p>The pandemic has been a boon to cybercriminals, taking “advantage of an opportunity to profit from our dependence on technology to go on an<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> internet crime spree</a>,” said Paul Abbate, deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center registered<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-the-internet-crime-complaint-center-2020-internet-crime-report-including-covid-19-scam-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 791,790 complaints in 2020</a>, nearly double the previous year’s total and the largest year-over-year increase ever recorded. One particularly insidious example was text messages that encouraged users to download an app to make vaccine appointments but then sent malware to every device in that user&#8217;s contacts that could steal personal data or banking information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) alerted the public to a new form of malware that induced a user to click on a link to track a supposedly missed package delivery, a common occurrence during the pandemic. The link downloaded a malware app, called FluBot, which could then compromise a user’s bank and other financial account details. Cybersecurity researchers discovered “the volume of malicious [FluBot] SMS messages can number in the<a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/flubot-android-malware-spreading-rapidly-through-europe-may-hit-us-soon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tens of thousands per hour</a>.” Hackers are even capitalizing on the popularity of the hit television show “Squid Game” with a<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/beware-the-squid-game-app-installing-malware-onto-peoples-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> new wave of cybercrimes</a> targeting mobile devices using malware hidden in apps related to the show.</p>
<p>Mobile devices are now the primary access point for the internet, with <a href="https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">61% of all website visits</a> in the United States in 2020 coming on mobile devices, cementing the trend that only became the majority in 2019. This is reflected in the increased targeting of mobile devices with cyberattacks, with complaints of phishing and smishing attacks &#8212; emails or SMS text messages with malicious links &#8212; to the FBI<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> more than doubling in 2020</a>, rising from 114,702 in 2019 to 241,342 last year.</p>
<p>As we enter the holiday shopping season, during which one survey indicates that <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/ecommerce/2021/11/mobile-commerce-holiday-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 55% of shoppers</a> will make at least one purchase with a mobile device, it is essential that device owners take precautions to protect themselves from attacks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/avoiding-banking-malware">NCSC recommends</a> that users follow basic protections, like frequently backing up their devices, using virus detection software and only installing “new apps onto your device from the app store your manufacturer recommends.” That guidance mirrors that from the DHS, which also included recommendations that operating systems, apps and other software should be updated regularly and that users and enterprises adopt multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>Simple cyber hygiene recommendations form a layered defense against attacks, dramatically reducing the threat of unauthorized access to mobile devices. Yet as critical and effective as these user actions are, cybercriminals utilize sophisticated techniques that exploit human psychology and behaviors to deceive users and penetrate devices.</p>
<p>These kinds of attacks, called social engineering attacks, utilize human interactions and social skills to trick users into allowing attackers access to their devices or systems, sometimes even getting users to disable optional security protections. Attacks like FluBot, fake vaccination sites and malicious “Squid Game” apps are all examples of social engineering.</p>
<p>According to DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, mobile device owners may be more vulnerable to social engineering attacks through text messages because mobile devices’ “integration of email, voice, text messages and web browser functionality<a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> increases the likelihood</a> that users will fall victim to engineered malicious activity.”</p>
<p>The White House’s Cybersecurity Summit earlier this year identified ways beyond cyber hygiene to protect against unauthorized access: “We need to transition to where technology is built securely by default. … We need to know we’re buying secure tech,” a senior White House official <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/08/25/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-the-presidents-upcoming-cybersecurity-meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>Secure-by-design mobile devices would build cyber hygiene protections into the device, removing human psychology from the security equation. Just as seat belts and air bags started as options for car buyers, they are now mandatory safety equipment in all cars.</p>
<p>Basic cyber hygiene protections like multifactor authentication or prohibitions on downloading apps from outside official app stores can be built into systems by design. Mobile devices with these kinds of protections baked in from the start would not be nearly as vulnerable to social engineering attacks even if the device owner was, like most people, interested in a hit television show or worried about a pandemic.</p>
<p>The public should follow the basic cyber hygiene recommendations of our cybersecurity agencies. But we also need to short-circuit sophisticated social engineering attacks and build high-security protections into the design of our technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spain&#8217;s government has agreed on the details of a draft startup law &#8212; passing the baton to the parliament to debate and potentially amend the plan ahead of a vote to turn it into actual law.</p>
<p>The Council of Ministers <a href="https://portal.mineco.gob.es/en-us/comunicacion/Pages/211210_agenda.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> adoption of the draft text today which it said contains important measures to cut red tape and remove bureaucratic obstacles for founding and investing in startups in Spain.</p>
<p>The package also targets reforms at stock options and access to visas in a bid to make the country a more attractive place for entrepreneurs and digital talent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245970" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://portal.mineco.gob.es/en-us/comunicacion/Pages/211210_agenda.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>, Spain&#8217;s government said the package of incentives includes what it touted as &#8220;the EU’s most beneficial treatment of returns on stock options&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ministers have agreed to raise the tax exemption on stock option income from €12,000 to €50,000 per year.</p>
<p>The draft also stipulates that taxation is delayed until the date of settlement &#8212; either when the stocks are sold or if the company goes public.</p>
<p>Other notable tax measures include a reduction in Corporate Tax and Non-Resident Income Tax (which drops from 25% to 15%) for four years &#8212; which aims to tackle a major barrier, given startups typically aren&#8217;t focused on booking revenue in their early years (yet, under the current rules, are expected to pay the same rate of tax as more established businesses).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The maximum deductible amount for investments in new or recently created companies is also raised (from €60,000 to €100,000 per year), while the deduction rate goes from 30% to 50% and the period for considering a company &#8220;recently created&#8221; is extended, per the draft adopted by ministers.</p>
<p>The reform also looks set to tackle another key complaint of local founders: The cost and bureaucracy of setting up a startup in Spain &#8212; which has led some founders to establish their business elsewhere in Europe even if they subsequently build their product out of offices in the country.</p>
<p>Under the draft law, ministers say the procedures for setting up a company will be &#8220;streamlined&#8221; into a single step and can be completed online without needing to pay a notary or registry expenses.</p>
<p>Startups will also be able to use an online portal to make business declarations and access benefits, per the release.</p>
<p>Olivier Plante, co-founder of a local keyboard startup, ThingThing &#8212; which develops <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/fleksy-raises-series-a-to-expand-its-keyboard-sdk-biz-after-10x-growth/">Fleksy</a> (a keyboard SDK business) out of offices in Spain &#8212; said he felt forced to incorporate his startup in the U.K. back in 2015 &#8212; because of relative costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were like three years not making a dime,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;First months we needed a lot of money to get started, registry, stocks, banks, notary (they are parasites tbh)&#8230;etc. That&#8217;s why we founded the company in the U.K. &#8212; it costs us 70 GBP instead of ~5K EUR in Spain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plante welcomed the reform package &#8212; saying that for him the two most important components are simplifying set-up for startups and the reduction in corporate tax rates in the early years.</p>
<p>The current approach is essentially &#8220;killing entrepreneurial spirit from day 1&#8221;, per Plante, or else limiting the pool of possible founders to those who are in a position to save enough money to get going. &#8220;Often, the real entrepreneurs have less means,&#8221; he noted, adding: &#8220;And Spain doesn&#8217;t enable the poor to become rich at the source.&#8221;</p>
<p>A local startup association, <a href="https://asociacionstartups.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">startups asociación españa</a>, also welcomed the adoption of the draft text by the Council of Ministers &#8212; although it said it&#8217;s still waiting to see all the details of the full text once that&#8217;s published.</p>
<p>It also said it&#8217;s hoping the parliament will go even further in improving the proposal &#8212; suggesting it should further increase the number of years for a business to be deemed a startup; and &#8212; potentially (assuming the draft has not done so) &#8212; make changes to limiting requirements (such as a startup needing to have 60% of staff in Spain to qualify; or revenue of (only) up to €5 million).</p>
<p>The association was most fulsome in its praise of the planned boost to tax deduction for startup investors &#8212; dubbing that &#8220;excellent news that puts us on an equal footing with others successful ecosystems&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reform package contains a number of other measures to incentivize entrepreneurialism &#8212; such as entrepreneurs who are simultaneously working as employees at another job no longer being required to contribute twice to the Social Security system (which disincentives bootstrapping); and plans for establishing sandboxes or trial licences in regulated sectors to foster the development of novel services and MVPs.</p>
<p>Although it remains to be seen how the parliament may amend specific details.</p>
<p>In terms of time frame, a government source told TechCrunch it believes the law will be approved in the first half of 2022 &#8212; however, they noted that the deadline allows until the end of the year.</p>
<p>On the funding front, Spain&#8217;s government has an investment target of up to €4 billion to direct toward fostering startup growth &#8212; including drawing on European Union coronavirus recovery funding.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed a lawsuit against spyware maker DarkMatter, along with three former members of U.S. intelligence or military agencies, for allegedly hacking the iPhone of a prominent Saudi human rights activist.  The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Loujain al-Hathloul, who claims she was among the victims of an illegal hacking [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/saudi-human-rights-activist-represented-eff-sues-spyware-maker-darkmatter-violating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> against spyware maker DarkMatter, along with three former members of U.S. intelligence or military agencies, for allegedly hacking the iPhone of a prominent Saudi human rights activist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Loujain al-Hathloul, who claims she was among the victims of an illegal hacking campaign orchestrated by DarkMatter and three former U.S. intelligence officers hired by the UAE following the Arab Spring protests.</p>
<p>The former NSA operatives — named in the lawsuit as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/expressvpn/">ExpressVPN</a> CIO Daniel Gerike, Marc Baier and Ryan Adams — were part of the Project Raven hacking program, an effort by the UAE to spy on human rights activists, politicians, journalists and dissidents opposed to the government during the Arab Spring protests.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245948" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Back in September, the three former spies agreed to pay a cumulative $1.7 million after admitting to violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and prohibitions on selling sensitive military technology under a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department. </span>They are also permanently banned from any jobs involving computer network exploitation, working for certain UAE organizations, exporting defense articles or providing defense services.</p>
<p>Al-Hathloul — best known for her efforts in calling for greater women&#8217;s rights in Saudi Arabia — claims the ex-spies exploited a vulnerability in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/imessage/">iMessage</a> to illegally hack into her iPhone in order to secretly monitor her communications and location. This, she claims, led to her “arbitrary arrest by the UAE’s security services and rendition to Saudi Arabia, where she was detained, imprisoned and tortured.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/alhathloul-v-darkmatter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> alleges Gerike, Baier and Adams purchased malicious code from a U.S. company and intentionally directed the code to Apple servers in the U.S. to reach and place malicious software on al-Hathloul’s iPhone in violation the CFAA. It also alleges that they aided and abetted in crimes against humanity due to the fact the hacking of al-Hathloul’s phone was part of the UAE’s widespread and systematic attack against human rights defenders and activists.</p>
<p>The EFF, which filed the lawsuit alongside law firms Foley Hoag LLP and Boise Matthews LLP, says this is a “clear-cut” case of device hacking, whereby “DarkMatter operatives broke into al-Hathloul’s iPhone without her knowledge to insert malware, with horrific consequences.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Project Raven went beyond even the behaviour that we have seen from <a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/security/spyware/361529/nso-group-ceo-quits-us-sanctions-pegasus-spyware" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSO Group</a>, which has been caught repeatedly having sold software to authoritarian governments who use their tools to spy on journalists, activists and dissidents,&#8221; said Eva Galperin, cybersecurity director at EFF. &#8220;DarkMatter didn&#8217;t merely provide the tools; they oversaw the surveillance program themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, al-Hathloul said:</p>
<blockquote><p>No government or individual should tolerate the misuse of spy malware to deter human rights or endanger the voice of the human conscious. This is why I have chosen to stand up for our collective right to remain safe online and limit government-backed cyber abuses of power.</p>
<p>I continue to realize my privilege to possibly act upon my beliefs. I hope this case inspires others to confront all sorts of cybercrimes while creating a safer space for all of us to grow, share and learn from one another without the threat of power abuses.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks like Better.com CEO Vishal Garg’s behavior is catching up to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This morning, employees were notified via email by the Better board of directors that Garg would be taking time off effective immediately after the “very regrettable events over the last week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move came, according to an employee who wished not to be named, after the digital mortgage company hired a crisis firm earlier this week. For those of us following the drama over the past week &#8212; over the past year, really &#8212; it was not a surprise.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245988" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More details around the executive’s behavior have emerged, including in emails that surfaced this week in which Garg <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkpgkm/bettercom-ceo-called-top-investor-sewage-said-making-company-money-would-earn-employees-freedom?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=vice_facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR29-4py26TZPqQoPhq59VxO2wnYtsCvr584dnzNjdN04ndklDgq0j0Tmzs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">berated his own investors, </a>Vice reported. He already had a reputation for using abusive language in emails to employees, but the treatment toward his investors was yet another shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the email to employees sent this morning, the board said that during the interim period, CFO Kevin Ryan would be assuming the responsibilities of CEO. It also acknowledged that it had engaged “an independent 3rd party firm to do a leadership and cultural assessment,” the results of which would be “taken into account to build a long-term sustainable and positive culture at Better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the decision may be too little, too late. TechCrunch has spoken with multiple current and former employees who remain skeptical that a toxic culture can be reversed that quickly. Those same employees shared that the CEO&#8217;s so-called &#8220;apology&#8221; &#8212; which came after the resignations of the company&#8217;s heads of PR, marketing and communications &#8212; was widely viewed as insincere damage control.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Better.com CEO Vishal Garg apologizes to current employees for &#8216;blundering&#8217; of mass layoffs; SPAC delayed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-apologizes-to-current-employees-for-blundering-the-execution-of-mass-layoffs/embed/#?secret=ZXb8uaoRUr" data-secret="ZXb8uaoRUr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One employee said she had been thinking of resigning even before the recent events, but they finally pushed her over the edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garg &#8220;leads by fear,” she said, preferring not to be named. “Nothing is ever good enough. He would threaten employees to work harder, faster and not be lazy, but there was never clarity on what the consequences might be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pressure seemingly intensified over the past few months as the company took a hit when the number of refinancings declined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It wasn’t a shock that the market had turned on us,” the employee said. “But the model’s predictions were that it wouldn’t happen this quickly. There just seemed to be more underlying anxiety after the SoftBank investment over the summer and with the SPAC approaching. But they could have been more transparent and just admit they overhired people last year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company laid off 9% of its staff last week, one day after receiving a $750 million cash infusion as part of an amended SPAC agreement. While it was not the first (or likely the last) company to lay off workers via Zoom in this pandemic era, the way it was handled seemed to offend even casual observers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another sign of panic was that the company, after declaring itself remote-first, was suddenly asking people to return in-person. This was confusing to many, including those who had already moved and bought houses in other cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mid-November, </span><a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/better-com-forecasts-another-rough-quarter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HousingWire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported on preliminary results published by Better’s SPAC partner, Aurora Acquisition Corp., revealing that the digital lender expected a net loss between $85 million and $100 million in the third quarter. And the forecast looked even worse for the fourth quarter, according to an </span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-326251/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S-4 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</span></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to HousingWire: “The filing noted that the fluctuations in interest rates – which affect refis more than purchase business – and a recent reorganization of Better’s sales and operations teams has put pressure on the company’s net income and will continue to do so for the foreseeable next quarter, as the company attempts to find footing in a purchase market.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is after a year in which Garg received a $25 million cash bonus: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2020, after previously requesting an equity-based award, our CEO was paid a one-time discretionary bonus of $25.0 million as determined by the Board based on his 2020 performance,&#8221; the S4 filing said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, one former employee said her colleagues that stayed on were being asked to take pay cuts and not receiving bonuses. She added that during the pandemic, despite being remote, customer-facing employees were forced to clock in breaks at exactly 15 minutes and 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we went over by even one minute, we&#8217;d be talked down to by managers,” she told TechCrunch. “Some team members even had talkings-to by senior managers on this matter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same employee also scoffed at the notion that Better lived up to its image of being a fintech where opportunities to grow were plentiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Better advertised itself as a powerful fintech startup where all who wanted to grow within the ecosystem, could. This was untrue,” she said. “There were virtually no opportunities for growth, raise, department collaboration, etc. Managers were sales machines and regardless of career paths, there was no room to succeed. … At Better, we were essentially taught to push customers/callers for rate locks, regardless of their intention.”</span></p>
<p>Better did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nuvocargo.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvocargo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a logistics startup out to help simplify the challenges of cross-border trade,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $20.5 million in a round led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round valued the New York-based startup at $180 million, more than double the $70 million it was valued at when it raised $12 million in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it still had most of that cash in the bank when Tiger approached it.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245821" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We didn’t need the capital, but Tiger showed real conviction and moved fast with their term sheet,” said Nuvocargo co- founder and CEO Deepak Chhugani.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup claims to pair its technology with a “team of experts” to integrate end-to-end movement of cargo in “a single platform.” Specifically, it offers an all-in-one service that rolls freight forwarding, customs brokerage, cargo insurance and even trade financing into one UI-friendly software and app. The company claims it gives </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">its customers more visibility and better data to understand their supply chain.</span></p>
<div class="section-header-wrapper ng-star-inserted">
<div class="section-title-wrapper"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Let’s dig a bit deeper into this. Importers and exporters that need to move products between the United States and Mexico typically have to work with a number of different vendors to help with different pieces of that process.</span></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A truckload from Mexico to the U.S. will have to hire a trucking company in Mexico. To find that company, you might have to go through a broker. Then when the truck gets to the border, you have to deal with all this paperwork to actually get an export out of Mexico imported into the U.S.,” Chhugani explained. “You also have to then hire another company to help you move the trailer from Mexico to the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s called a transfer carrier for the unacquainted. Then on top of that, the vendor has to go through the same process in the U.S. to find a trucking company to get the product to its final destination.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midsize companies either have to form logistics departments in-house to deal with all the complexities, different currencies, laws and vendors, or, they hire brokers and freight forwarders to help with pieces of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With our flagship offering, we go to companies and say, ‘we can take care of that entire experience for you,’” Chhugani said. “We have the infrastructure, the transportation network, the compliance and the software to help you move those products end to end. It’s kind of a one-stop shop. In that way, we become an extension of our customers.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2245832" style="width: 1609px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2245832" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2245832 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nuvotruck.jpg" alt="" width="1599" height="1200" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nuvotruck.jpg 1599w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nuvotruck.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nuvotruck.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nuvotruck.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nuvotruck.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nuvotruck.jpg?resize=1536,1153 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Nuvotruck.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1599px) 100vw, 1599px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2245832" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuvocargo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Nuvocargo mainly focuses on the transportation aspect of moving the goods. Down the line, it’s rolling out a series of other products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has revealed the first of a series of financial products it is building &#8212; QuickPay for carriers, which is essentially a cash advance product for the truckers in Nuvocargo’s marketplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been in a small private beta for a couple of months and the adoption has been extremely exciting,” Chhugani said. “QuickPay for carriers has been growing processing volumes by 35% weekly and recently crossed seven figures in annualized transaction volume in just a few short weeks since launch.”</span></p>
<p>With an estimated 10 million trucks moving <span class="il">cargo</span> between Mexico and the United States each year, <span class="il">Nuvocargo</span> estimates the market for QuickPay at around $20 billion annually.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain issues have dominated headlines for some time now, and what Nuvocargo is building has great potential to improve efficiencies along the trade corridor between the U.S. and Latin America, according to Tiger’s John Curtius.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it began operations in late 2019, Nuvocargo has been growing its revenues by about 30% month over month. While he declined to reveal hard revenue figures, Chhugani expects Nuvocargo will generate “tens of millions of dollars” in annual revenue in 2022. It’s also on track to close this year with 5x revenue growth compared to 2020. The company has tripled its team since announcing its Series A in April, from 30 to about 90.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also participating in the latest round of funding is The Flexport Fund, Kavak COO Federico Ranero and existing backers such as QED Investors, NFX and ALLVP. Prior Nuvocargo investors include Y Combinator, Nubank founder David Velez and the co-founders of several unicorns, including Deel, Rappi, Ramp and Loft, among others. The additional funding brings Nuvocargo’s total raised to date to $37.8 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The U.S.-Mexico cross-border trade is poised for growth in the coming years with Mexico&#8217;s growing manufacturing sector,” said Hursh Narain, partner at The Flexport Fund. &#8220;Deepak is an incredible founder that understands the current state and has vision for a digital future state.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvocargo fits the fund&#8217;s thesis that customers in global logistics are better served hiring digitally native service providers than they are trying to layer software on top of the old, offline world, added Ben Braverman, chief customer officer at Flexport and partner at The Flexport Fund.</span></p>

<p>We got into the Lyft mafia, garbage and why our local truckers are giving us creator economy vibes. Or more specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/kenyas-pariti-raises-2-85m-led-by-harlem-capital-to-develop-startup-ecosystems-in-emerging-markets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya’s Pariti raised $2.85 million led by Harlem Capital to develop startup ecosystems in emerging markets</span></a>, proving yet again how Africa&#8217;s entrepreneurial scene is one not to miss. The empowerment trend continued with TrueNorth&#8217;s <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/truenorth-has-raised-50-million-from-sam-altman-and-others-to-empower-independent-truckers/">$50 million fundraise to help biz-savvy independent truckers,</a> and freshly anointed unicorn AgentSync with news, as Alex reminds us, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/agentsync-raises-75m-for-its-insurance-focused-api-business/">that insurtech is very much alive. </a></li>
<li>OpenSea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/long-time-lyft-cfo-departs-to-become-cfo-at-nft-marketplace-opensea/">got a new CFO from Lyft</a>, which led to IPO rumors, denial and rumors about why there&#8217;s denial about going public. Plus, as Natasha notes, if you&#8217;re not leaving Lyft to join crypto, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/climactic-raj-kapoor-josh-felser/">you&#8217;re leaving Lyft to join climate. </a></li>
<li>The Trump Media SPAC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/the-sec-is-curious-about-trumps-spac-deal/">is a mess</a>, as we anticipated, frankly.</li>
<li>Mary Ann is all over the Better.com saga as its comm, marketing and PR heads all <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-coms-pr-comms-marketing-heads-submit-resignations-in-wake-of-layoffs-fiasco/">submitted their resignations</a> this week and CEO Vishal Garg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-apologizes-to-current-employees-for-blundering-the-execution-of-mass-layoffs/">issued a poorly received apology</a> for how badly he effed up the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">mass layoffs</a> <em>last</em> week &#8212; and as she hints, there&#8217;s a lot more to come.</li>
</ul>
<p>We disagreed more than usual this episode, which is refreshing. So cheers to more of that next year, and we&#8217;ll see you back here on Monday.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We need to grok how 2021 ended to understand where 2022 begins.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The 2021 IPO cycle is winding down this week as HashiCorp and Nubank priced their public debuts and listed. Happily for startup fans and the venture classes, both IPOs went well. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/iot-data-collector-samsaras-ipo-will-be-fun-to-watch/">Samsara&#8217;s IPO will come next week</a> if current calendars hold up, but that&#8217;s pretty much it for the year.</p>
<p>We made it to the end! But that doesn&#8217;t mean that we don&#8217;t have work to do. We do.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re parsing the final IPO prices of both HashiCorp and Nubank, tabulating their final pre-debut valuations and revenue multiples, and teasing out what we can learn from their early trading. The goal is to get a good handle on how strong the U.S. technology IPO market looks as 2021 ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>There should be, provided no major shocks, an active 2022 IPO cycle. Our basis for that perspective is that technology valuations for public companies remain far above historical norms and the backlog of yet-private unicorns is at an all-time high. The combination reads like a recipe for a lot of flotations next year.</p>
<p>But we need to grok how 2021 ended to understand where 2022 begins.</p>
<h2>HashiCorp&#8217;s IPO</h2>
<p>HashiCorp anticipated that it would price its IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/hashicorps-ipo-will-place-it-among-the-most-richly-valued-open-source-tech-companies/">between $68 and $72 per share</a>. It wound up selling equity in its public debut <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/09/2348726/0/en/HashiCorp-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering.html">at $80 per share</a>, a massive win for the open source-focused software company.</p>
<p>Renaissance Capital <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/89098/Cloud-infrastructure-platform-HashiCorp-sets-terms-for-$1.1-billion-IPO">noted</a> that at $70 per share, HashiCorp was worth $14.2 billion. Simple math pegs the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation with an $80 per-share price at $16.2 billion. Given that the company was last valued at around the $5 billion mark by private-market investors in early 2020, its IPO price was nothing short of revolutionary, though we might argue that it was simply underpriced in 2020, undercutting how staggering its IPO price really was.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Now with the new capital in hand, CEO Katie Spies plans to “put a foot on the gas” to push its 20% month over month growth to 25%.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As consumers think more about what they are putting in their bodies, they are also thinking about what they are feeding their pets. Driven by the global pandemic and everyone being at home with their pets, sales <a href="https://www.bioguardlabs.com/pandemic-era-pet-industry-surpasses-record-breaking-100-billion-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topped $100 billion in 2020</a> in this sector.</p>
<p>Austin-based <a href="http://www.meetmaev.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maev</a>, developing human-grade raw dog food, is poised to take a share of the raw food category, announcing today it raised $9 million in a round of funding led by Springdale Ventures. The company previously raised undisclosed rounds backed by VMG Partners, Bolt and Willow Growth.</p>
<p>The idea for the direct-to-consumer pet care brand was sparked in 2018 by CEO Katie Spies and Christine Busaba. Prior to starting the company, Spies started her career as an engineer, stacking up three degrees. She worked at a startup as a product development manager, but ultimately left that behind to find a different calling. It was during that time that she became a dog walker and realized what was needed in the dog food space.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Though they officially started the company in 2019, Busaba and Spies didn’t launch their first product, the raw dog food, until 2020. The pandemic initially affected Maev’s ability to get started. The company had four employees and had to shift its launch plans and even push back its funding round, she said. It ended up working out, and today, it has added supplemental vitamin bars and bone broth topper to its product pipeline.</p>
<p>The food products were created alongside a team of veterinary nutritionists and clinically tested to address nutritional gaps for a healthier dog. The frozen food is made with real meats, vegetables and fruits and unlike competitor brands that have to be thawed, Maev’s products are ready-to-eat out of the freezer, Spies said.</p>
<p>“We started with three products, but we are building the future of pet care,” she added. “This grocery aisle had little innovation. There are some great products, but pet parents have accepted that healthier products mean being harder to use. We aim to make products easier and great for your dog.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maev sells its food as a subscription product, with costs averaging about $2 per meal. Over the past year, the company acquired about 2,000 customers and has 16 employees and 11 open jobs. During that time, the company has been growing both its revenue and customer bases, investing in supply chain and solidifying its innovation.</p>
<p>Now with the new capital in hand, Spies plans to “put a foot on the gas” to push its 20% month over month growth to 25%. In the next year, the company will be selling its products in an omnichannel capacity with a focus on customer retention. It is already seeing 92% of customers stick around after their first box, a statistic Spies explained is not seen frequently in other pet food brands, where the industry average is 60%.</p>
<p>She expects to invest the new capital in its headquarters move to Austin, brand awareness and hiring across marketing and supply chain. One of the company’s biggest customer requests is a chicken product, and plans are in the works to have one available in three months. Spies expects that addition to outsell its current beef product.</p>
<p>With 95 million dogs in the U.S. Spies notes the company has plenty of room to grow. There are 112 fresh pet food companies with new entrants shaking up the market over the past few years, she said. Maev is one of the latest to attract venture-backed funding, joining <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/alpha-paw-brings-in-5-2m-to-carve-out-its-niche-in-the-pet-wellness-space/">Alpha Paw</a> and <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2021/11/jinx-raises-28m-in-series-a-funding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jinx</a> in announcing new raises in the past two months.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, pet food incumbents are also putting a paw print in the healthier food space: <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/freshpet-launches-fresh-vegetarian-dog-food-brand-spring--sprout-301368725.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freshpet launched its Spring &amp; Sprout vegetarian dog food</a> in September and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hills-pet-nutrition-partners-with-bond-pet-foods-inc-to-develop-a-craft-meat-protein-produced-through-precision-fermentation-301420943.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hill’s Pet Nutrition announced a partnership with Bond Pet Foods</a> last month to create meat proteins via fermentation for pet food applications.</p>
<p>“It’s been really interesting to watch the market evolve,” Spies said. “Today, it is great that more dog owners are educated on some of the problems with standard kibble and are skeptical about what they are feeding their dogs. However, when you boil down all of the decisions you make about your dog, this is the most important one for health and longevity.”</p>
<p>That attention to detail and care for pets is what attracted many of Maev’s investors to jump on board.</p>
<p>“We are highly particular and prescriptive in considering brands to bring into the VMG portfolio, making our investments sparse, yet strategic in those companies that have what it takes to become iconic brands,” said Carle Stenmark, partner at VMG Partners, in a written statement. “We were immediately drawn to Maev by its incredibly engaged and vocal customer base, as well as our alignment with Katie, who we believe is a world-class founder setting the standard for the next-generation of pet care.”</p>
<p>“Innovation in our space doesn’t just mean new products in different formats or packaging; instead, it’s looking at the consumer’s life and finding ways to exceed their expectations and enhance their daily routines, which includes their loved ones and furry friends,” added Dan Graham, co-founder and general partner of Springdale Ventures. “Outside of being a fantastic product at the leading edge of the better-for-you pet food movement, Katie’s passion and determination for changing the lives of pets and their owners is a journey on which we’re excited to be, especially as our first investment into the pet space, with more to come.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company launched its tool in March that help e-commerce stores and brands increase their revenue using pricing, products and trends data from other companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh from its time in Y Combinator, SaaS startup <a href="https://www.anakin.company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anakin</a> raised $2 million to continue developing its software enabling e-commerce companies to see live pricing data on their competitors.</p>
<p>Mohit Prateek and Rashmi Bala started the company last September and officially launched in March to help e-commerce stores and brands increase their revenue using pricing, products and trends data from other companies. While the company’s moniker is indeed the name of a “Star Wars” character, CEO Prateek said they chose it more for name recognition than a passion for the movies.</p>
<p>Prior to starting the company, the co-founders were already working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and e-commerce at companies like Flipkart and Truefit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245790" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Prateek, in particular, just happened to be trying to solve the pricing problem at Flipkart with a large team optimizing SKUs across geographies and channels. He later left to build other startups, but continued to get inquiries from e-commerce companies for help with pricing. It was when the amount of calls increased that he asked Bala, with whom he was already working, if she wanted to build a business.</p>
<p>“We had customers even before we started building the company,” Prateek told TechCrunch. “We didn’t have a product to sell them, though, it was just me advising them on how to set it up.”</p>
<p>Here’s how the technology works: Company A prices an item, for example a tomato, and everyone else has to price their tomatoes similarly to entice buyers to buy it from them instead of Company A.</p>
<p>Rather than try to guess what the best price will be, Anakin automates the management and pricing of millions of SKUs from competitors using data like inventory to provide those insights in real time so that retailers can increase their revenue, on average, by up to 12%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Anakin started in the grocery space and has now expanded into food delivery, ridesharing and travel. Though he was not able to disclose customers, Prateek did say the company is working with some of the largest companies in those spaces.</p>
<p>In fact, prior to securing the seed round, the company was already profitable. It didn’t need to raise the round, but Anakin was running lean with just the two of them and wanted to grow fast in multiple sectors and geographies, he added.</p>
<p>The company, with a presence in San Francisco, Singapore and India, secured the new capital from Y Combinator, HOF Capital, Austen Allred, ACE &amp; Company, Integrity, Pioneer Fund and a group of angel investors.</p>
<p>So far, Anakin is growing its revenue 24% every month and is live in more than 10 countries, Prateek said. The funding will be used to hire additional employees to have more boots on the ground in other countries. The company will also invest in product development, expanding into other categories and creating a self-service tool.</p>
<p>“We started in the middle of COVID, and we were scared that it would shut us down, but even mom-and-pop stores are online and competing with Amazon,” he added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Employing a dark store model is “virtually non-existent in Canada,” according to the company.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grocery delivery startup <a href="https://hello.gotiggy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiggy</a> is a new player in the Canadian quick commerce space, announcing Friday $6.35 million in seed funding to get its dark stores up-and-running to accommodate 15-minute deliveries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/7056/online-grocery-market-in-canada/#dossierKeyfigures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-commerce sales are a $29 billion market in Canada</a>, but food delivery is still nascent. Eugene Bisovka and Razmik Sukyasov co-founded Vancouver-based Tiggy in July 2021, just about the time that <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/instacart-begins-online-grocery-delivery-quebec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instacart announced it was beginning food delivery in Quebec</a>, giving the food delivery giant access to all 10 Canadian provinces now.</p>
<p>Many individual grocers offered their own delivery during the global pandemic, in addition to the delivery incumbents Instacart, PC Express, Inabuggy, DoorDash and Uber Eats. Tiggy is taking the approach of offering a faster delivery, with no minimum charge or no extra cost, which Bisovka told TechCrunch differentiates the company from its competitors that have longer delivery times and associated fees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245780" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“What impressed me was that Canada has a $100 billion market and almost no food delivery players,” he added. “That was a big reason we chose this market. You can get groceries from DoorDash or Uber Eats, but it takes one hour for delivery and they charge fees, so it is not clear what the final price will be.”</p>
<p>Employing a dark store model is another differentiator, as the model is one that is “virtually non-existent in Canada,” Bisovka said. He explained that the dark store approach leads to hundreds of additional orders per day in the $25 to $30 range, with a projected contribution margin between 10% and 12%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company launched its service in September with over 1,400 SKUs, including pantry staples and fresh fruits and vegetables. It is also encouraging more consumer behavior toward on-demand shopping, for example, if you’re cooking and run out of an item or realize you don’t have it.</p>
<p>Heartland led the seed round and was joined by Global Founders Capital, FJ Labs and Redbox Ventures. With the new capital, Bisovka intends to double the amount of SKUs offered, expand Tiggy’s footprint in Vancouver with two new dark stores — it already has four stores — and enter Toronto with five stores by the end of the year. It also gives the company a solid runway to open 350 fulfillment centers across the country by 2024.</p>
<p>Though Bisovka declined to discuss growth metrics outside of having now employed 150 people in five months, Turner Novak, founder of Banana Capital, and one of the company’s early investors, said Tiggy was growing “at an impressive pace” and is already disrupting incumbents that have 1 million customers.</p>
<p>“It’s been impressive watching them over the past couple of months,” Novak added. “With the dark store model, there is more of an opportunity to stay capital efficient, though harder to launch your own fulfillment. If you can do it, you will have more longevity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.earnr.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earnr</a> is a new finance and tax service aimed at the U.K. creator economy and people doing &#8220;side-hustle&#8221; businesses. It’s now secured £650,000 to launch an app aimed at &#8220;solopreneurs&#8221;. The round was led by <a href="https://7pc.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7percent Ventures</a>, and was joined by Antler and FJ Labs.</p>
<p>The startup deals with the financial and tax admin side of new ventures, and works with private, personal bank accounts. The app provides a hub of financial tools and services for these self-employed side-hustlers, as it provides digital bookkeeping and accountancy services, automates tax returns and comes with access to expert help.</p>
<p>Anyone earning less than £3,000 from their side hustle can submit their tax return for free, and over that Earnr charges a flat £99 fee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245951" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Enzo Ottens said: “Many of us in the Earnr team started our own side hustles during the U.K.’s many lockdowns, and although doing this is getting easier than ever, finance and tax admin is always where complexity and the risk of expensive mistakes lurk… So we’ve built a service that does it all for you, and automatically with a minimum of hands-on input.”</p>
<p>Andrew J. Scott, founding Partner at 7percent Ventures, said: &#8220;We backed Enzo and the Earnr team because of their ambition to disrupt the half-trillion-dollar accounting sector globally using AI At 7percent we love startups which aim to fundamentally transform laggard industries and Earnr were aligned on the fastest way to do that, starting today with tax returns for side earners.”</p>

Also participating was Ascension and D4 Ventures, among others.</p>
<p>HURR launched in 2019 and has a hybrid business model, combining peer-to-peer fashion rentals, direct partnerships with fashion outlets and a white-label service with retailers such as Selfridges Rental. It also has a physical store in Selfridges London, and a partnership with global resale platform Depop.</p>
<p>Commenting, Victoria Prew, CEO and founder of HURR, said: “As a millennial, I’m part of a generation that loves shared ownership. We’ve all witnessed the rise of disruptive tech-first businesses such as Airbnb and Uber and, if we can rent our houses and cars, why not our wardrobes.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245941" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Matt Chandler, consumer investor at Octopus Ventures, said: “HURR is perfectly placed to capitalize on the shift towards new models of ownership and spearhead the transition to a more climate-friendly fashion industry.”</p>

<p>A final decision on whether or not to grant the extradition will be made by the U.K. secretary of state.</p>
<p>The U.S. wants to put Assange on trial for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/arrested-wikileaks-founder-is-now-facing-u-s-extradition/">conspiracy to hack and computer misuse</a>. He also faces a number of charges under the controversial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/julian-assange-espionage-act/">Espionage Act</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245925" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In all he faces 18 counts connected with &#8220;obtaining and disclosing defence and national security material&#8221; through the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WikiLeaks website</a>, primarily in 2009 and 2010 but also &#8220;to some extent since&#8221;, per a court summary.</p>

<p>Defenders of the polarizing figure argue he&#8217;s being persecuted for telling truth to power and that his extradition would have a chilling effect on journalism &#8212; given the U.S. government is pursuing charges that include publishing classified information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Assange obtained the information from former U.S. Army solider and whistleblower Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, who disclosed hundreds of thousands of classified or sensitive military and diplomatic documents that Assange then published via WikiLeaks &#8212; causing huge embarrassment for the U.S. government.</p>
<p>The leaked material included army reports and videos of airstrikes, including instances of civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with hundreds of thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/usa-v-julian-assange-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summary of the judgement</a> issued today, the U.K. High Court said it has accepted a package of assurances from the U.S. government related to the previous district judge&#8217;s concerns that Assange is a suicide risk.</p>
<p>The Court said four assurances have been offered, adding that is &#8220;satisfied&#8221; the assurances exclude the possibility of Assange being subject to “special administrative measures” &#8212; or held at a maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado, USA (either pretrial or after any conviction) vis-à-vis the acts he is currently accused of committing.</p>
<p>The U.S. has also agreed to consent to an application by Assange to be transferred to Australia to serve his sentence if he is convicted; and agreed that while he is in custody in the U.S. he will receive &#8220;appropriate clinical and psychological treatment as recommended by a qualified treating clinician at the prison where he is held&#8221;, per the Court summary.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court rejected various criticisms of those assurances which were argued on Mr Assange’s behalf, and was satisfied that the assurances were sufficient to meet the concerns which led to the DJ’s decision,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>A final decision on whether to allow Assange&#8217;s extradition will pass to the U.K.&#8217;s home secretary, Priti Patel &#8212; failing a successful appeal of the High Court&#8217;s decision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that has built a decentralized exchange as well as a cross-chain infrastructure to facilitate communication across layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain solutions is the latest to receive backing from Coinbase Ventures.</p>
<p>Singapore-headquartered Router Protocol said on Friday it has raised $4.1 million in a strategic funding round from Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research, Polygon, Woodstock, Wami Capital, QCP, De-Fi Capital, Maple Block, TeraSurge Capital, Wintermute and Shima Capital, as well as several entrepreneurs. The startup also raised $485,000 in its seed round last year.</p>
<p>We have seen a proliferation of layer 1 blockchain networks that are all attempting to solve similar problems in recent years. As these layer 1 projects gain traction, they are able to attract the developer community that builds layer 2 solutions atop of their preferred blockchain.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244704" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Blockchains are like cities and you can scale them endlessly, but unless you build the connectivity infra, nobody goes there,” said Ramani Ramachandran, founder and chief executive of Router Protocol, in an interview with TechCrunch. “So we have had all these blockchains coming up, but no connectivity between them. So that was the genesis of Router Protocol,” he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.routerprotocol.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Router Protocol</a>, founded last year, is betting that many of these layer 1 blockchain networks will continue to operate and many more will join the fray. Its offering allows developers to seamlessly move liquidity across chains seamlessly. “There are probably about 50 blockchains, with 50 different communities and their own energy,” he said.</p>
<p>“There are going to be layer 1 scaling solutions &#8212; the Polygons of the world &#8212; and ‘Ethereum killers’ such as Aave, Solana and then we have non-EVM players such as Terra and Algorand that are coming up from different perspectives. You marry that with profusion of capital in the space. All of these players have a large warchest. Nobody is talking about less than a $1 billion warchest. The battle is not going to end anytime soon.”</p>
<p>Router Protocol’s other offering is Dfyn, which is a decentralized exchange, like Uniswap or Pancake Swap, that is built on top of Polygon. “It’s like we have a bunch of airport terminals called Dfyn, and then we have airline routes that connect these Dyfn networks. But they also connect other airports. That’s the beauty of the whole model.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ramachandran said he expects cross-chain solutions to become more popular next year. &#8220;Let&#8217;s imagine you&#8217;re on Solana blockchain and you want to sell Ethereum, but you see much better prices on Binance Smart Chain. Router will enable you to do get the best price on Binance Smart Chain with one click and bring it back to your native blockchain, which is Solana,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Trading is the most popular use case on Router Protocol today, but Ramachandran said he expects many more applications to make inroads in the future. &#8220;Once you speak across borders, you can not just trade, but borrow, lend and do cross-chain governance. Sushi, for instance, has 15 chains and 15 different communities. To get a community vote across these chains is a nightmare as you will be required to do 15 different snapshots. So that is something we can solve. You can borrow from one chain, and lend on another,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The firm plans to deploy the capital to scale its product offerings and also invest in multiple security audits, it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting blockchains to communicate effectively with each other is the holy grail for DeFi going forward, and we are happy to work with the team behind Router &amp; Dfyn and support their unique approach to solving this problem,&#8221; said Darius Sit, co-founder of QCP Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We anticipate future Web 3.0 activity across several multi-purpose and application-specific blockchains. Router&#8217;s XCLP will be an important cross-chain infrastructure solution enabling the flow of liquidity across chains. We are delighted to back and support the Router team in their efforts in this direction.&#8221;</p>
