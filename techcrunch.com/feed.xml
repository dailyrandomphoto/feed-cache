										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is at risk of disappearing, just as the social media network popular among conservatives was reaching new heights of popularity in the wake of President Donald Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">ban from all major tech social platforms</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon-web-services" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which provides backend cloud services, has informed Parler that it intends to cut ties with the company in the next 24 hours, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws">according to a report in BuzzFeed News.</a> Parler&#8217;s application is built on top of AWS infrastructure, services that are critical for the operation of its platform. Earlier today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">Apple announced that it was following Google in blocking the app from its App Store</a>, citing a lack of content moderation.</p>
<p>Parler, whose fortunes have soared as users upset at the President&#8217;s silencing on mainstream social media outlets flocked to the service, is now another site of contention in the struggle over the limits of free speech and accountability online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Parler CEO John Matze said that <a href="https://twitter.com/parlertakes/status/1348097074772930560?s=20">the platform would be offline for at least a week</a>, as &#8220;they rebuild from scratch&#8221; in response to AWS&#8217; communications.</p>
<div id="mod-subbuzz-text-1" class="subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative " data-retailers="Amazon" data-keywords="cleaning,fast fashion" data-module="subbuzz-text">
<p>In the wake of the riots at the Capitol on Wednesday and a purge of accounts accused of inciting violence on Twitter and Facebook, Parler had become the home for a raft of radical voices calling for armed &#8220;Patriots&#8221; to commit violence at the nation&#8217;s capitol and statehouses around the country.</p>
<p>Most recently, conservative militants on the site had been calling for &#8220;Patriots&#8221; to amplify the events of January 6 with a march on Washington DC with weapons on January 19.</p>
<p>Even as pressure was came from Apple and Amazon, <a href="https://twitter.com/AMZNforClimate/status/1347799256883552259">whose employees had called for the suspension of services with the company</a>, Parler was taking steps to moderate posts on its platform.</p>
<p>The company acknowledged that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">removed some posts from Trump supporter Lin Wood</a>, who had called for the execution of Vice President Mike Pence in a series of proclamations on the company&#8217;s site.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Republican lawmakers including <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=5218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sen. Ted Cruz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DevinNunes/status/1326700669579882497?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Congressman Devin Nunes</a> — along with conservative firebrands like Wood have found a home on the platform, where they can share conspiracy theories with abandon.</p>
<p>In an email quoted by BuzzFeed News, Amazon Web Services&#8217; Trust and Safety Team told Parler&#8217;s chief policy officer, Amy Peikoff that calls for violence that were spreading across Parler&#8217;s platform violated its terms of service. The company&#8217;s team also said that Parler&#8217;s plan to use volunteers to moderate content on the platform would prove effective, according to BuzzFeed.</p>
<p>“Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service,” BuzzFeed reported the email as saying.</p>
</div>
<div id="mod-subbuzz-text-3" class="subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative " data-retailers="Amazon" data-keywords="cleaning,fast fashion" data-module="subbuzz-text">
<p>Here’s Amazon’s letter to Parler in full.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Amy,</p>
<p>Thank you for speaking with us earlier today.</p>
<p>As we discussed on the phone yesterday and this morning, we remain troubled by the repeated violations of our terms of service. Over the past several weeks, we’ve reported 98 examples to Parler of posts that clearly encourage and incite violence. Here are a few examples below from the ones we’ve sent previously: [See images above.]</p>
<p>Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service. It also seems that Parler is still trying to determine its position on content moderation. You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency. Your CEO recently stated publicly that he doesn’t “feel responsible for any of this, and neither should the platform.” This morning, you shared that you have a plan to more proactively moderate violent content, but plan to do so manually with volunteers. It’s our view that this nascent plan to use volunteers to promptly identify and remove dangerous content will not work in light of the rapidly growing number of violent posts. This is further demonstrated by the fact that you still have not taken down much of the content that we’ve sent you. Given the unfortunate events that transpired this past week in Washington, D.C., there is serious risk that this type of content will further incite violence.</p>
<p>AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site. However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others. Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler’s account effective Sunday, January 10th, at 11:59PM PST. We will ensure that all of your data is preserved for you to migrate to your own servers, and will work with you as best as we can to help your migration.</p>
<p>&#8211; AWS Trust &amp; Safety Team</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> confirmed that it has suspended the conservative social media app Parler from the App Store, shortly after Google banned it from Google Play. The app, which became a home to Trump supporters and several high-profile conservatives in the days leading up to the Capitol riots, had been operating in violation of Apple’s rules.</p>
<p>The company tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity. Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> from the App Store until they resolve these issues.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the wake of its decision Apple sent Parler&#8217;s developers the following note:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the developers of the Parler app,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response regarding dangerous and harmful content on Parler. We have determined that the measures you describe are inadequate to address the proliferation of dangerous and objectionable content on your app.</p>
<p>Parler has not upheld its commitment to moderate and remove harmful or dangerous content encouraging violence and illegal activity, and is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.</p>
<p>In your response, you referenced that Parler has been taking this content “very seriously for weeks.” However, the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action in violation of Guideline 1.1 &#8211; Safety &#8211; Objectionable Content.</p>
<p>Your response also references a moderation plan “for the time being,” which does not meet the ongoing requirements in Guideline 1.2 &#8211; Safety &#8211; User Generated content. While there is no perfect system to prevent all dangerous or hateful user content, apps are required to have robust content moderation plans in place to proactively and effectively address these issues. A temporary “task force” is not a sufficient response given the widespread proliferation of harmful content.</p>
<p>For these reasons, your app will be removed from the App Store until we receive an update that is compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines and you have demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>App Review Board</p></blockquote>
<p>Conservative commentator and Parler investor Dan Bongino posted about Apple&#8217;s decision on the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tech tyrants at Apple have pulled the app from their App Store. Apple is no different than the Chinese communist party in their preference for totalitarian thought control. I’m proud of the remaining liberty-loving people of this great country. And I’m embarrassed, and horrified by the tech totalitarians who’ve taken control of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bongino was among those recently suspended from Twitter. He noted, however, that <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/dan-bongino-quits-twitter-after-suspension/">he had no intention to return to the site</a>.</p>
<p>While Parler is no longer available through the store at present, it seems it will still be available to access for those who have already downloaded it. As The New York Times noted earlier this week,</p>
<blockquote><p>If Apple pulls Parler from the App Store, people would not be able to download the app to their iPhones or iPads. People who had already downloaded the Parler iPhone app would still be able to use it, but the company would not be able to update the app, meaning it would eventually be rendered obsolete as Apple updated the iPhone software.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Parler&#8217;s future remains more uncertain than most, as there&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/acvisneski/status/1347717079533645824">a growing push inside Amazon</a> to pull the plug on Parler, too.</p>

<p>The news comes shortly after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Google banned it from Google Play</a>. The app, which became a home to Trump supporters and several high-profile conservatives in the days leading up the Capitol riots, had been operating in violation of Apple&#8217;s rules, we understand. Apple&#8217;s App Store guidelines require apps hosting user-generated content to have moderation policies to remove content that incites violence.</p>
<p>Despite these policies, neither Apple nor Google had taken action to remove Parler in prior weeks, even though Trump supporters and other far-right users had <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/06/trump-riot-twitter-parler-proud-boys-boogaloos-antifa-qanon/6570794002/">used the app to call for violence </a>and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">organize their plans</a> to storm the Capitol. The insurrection left five people dead, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/four-dead-after-pro-trump-rioters-storm-capitol.html">over 50 police officers injured</a>, and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/thirteen-charged-federal-court-following-riot-united-states-capitol">more than a dozen facing federal charges</a>, in addition to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-01-07/capitol-arrests-in-dc-riots">growing number of arrests</a> emerging as suspects are identified.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler">BuzzFeed News</a> on Friday reported Parler had received a letter from Apple which warned that the app would be removed from the App Store within 24 hours, unless the company submitted a content moderation improvement plan.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s notice read:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We have received numerous complaints regarding objectionable content in your Parler service, accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington D.C. on January 6, 2021 that led (among other things) to loss of life, numerous injuries, and the destruction of property. The app also appears to continue to be used to plan and facilitate yet further illegal and dangerous activities.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>(TechCrunch additionally confirmed BuzzFeed&#8217;s reporting.)</p>
<p>Parler CEO John Matze posted about Apple&#8217;s ultimatum to his own Parler account, saying he would not cave to &#8220;those authoritarians who hate free speech.&#8221; Earlier today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">it was noted that</a> the service reportedly removed a post from Trump associate Lin Wood over calls for violence against Vice President, Mike Pence.</p>

<p>Ahead of its removal, Parler had ranked No. 1 in News on the iPhone App Store and No. 13 Overall, according to data from App Annie. On Friday, it was ranking as high as No. 1, at times, on the iPhone&#8217;s Top Charts of free non-game apps, though final data was not available.</p>

<p>Currently, the app is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS), but it appears to be in violation of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/#:~:text=AWS%20Acceptable%20Use%20Policy.%20This%20Acceptable%20Use%20Policy,examples%20described%20in%20this%20Policy%20are%20not%20exhaustive.">AWS Acceptable Use Policy</a> which could serve as grounds for its removal.</p>
<p>The collective action of tech company employees is playing a key role in some of the decisions being made regarding Trump and his supporters&#8217; access to platforms to communicate and organize in the days following the Capitol riots. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/twitter-trump-dorsey/">The Washington Post</a>, for example, over 350 Twitter employees signed a letter urging CEO Jack Dorsey and other execs to permanently suspend Trump&#8217;s account before the company followed through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It seems that even the &#8220;free speech&#8221; social network <a href="https://parler.com/">Parler</a> has its limits.</p>
<p>The social network that has attracted scores of conservative commentators because of its commitment to free speech has taken down several posts from Trump affiliate Lin Wood, <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/pro-trump-lawyer-lin-wood-calls-for-pence-to-be-executed-posts-get-removed-from-parler/">according to a report in <em>Mediaite</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>In one of the posts removed from the social media platform, Wood called for the execution of Vice President <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/pence-mike" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="pence-mike">Mike Pence <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wood adds on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that he is currently serving a Twitter suspension. <a href="https://t.co/JqvF0VM2gu">pic.twitter.com/JqvF0VM2gu</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a statement to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mediaite" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mediaite">Mediaite, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Parler chief executive John Matze confirmed that the service had taken action against Wood&#8217;s posts to the platform.</p>
<p>“Yes, some of his parleys that violated our rules were taken down,” Matze told Mediaite. “Including the ones you are talking about.”</p>
<p>The move from Parler is significant because it would mark one of the first instances of a high profile conservative figure having their content removed from the service.</p>
<p>Parler, despite its reputation as a social platform dedicated to free speech, does have some rules governing content.</p>
<p>And, as Mediaite flagged, the posts from Wood likely ran afoul of a rule in the company&#8217;s terms of service that states &#8220;reported parleys, comments, or messages sent using our service will be deemed a violation of these Guidelines if they contain: an explicit or implicit encouragement to use violence, or to commit a lawless action, such that: (a) the Parleyer intends his or her speech to result in the use of violence or lawless action, and (b) the imminent use of violence or lawless action is the likely result of the parley, comment, or message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wood, whose account remains active on Parler, had his <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> account suspended on Thursday, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2021/01/07/lin-wood-lawyer-closely-tied-to-trump-permanently-banned-from-twitter-after-claiming-capitol-siege-was-staged/?sh=7594929e1be3">as Forbes reported at the time</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the incitements to execute Pence seem to have been the animating factor for at least some of the rioters who stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congrats on surviving this wild first week of 2021. Outside all-things political, a few labor developments happened that are worth noting. Also, shortly before the mob of Trump supporters wreaked havoc on the U.S. Capitol, I caught up with Dr. Timnit Gebru, the prominent AI ethics researcher who said she was fired from Google last month for speaking out about diversity issues. Our full conversation will be available to listen to next Saturday on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/techcrunch-mixtape/id1317432118">the newest episode of TC Mixtape</a>, but I’ve included some snippets for y’all below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up here to get Human Capital delivered straight to your inbox every Friday at 1 p.m. PT. </span></p>
<p><b>Google, Alphabet workers unionize</b></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-alphabet-employees-union/">200 Google and Alphabet workers announced the formation of the Alphabet Workers Union</a>. With the help of Communication Workers of America Union’s Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE-CWA), the union will be open to both employees and contractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the roughly 227 workers who had signed on to support the union as of earlier this week, they all committed to set aside 1% of their yearly compensation to go toward union dues. Those dues will be used to help compensate folks for lost wages in the event of a strike. The bulk of the workers who have signed on are mostly based in offices in the San Francisco Bay Area and one in Cambridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, though, the Alphabet Workers Union is a bit untraditional. The current union consists of just 227 workers out of Alphabet’s 132,121 people. For the Alphabet union, the intent is not necessarily to be able to bargain with Alphabet-owned companies but to be able to work collectively toward common goals.</span></p>
<p><b>Labor department issues filing ruling re: gig workers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Labor </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa/2021-independent-contractor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued a final rule pertaining to gig workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The rule, which goes into effect March 8, 2021, makes it easier for gig economy companies like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart to legally classify workers as independent contractors throughout the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it remains to be seen if this rule will fully manifest under the new leadership of President-Elect Joe Biden, who is set to be inaugurated on Jan 20, 2021. </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-department-finalizes-independent-contractor-rule-11609943031?mod=hp_lead_pos4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Wall Street Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki previously pointed to the labor rule as an example of regulation Biden could stop or delay on his inauguration day. </span></p>
<p><b>Independent Drivers Guild Chicago forms</b></p>
<p><a href="https://drivingguild.org/welcome-chicago/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rideshare drivers in Chicago recently teamed up with Independent Drivers Guild</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to launch a local branch of the drivers’ rights organization. IDG, which is affiliated with the Machinists Union, has historically advocated for the rights of rideshare drivers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“IDG beat the odds to win higher pay and benefits for drivers in New York City and working together, we know we can do the same here in Chicago,” Steven Everett, a Chicago rideshare driver-organizer, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><b>What’s next for Dr. Timnit Gebru</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of you are likely familiar with Dr. Timnit Gebru, but the TL;DR is that she recently left Google after speaking out about diversity issues in artificial intelligence. Google says Gebru resigned and it merely accepted her resignation, while Gebru says Google fired her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I caught up with Dr. Gebru on Wednesday to chat about what’s next for her, as well as some recent developments in tech’s labor struggles.</span></p>
<p><b>On the Alphabet Workers Union:</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a combination of a lot of peoples work and frustration. And i think this is the only way because this is a way to give workers power, and so that they can be at the negotiating table, because right now, they don’t have power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;] One thing I really appreciate about this union is that it’s all workers. It’s not just, you know, full time workers, it’s temp workers and full-time workers, which is extremely important because the tech industry is right now running on the backs of these contract workers who have zero security.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;] What I worry about though, is that [Google has] been extremely aggressive with trying to union  bust and trying to stop these kinds of organizing &#8212; any type of organizing and now that it’s become something real, I think  they’re going to intensify their efforts, like a lot more in trying to stop this organizing from happening. And there are many well-known tactics to do this, right. This kind of like propaganda and kind of dividing and conquering and all that. So that’s my worry. And I think everybody needs to stay vigilant to make sure that that doesn’t happen.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>On fighting for severance:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know if I’m going to, you know, explain to you exactly what I’m thinking right now about that,” she said, adding that “I definitely have lawyers.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, what they did to me was wrong and I definitely want to, you know, take some sort of action but what that is is not necessarily crystal clear.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>On working at a tech company again</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to joining Google, Dr. Gebru held roles at Apple and Microsoft. While, she still plans to work in the field of artificial intelligence ethics and work with Black in AI, Dr. Gebru said “it’s very hard for me to imagine joining a corporation right now.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m just sick of these institutions because you spend so much of your energy, fighting for simple things, just simple things that people don&#8217;t have any incentive to change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;] I want to spend more time thinking about how we can have our own institutions rather than just you know, fighting these people over and over again. That&#8217;s my current thinking.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envisioning a firm or a non-profit that does what the ethical AI team at Google was doing under her leadership, but that’s not affiliated with any corporation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to create technology that would also work for us, rather than just playing catch up,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So I think that’s the idea of Black in AI.”</span></p>

<hr />
<p>So much for a quiet start to the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Any hopes of 2021 giving us respite from the turbulent waters of 2020 went splat, as the first week of the New Year was busy with venture capital deals (Divvy! Gtmhub!), IPO news (Affirm! Poshmark! Roblox!), SPAC news (SoFi! BuzzFeed!), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/tech-leaders-speak-out-about-platforms-roles-in-us-capitol-riots/">violence in the American capital</a>. We’ll get to all of that in a minute, minus the political stuff as I don’t have the heart to scream again before the work week is over.</p>
<p>Today we’re starting with two growth stories, one from a company that is nearing IPO scale, and the other from a startup that is just getting its feet underneath it after a product launch.</p>
<p>We’ll start with <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a>, a media-focused software company that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/cloudinary-passes-60m-arr-without-vc-money/">covered in early 2020</a>, when the bootstrapped company announced that it had reached $60 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR. I caught up with the private upstart again this week to check in on what it was like to bootstrap through a pandemic.</p>
<p>Cloudinary co-founder and CEO Itai Lahan told TechCrunch that his company has reached $80 million ARR, or 33% growth during a very busy year. Not bad, right? But according to Lahan, Cloudinary had targeted a number over $90 million for the year. So what happened?</p>
<p>Well, Cloudinary intentionally decelerated a little bit.</p>
<p>Lahan walked TechCrunch through how Cloudinary dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, which had an impact on parts of its customer base. Lahan and the rest of the company decided to slow down, he said, reducing the pace at which it was hiring, among other initiatives. The goal was to get the company through the pandemic, switch to remote work with its culture intact, he said.</p>
<p><em><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/army-air-force-exchange-service" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="army-air-force-exchange-service">The Exchange <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is looking for startups between $35 million and $60 million ARR that are growing quickly and are willing to share performance metrics. </em><a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com"><em>Email in if that’s you</em></a><em>. More on the project </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/one-final-100m-arr-company-and-the-startups-we-want-to-meet-in-2021/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>The gap between the company’s $80 million ARR result and its original goal was a mix of COVID-19’s commercial impact and the company’s own choices, Lahan said.</p>
<p>When’s the last time I heard the CEO of a private technology company tell me that they were making conscious choices to slow their company down? I honestly don’t remember. Lahan had reasons, however, that went past <em>not</em> having recently raised $100 million or whatever. Instead, the company decided to exchange short-term financial growth for what the CEO described variously as long-term growth or sustainable growth.</p>
<p>Lahan said that if Cloudinary focuses on its customers and employees over short-term financial goals, it will grow more in the next half-decade than it will if it decided to sprint as fast as it could today. One example of the choice to go a little slower in 2020? The company has around 285 people today, under its original plan to have around 320.</p>
<p>Wild, right? This is all possible because Lahan and his team at once don’t have to answer to external investors with short, or medium-term time frames in mind for liquidity, and because Cloudinary makes secondary liquidity available to its workers, alleviating internal agitating for an IPO.</p>
<p>Not that we would <em>mind</em> Cloudinary going public so we could dig into its numbers more deeply. It should cross $100 million ARR this year, so it’s nearly time to start sending it regular, annoying emails.</p>
<p>Now on to our smaller company: OnJuno! If Cloudinary is nearly ready to go public, OnJuno is getting ready to think about a Series A. So it’s just a <em>little</em> bit younger.</p>
<p>TechCrunch first spoke with <a href="https://onjuno.com/">OnJuno</a> in December, right after it launched, trying to figure out why the world needed another neobank of sorts. According to co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/varundeshpande14/">Varun Deshpande</a>, OnJuno is targeted at <em>affluent</em> individuals, while other neobanks have more traditionally targeted less-wealthy customers.</p>
<p>OnJuno entices them with higher interest rates, and a focus on what Deshpande described as the more debit-focused Asian American community. How is it going? We checked back in with OnJuno, about three-and-a-half weeks after it launched. Per Deshpande, OnJuno expects to reach the $10 million assets under management (AUM) threshold shortly, with users bringing average deposits of $7,000 to $8,000. That’s a multiple of some other neobanks, the startup said.</p>
<p>The fintech upstart said that it expects to reach $100 million AUM in the next two to three quarters, adding that around 80% of its users come <em>from</em> traditional banks. Let’s see how fast it can reach $25 million AUM, and if its deposit averages hold up.</p>
<p>Now, venture rounds, IPOs news, and then &#8212; I am sorry &#8212; some SPAC news we need to discuss.</p>
<h2>Venture capital</h2>
<p>Despite it being the first minutes and hours and days of 2021, so very much happened. To pick an example, we have now seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/with-5-new-unicorns-in-first-week-of-2021-are-we-in-for-a-stampede-this-year/">around a half dozen new unicorns born</a>, with another group in the provisional camp.</p>
<p>The pace of new unicorn creation feels exciting, but as we’re still too close to Q4 2020 for comfort, I don’t want to call this a trend yet. But as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/divvy-raises-165m-as-the-spend-management-space-stays-red-hot/">Divvy puts $165 million</a> to work at a $1.6 billion valuation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">Hinge Health blasts to a $3 billion valuation</a> and Salesloft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/with-5-new-unicorns-in-first-week-of-2021-are-we-in-for-a-stampede-this-year/">meets the mark and more</a>, it’s been busy.</p>
<p>On the slightly-smaller-but-still-very-interesting side of the VC coin, Bangalore-based Jumbotail <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/jumbotail-raises-14-2-million-for-its-wholesale-marketplace-in-india/">picked up $14.2 million</a> this week to help it pursue what we called “the opportunity to digitize neighborhood stores in the world’s second-largest internet market.” That actually sounds cool? And important?</p>
<p>And in an even smaller round, Atlanta, Georgia-based Voxie <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/voxie-series-a/">raised a $6.7 million in Series A</a>. Voxie “offers tools to help businesses automate and manage” their text message-based marketing. This shows how much space there still is in the software market for new startups. I would have bet you an espresso that we had tapped out the text messaging startup space three years ago. Nope!</p>
<p>Coming up, some re-digs into startup clusters. After looking at how quickly startups building corporate-cards-and-software businesses are growing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">we’re dipping back into software startups building OKR software</a>. If that’s you, <a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com">get your data in</a> or be left out.</p>
<h2>IPOs</h2>
<p>Zooming out from our regular coverage of IPOs, here’s what you need to know: Affirm and Poshmark are pursuing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/affirm-targets-up-to-38-per-share-in-ipo-pushing-its-valuation-above-9b/"><em>traditional</em> IPOs</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/at-35-to-39-per-share-poshmarks-ipo-could-5x-its-last-private-valuation/"><em>huge markups</em></a> to their final private valuations. That means that the 2021 IPO market is kicking off like a mirror to the late-2020 IPO market. Expect some big pops in coming months for some companies you know by name.</p>
<p>The other bit of news that matters is that Roblox has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">scrapped its IPO plans</a>, raised an enormous brick of cash, and now intends to direct list. <em>Why</em> is a perfectly fine question to ask, and one that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">tried to answer here</a>.</p>
<p>Takeaways? The IPO market will be active, and perhaps more diverse than expected in 2021. At least to start.</p>
<h2>SPACs (alas)</h2>
<p>While you are tired and bored of SPACs, and I am as well, they are actually doing things at last that we do care about. In brief to respect your time and sanity:</p>
<ul>
<li>BuzzFeed <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/buzzfeed-has-held-discussions-with-rascoffs-spac">might go public via a SPAC</a>. Our verdict: That shit’s bodacious and we want to see BuzzFeed News have as much loot as possible to keep up <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/xinjiang-camps-china-factories-forced-labor">its critical reporting</a>.</li>
<li>SoFi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/sofi-nears-deal-to-go-public-in-merger-with-chamath-palihapitiyas-newest-spac/">might go public via a SPAC</a>, you can read the investor deck <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001952/tm211973d1_ex99-2.htm">here</a>, which seems dumb. Why not just go public? But as Chamath is involved, this one is going to do a <em>lot</em> of press.</li>
<li>Bustle <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bustle-m-a/bustle-hires-bank-to-explore-deal-to-go-public-source-idUSKBN29C33T">could go public via a SPAC</a>. Our verdict: Wait, really?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Odds/Ends</h2>
<p>Lots of venture capital funds raised capital, which we yammered about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-might-be-the-fastest-growth-story-of-this-era/">here</a> on the podcast. But I wanted to throw one more into the mix: Transformation Capital, which put together <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2021/01/08/transformation-capital-launches-500m-digital-health-fund/%5C">a $500 million fund focused on digital health</a>.</p>
<p>The nice thing about thematic funds, like this and <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/01/usv-climate-fund/">USV’s new climate fund</a>, is that you actually know what they do. Which in the case of Transformation Capital, is investing “investing in commercial-stage digital health companies,” in its own words. Word.</p>
<p>This is the second such fund from the group, which now has $800 million under management. Cool.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Want this newsletter in your inbox every Saturday morning? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here.</a></em></p>
<p>In the past few months, there hasn’t been one conversation I’ve had about remote work that doesn’t include a mention of Hopin, a virtual events platform last valued at $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>For a company only a little older than a year, Hopin has a wild growth story. It grew its ARR from $0 to $20 million in nine months. It scooped up two businesses to differentiate its business, including StreamYard <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-buys-livestreaming-startup-streamyard-for-250m-as-it-looks-to-expand-its-product-lineup/ ">for $250 million</a> just this week. And its last financing round left the company’s valuation at $2.1 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hopin’s growth amid Zoom’s fatigue is giving validation to a whole crop of remote-work-focused startups. I see startups in the category sitting in two camps: Either you’re betting that users want a more passive way to interact with video or you’re betting that users want a more active way to interact with video.</p>
<p>This week, for example, I wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/rewatch-seed/">Rewatch</a>, which creates internal private channels for startups to archive all their videoconferencing meetings. The company is essentially turning live meetings into transcribed documents that employees can sift through on their own time, shifting from synchronous to asynchronous.</p>
<p>In contrast, I also covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/ ">Teamflow</a>, a platform that wants to give a virtual space to companies to recreate the serendipity and productivity of an office. Unlike Rewatch, Teamflow thinks that employees want there to be more live moments in a distributed world.</p>
<p>Both previously in-stealth companies cited Hopin as an example of the need for innovation around how we interact virtually. Rewatch and Teamflow, respectively, see Zoom as a plug-in or competitor &#8211; not inspiration.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-might-be-the-fastest-growth-story-of-this-era/?tpcc=ECTW2020">this week’s podcast</a>, it’s a dynamic I expect to play out even more over the next few months, as we evolve from a Zoom world to a Zoom alternative world. I want to hear from you, even if you disagree, about what companies in the remote work space should be on my radar. E-mail me at <a href="mailto:natasha.m@techcrunch.com">natasha.mascarenhas@techcrunch.com</a> or tweet me <a href="http://The power of platform">@nmasc_</a> with companies you think should be on my remote-work radar.</p>
<h2><strong>The power of platform</strong></h2>
<p>This week, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://techcrunch.com/tag/capitol-riot&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1610142154051000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xYNZyrGHa0hdVQDxSu0Vl">U.S. Capitol building was stormed</a> by pro-Trump insurrectionists in a fatal riot. Many in the tech community blamed Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg for not limiting hate speech on their respective platforms, thus stoking flames of domestic terrorism.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/vcs-dispense-with-political-niceties-during-capitol-riots-never-talk-to-me-again/">VCs dispense with niceties during Capitol riots: ‘Never talk to me again’</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/tech-leaders-speak-out-about-platforms-roles-in-us-capitol-riots/">Tech leaders point out platforms’ role in Capitol riots</a>’</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">banned Trump for 2 weeks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">Twitter permanently suspended President Trump</a></li>
<li>Reddit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/reddit-taking-action-on-site-violations-as-rioters-storm-us-capitol/">promised to take action</a></li>
<li>Shopify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">pulled Trump’s stores off its website.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Even as many see the response as too little too late, the events mark a crucial change in the way that regulation between government and tech works.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/HipCityReg">Reggie James</a>, CEO and founder of Eternal, framed the issue in a<a href="https://twitter.com/HipCityReg/status/1347190338784473088 "> tweet:</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2><strong>FTC versus DTC</strong></h2>
<p>Sticking to our government and tech theme, P&amp;G has officially<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/pg-terminates-plan-to-acquire-razor-startup-billie-following-ftc-lawsuit/"> terminated its plan</a> to acquire razor startup, Billie, after the FTC sued over antitrust concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Billie was founded in 2017 with the goal of fighting the “pink tax” on goods marketed to women, including razors and body wash. It was going to be acquired by P&amp;G after raising just $35 million in venture capital.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/billie-which-wants-to-destroy-the-pink-tax-closes-a-6m-seed-round-for-its-razor-subscription-service/">Here’s our seed coverage</a> of the startup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>Direct-to-consumer brands <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-pgs-acquisition-of-billie-a-razor-startup-for-women/">are not happy</a>. The failed deal is not-so-subtly signaling to DTC brands that there is a cap to their scale, at least in the FTC’s eyes. Government regulation and limited scale also could hurt VC interest in the category.</p>
<p>The optimistic news is that VC funding might <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/why-vc-funding-is-falling-out-of-favor-with-top-d2c-brands/ ">be falling out of favor with top D2C brands. </a></p>
<p>Many product-based brands, as it turns out, are no longer interested in chasing venture capital, playing the “grow-at-all-costs” game and relinquishing partial control to investors, despite the pandemic and the uncertain circumstances many founders find themselves facing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Users are surging on small, conservative, social media platforms after President Donald Trump&#8217;s ban from the world&#8217;s largest social networks, even as those platforms are seeing access throttled by the app marketplaces of tech&#8217;s biggest players.</p>
<p>The social network, <a href="https://parler.com/">Parler</a>, a network that mimics Twitter, is now the number one app in Apple&#8217;s app store and Gab, another conservative-backed service, <a href="https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1347936722265391114?s=20">claimed that it was seeing an explosion in the number of signups to its web-based platform as well</a>.</p>

<p>Parler&#8217;s ballooning user base comes at a potentially perilous time for the company. It has already been removed from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Play store and Apple is considering suspending the social media app as well if it does not add some content moderation features.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Both Parler and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gab-online" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gab-online">Gab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> have billed themselves as havens for free speech, with what&#8217;s perhaps the most lax content moderation online. In the past the two companies have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/07/russian-trolls-graphika-parler-gab/">left up content posted by an alleged Russian disinformation campaign,</a> and allow users to traffic in conspiracy theories that other social media platforms have shut down.</p>
<p>The expectation with these services is that users on the platforms are in charge of muting and blocking trolls or offensive content, but, by their nature, those who join these platforms will generally find themselves among like-minded users.</p>
<p>Their user counts might be surging, but would-be adopters may soon have a hard time finding the services.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday night, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google </a>said that it would be removing <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler</a> from their Play Store immediately &#8212; suspending the app until the developers committed to a moderation and enforcement policy that could handle objectionable content on the platform.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.“</p></blockquote>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler">Buzzfeed News</a> reported that Parler had received a letter from Apple informing them that the app would be removed from the App Store within 24 hours unless the company submitted an update with a moderation improvement plan. Parler CEO John Matze confirmed the action from Apple in a post on his Parler account where he posted a screenshot of the notification from Apple.</p>
<p>“We want to be clear that Parler is in fact responsible for all the user generated content present on your service and for ensuring that this content meets App Store requirements for the safety and protection of our users,” text from the screenshot reads. “We won’t distribute apps that present dangerous and harmful content.</p>
<p>Parler is backed by the conservative billionaire heiress Rebekah Mercer, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/parler-backed-by-mercer-family-makes-play-for-conservatives-mad-at-facebook-twitter-11605382430">according to a November report in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. Founded in 2018, the service has experienced spikes in user adoption with every clash between more social media companies and the outgoing President Trump. In November, Parler boasted some 10 million users, according to the Journal.</p>
<p>Users like Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo and the conservative talk show host Dan Bongino, a wildly popular figure on Facebook who is also an investor in Parler, have joined the platform. In the Journal article Bongino called the company “a collective middle finger to the tech tyrants.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Parler and Gab aren&#8217;t the only companies to see users numbers soar after the Trump bans. MeWe Network, OANN, Newsmax and Rumble have also seen adoption soar, according to data from the analytics company Apptopia.</p>
<p>The company noted that Parler was the #1 app on the iOS app store for two days surging from 18th on Thursday and 592 on Wednesday. Overall, the app was the 10th most downloaded social media app in 2020 with 8.1 million new installs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an event driven app though,&#8221; a company analyst noted. &#8220;After events like the election, BLM protests, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> first applying labels to Trump’s Tweets, we see bursts of downloads and usage but it will then drop off.&#8221;</p>

<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 204 billion downloads and $120 billion in global consumer spend in 2019.

<p>Not including third-party Chinese app stores, iOS and Android users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">downloaded</a> 130 billion apps in 2020.

<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business.

<h3>Social apps boot Trump following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/capitol-riot/">Capitol riot</a></h3>
<p>To varying degrees, social apps had to quickly figure out where to draw the line on allowing Trump to continue to use their platforms this week, after his false claims about a rigged election led Trump supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, destroying property, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/07/cybersecurity-202-riot-capitol-is-nightmare-scenario-cybersecurity-professionals/">stealing</a> at least one computer, potentially gaining access <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/decrypted-how-bad-was-the-us-capitol-breach-for-cybersecurity/">to other unlocked computers</a> and causing chaos that led to five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer who has now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/us/brian-sicknick-police-capitol-dies.html">died of injuries</a> sustained on duty.</p>

<p>Social platforms, however, have been complicit in allowing these dangerous and radicalized groups to emerge in the first place. Facebook, for example, allowed StoptheSteal and Secession groups <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online">to organize</a> using its platform. It also waited years to sweep the platform of QAnon groups, and then didn&#8217;t even finish the job &#8212; these disinformation networks remain live on the platform today. But even smaller gestures aimed at cleaning up the mess of a platform that prioritized ad dollars over safety led some Trump supporters to flee to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/protesters-storm-capitol-hill-building.html">other social media networks</a> used by the far-right, such as Gab and Parler. There, they could post even more violent rhetoric without repercussions.</p>

<p>Following the riot, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">announced</a> Trump would be banned from both Facebook and Instagram for two weeks. Twitter initially locked Trump&#8217;s account on Wednesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">then allowed him to return</a> after deleting a few tweets, noting that another violation would result in permanent suspension. On Friday, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">permanently banned</a> Trump, and his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/twitter-qanon-sidney-powell-michael-flynn-ron-watkins/">other close associates.</a></p>
<p>Both also removed Trump&#8217;s video where he showed support for rioters, telling them to go home but also &#8220;we love you, you&#8217;re very special.&#8221;</p>
<p>TikTok, though obviously not used by Trump, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/tiktok-bans-videos-of-trump-inciting-mob-blocks-stormthecapital-and-other-hashtags/">took down re-shares of Trump&#8217;s video</a>, but allowed counter speech against it and some posts by news organizations. And it proactively blocked the hashtags used by rioters. Snapchat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/snapchat-locks-president-donald-trumps-account/">locked</a> Trump&#8217;s account as well, and Twitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/">disabled</a> him until the end of his term.</p>

<p>New social apps and startups with social features will often mimic the general approaches of the large platforms as they craft their own content policies. But human rights organizations argue that what’s being done is not enough.</p>
<p>Said activist group <a href="https://colorofchange.org/press_release/color-of-change-facebook-must-permanently-ban-trump-and-take-action-against-his-enablers/">Color of Change</a> this week, &#8220;Mark Zuckerberg does not deserve applause for taking action at the 11th hour, after years of damage has already been done. Facebook is unquestionably complicit in the violent insurrection on Capitol Hill yesterday, and in the erosion of our democracy that’s continued to unfold in plain sight.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The group is urging for Trump&#8217;s permanent ban from Facebook and for the network to &#8220;take action against his enablers and allies who continue to use the platform to incite violence and spread dangerous misinformation.&#8221;</p>
<h3>App Stores take action on Parler</h3>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler">Buzzfeed News</a> reported Parler had received a letter from Apple that said they had 24 hours to come up with a moderation plan for the app, otherwise it would be banned from the App Store. Google Play, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">more quickly banned the app on Friday</a> until the company could commit to a moderation and enforcement policy to handle objectionable content on its network.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s statement reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content.

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler removed from Google Play store as Apple App Store suspension reportedly looms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/embed/#?secret=OkQzcPbGWL" data-secret="OkQzcPbGWL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Parler had been one of the places where Trump supporters and other extremists to organized their plans to storm the Capitol this week as well as plan future attacks. Posts on Parler, which has a looser moderation policy compared with Twitter, often call for people&#8217;s deaths and even for Civil War.</p>
<p>Several high-profile conservatives, including members of Trump&#8217;s family, had been participating on Parler, following the increased enforcement of various polices against election misinformation and false claims about COVID-19, among other things, on mainstream social platforms.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for Apple and Google to take action against apps with harmful content, though one has to wonder why it took a deadly insurrection aimed at toppling U.S. democratic processes for them to care.</p>
<h3>U.S. bans transactions with Chinese payments apps</h3>
<p>Ahead of the violence at the Capitol this week, the Trump administration continued its crackdown on Chinese mobile applications. Via an executive order signed on Tuesday, the U.S. banned transactions with eight Chinese mobile apps, including Ant Group’s Alipay mobile payment app, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-tech-exclusive-idUSKBN29A2PA">Reuters first reported</a>.</p>
<p>Others named in the order include CamScanner, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate (published by Alibaba Group subsidiary UCWeb) and Beijing Kingsoft Office Software’s WPS Office.</p>
<p>The move is meant to cut off China&#8217;s access to U.S. user data, including, per the order, the ability for China to &#8220;track the locations of federal employees and contractors&#8221; and &#8220;build dossiers of personal information.&#8221;</p>
<p>The administration had previously banned TikTok and WeChat, but U.S. courts blocked the orders from going into effect.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile advertising company Tapjoy <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/ftc-requires-mobile-advertising-company-stop-misleading-users">settled with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over allegations</a> that it was misleading consumers about the in-app rewards they could earn in mobile games. The FTC said Tapjoy deceived consumers who participated in various activities — like purchasing a product, signing up for a free trial, providing their personal information like an email address or completing a survey — in exchange for in-game virtual currency. But when it was time to pay up, Tapjoy’s partners didn’t deliver.</p>
<p>The order will now require Tapjoy to follow up on complaints and monitor to ensure that offers are delivered, or face further fines of up to $43,280 per each violation.</p>
<p>Tapjoy serves as a middleman between developers, consumers and advertisers, and is one of many &#8220;offerwall&#8221;-based mobile ad networks available today.</p>
<p>Mobile game developers integrate Tapjoy&#8217;s technology to display ads — aka “offers” — to their customers, in order to earn payments for their users’ activity. When the consumer completes the offer by taking whatever action was required, they’re supposed to earn in-game coins or other virtual currency. The app developers then earn a percentage of that ad revenue. But the FTC said that would often not happen, and Tapjoy ignored hundreds of thousands of consumer complaints.</p>
<p>Though Tapjoy was the business being held accountable in the FTC&#8217;s ruling, the Commissioners harshly scolded the &#8220;rent-seeking&#8221; app store business model for allowing networks like Tapjoy to rise in the first place. Using language that strongly hinted that regulation of the app stores was on the way, the Commissioners scolded the app stores&#8217; &#8220;vast power to impose taxes and regulations on the mobile gaming industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This market structure also has cascading effects on gamers and consumers,&#8221; the ruling stated. &#8220;Under heavy taxation by Apple and Google, developers have been forced to adopt alternative monetization models that rely on surveillance, manipulation, and other harmful practices,” it said.</p>
<p>Apple is being given a lot of credit in recent weeks for its privacy push, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">the launch of its so-called app store “nutrition labels”</a> that help to better highlight the bad actors in the mobile app market. But some of the recent reporting neglects to explain why these alternative business models rose in the first place or detail how Apple will financially benefit from the shift to subscriptions that will result from the mobile ad clampdown. It’s also rarely noted that Apple itself serves behavioral advertising within its own apps that is based on the user data it collects from across its catalog of first-party apps and services. That’s not to say that Apple isn’t doing a service with its privacy push, but it’s a complex matter. This isn’t sports; you don’t have to pick one side or the other.</p>
<p>The FTC then not-too-subtly warned Apple and Google that it &#8220;will need to use all of its tools — competition, consumer protection, and data protection — to combat middlemen mischief, including by the largest gaming gatekeepers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of placid admonishments, the tech world came out in force against President Trump this past week following the violent assault of the U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C. on Wednesday. From <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to PayPal, more than a dozen companies have placed unprecedented restrictions or outright banned the current occupant of the White House from using their services, and in some cases, some of his associates and supporters as well.</p>
<p>The news was voluminous and continuous for the past few days, so here’s a recap of who took action when, and what might happen next.</p>
<h2 id="Twitter: a permanent ban and a real-time attempt to shut down all possible account alternatives">Twitter: a permanent ban and a real-time attempt to shut down all possible account alternatives</h2>
<p>Twitter has played a paramount role over the debate about how to moderate President Trump’s communications, given the president’s penchant for the platform and the nearly 90 million followers on his @realDonaldTrump account. In the past, Twitter has repeatedly warned the president, added labels related to electron integrity and misinformation, and outright blocked the occasional tweet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, however, Twitter’s patience seemed to have been exhausted. Shortly after the riots at the Capitol on Wednesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">Twitter put in place a large banner warning its users</a> about the president’s related tweet on the matter, blocking retweets of that specific message. A few hours later, the company instituted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">a 12-hour ban on the president’s personal account</a>.</p>
<p>At first, it looked like the situation would return to normal, with Twitter offering Thursday morning that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">it would reinstate the president’s account after he removed tweets</a> the company considered against its policies around inciting violence. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/is-trump-back-on-twitter/">The president posted a tweet later on Thursday</a> with a video attachment that seemed to be relatively calmer than his recent fiery rhetoric, a video in which he also accepted the country’s election results for the first time.</p>
<p>Enormous pressure externally on its own platform as well as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/twitter-trump-dorsey/">internal demands from employees</a> kept the policy rapidly changing though. Late Friday night, the company announced that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">decided to permanently ban the president from its platform</a>, shutting down @realDonaldTrump. The company then played a game of whack-a-mole as it blocked the president’s access to affiliated Twitter handles like @TeamTrump (his official campaign account) as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/president-trump-responds-to-twitter-account-ban-in-tweet-storm-from-potus-account/">the official presidential account @POTUS</a> and deleted individual tweets from the president. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">The company’s policies state</a> that a blocked user may not attempt to use a different account to evade its ban.</p>
<p>Twitter has also taken other actions against some of the president’s affiliates and broader audience, blocking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/twitter-qanon-sidney-powell-michael-flynn-ron-watkins/">Michael Flynn, a bunch of other Trump supporters, and a variety of QAnon figures</a>.</p>
<p>With a new president on the horizon, the official @POTUS account will be handed to the new Biden administration, although <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/twitters-potus-account-will-reportedly-be-reset-to-zero-followers-when-biden-takes-over/">Twitter has reportedly been intending to reset the account’s followers to zero</a>, unlike its transition of the account in 2016 from Obama to Trump.</p>
<p>As for Trump himself, a permanent ban from his most prominent platform begs the question: where will he take his braggadocio and invective next? So far, we haven’t seen the president move his activities to any social network alternatives, but after the past few years (and on Twitter, the last decade), it seems hard to believe the president will merely return to his golf course and quietly ride out to the horizon.</p>

<h2 id="Snap: a quick lock after dampening the president’s audience for months">Snap: a quick lock after dampening the president’s audience for months</h2>
<p>Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/snapchat-locks-president-donald-trumps-account/">locked the president’s account</a> late Wednesday following the events on Capitol Hill, and seemed to be one of the most poised tech companies to rapidly react to the events taking place in DC. Snap’s lock prevents the president from posting new snaps to his followers on the platform, which currently number approximately two million. As far as TechCrunch knows, that lock remains in place, although the president’s official profile is still available to users.</p>
<p>Following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the concomitant Black Lives Matter protests, <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/we-stand-together">the company had announced back in June</a> that it would remove the president’s account from its curated “Discover” tab, limiting its distribution and discoverability.</p>
<p>The president has never really effectively used the Snap platform, and with an indefinite ban in place, it looks unlikely he will find a home there in the future.</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> like Twitter, is one of the president’s most popular destinations for his supporters, and the platform is also a locus for <a href="https://twitter.com/facebookstop10?lang=en">many of the political right’s most popular personalities</a>. It’s moderation actions have been heavily scrutinized by the press over the past few years, but the company has mostly avoided taking direct action against the president — until this week.</p>
<p>On Wednesday as rioters walked out of the halls of Congress, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-and-youtube-remove-trump-video-calling-extremists-special/">Facebook pulled down a video from President Trump</a> that it considered was promoting violence. Later Wednesday evening, that policy eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">extended into a 24-hour ban of the president’s account</a>, which currently has 33 million likes, or followers. The company argued that the president had violated its policies multiple times, automatically triggering the one-day suspension. At the same time, Facebook (and Instagram) took action to block a popular trending hashtag related to the Capitol riots.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">On Thursday morning</a>, Mark Zuckerberg, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10112681480907401">in a personal post on his own platform</a>, announced an “indefinite” suspension for the president, with a minimum duration of two weeks. That timing would neatly extend the suspension through the inauguration of president-elect Biden, who is to assume the presidency at noon on January 20th.</p>

<p>What will happen after the inauguration? Right now, we don’t know. The president’s account is suspended but not deactivated, which means that the president cannot post new material to his page, but that the page remains visible to Facebook users. The company could remove the suspension once the transition of power is complete, or it may continue the ban longer-term. Given the president’s prominence on the platform and the heavy popularity of the social network among his supporters, Facebook is in a much more intense bind between banning content it deems offensive, and retaining users important to its bottom line.</p>
<h2 id="Shopify / Paypal: Ecommerce platforms won’t sell Trump official merchandise for the time being">Shopify / PayPal: Ecommerce platforms won’t sell Trump official merchandise for the time being</h2>
<p>It’s not just social networks that are blocking the president’s audience — ecommerce giants are also getting into moderating their platforms against the president. On Thursday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">Shopify announced that it was removing the storefronts</a> for both the Trump campaign and Trump’s personal brand.</p>
<p>That’s an evolution on policy for the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/shopify-ceo-attempts-to-defend-continued-hosting-of-breitbarts-online-store/">which years ago said that it would not moderate its platform</a>, but in recent years has removed some controversial stores, such as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-05/shopify-bans-some-right-wing-groups-after-activist-pressure?sref=AwwRcx4b">some right-wing shops in 2018</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> meanwhile has been <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/paypal-and-shopify-remove-trump-related-accounts-citing-policies-against-supporting-violence/">deactivating the accounts of some groups of Trump supporters</a> this week, who were using the money-transfer fintech to coordinate payments to underwrite the rioters’ actions on Capitol Hill. PayPal has been increasingly banning some political accounts, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02E1krqY2KYsmYSubWsxGDVyQtK2w%3A1610206356011&amp;ei=lMz5X5gQy_LmAu_Vg7AE&amp;q=paypal+ban+right+wing&amp;oq=paypal+ban+right+wing&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCCEQqwIyBQghEKsCMgUIIRCrAjoECAAQRzoECCMQJzoFCAAQyQM6AggAOgQIABAKOgYIABAWEB46CAgAEBYQChAeOgUIIRCgAToICCEQFhAdEB46BwghEAoQoAFQsRZYgSFg_SFoAHACeACAAViIAfYFkgECMTGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYqvWOlo_uAhVLuVkKHe_qAEYQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5">banning a far-right activist in 2019</a> and also <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paypal-suspends-dozens-of-racist-groups-sites-altright-com/">banning a spate of far-right organizations</a> in the wake of violent protests in Charlottesville in 2017. These bans have so far not extended directly to the president himself from what TechCrunch can glean.</p>
<p>Given the president’s well-known personal brand and penchant for product tie-ins before becoming president, it’s a major open question about how these two platforms and others in ecommerce will respond to Trump once he leaves office in two weeks. Will the president go back to shilling steaks, water and cologne? And will he need an ecommerce venue to sell his wares online? Much will depend on Trump’s next goals and whether he stays focused on politics, or heads back to his more commercial pursuits.</p>

<h2 id="Google removes Parler from the Google Play Store, while Apple mulls a removal as well">Google removes Parler from the Google Play Store, while Apple mulls a removal as well</h2>
<p>For supporters of Trump and others concerned about the moderation actions of Facebook and other platforms, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has taken the lead as an alternative social network for this audience. Right now, the app is number one in the App Store in the United States, ahead of encrypted and secure messaging app Signal, which is at number four and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">got a massive endorsement from Elon Musk this week</a>.</p>
<p>Parler’s opportunism for growth around the riots on Capitol Hill though has run into a very real barrier: the two tech companies which run the two stores for mobile applications in the United States.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced Friday evening that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">it would be removing the Parler app from its store</a>, citing the social network’s lack of moderation and content filtering capabilities. The app’s page remains down as this article was going to press. That ban means that new users won’t be able to install the app from the Play Store, however, existing users who already have Parler installed will be able to continue using it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Buzzfeed reports that <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler">Apple has reportedly sent a 24-hour takedown notice to Parler’s developers</a>, saying that it would mirror Google’s actions if the app didn’t immediately filter content that endangers safety. As of now, Parler remains available in the App Store, but if the timing is to be believed, the app could be taken down later this Saturday.</p>
<p>Given the complexities of content moderation, including the need to hire content moderators en masse, it seems highly unlikely that Parler could respond to these requests in any short period of time. What happens to the app and the president’s supporters long-term next is, right now, anyone’s guess.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s head over to the rest of the social networking world, where Trump is just as unpopular as he is at Facebook and Twitter HQ these days. Companies widely blocked the president from accessing their sites, and they also took action against affiliated groups.</p>
<p>Google-owned YouTube announced Thursday that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/youtube-election-strikes/">it would start handing out “strikes” against channels — including President Trump’s — that post election misinformation</a>. In the past, videos with election misinformation would have a warning label attached, but the channel itself didn’t face any consequences. In December, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/youtube-declares-war-on-us-election-misinformation-a-month-late/">the company changed that policy to include the outright removal of videos</a> purveying election misinformation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vcf7r6RYnL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/">Twitch disables Trump&#8217;s channel until the end of his term to &#8216;minimize harm&#8217; during transition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitch disables Trump&#8217;s channel until the end of his term to &#8216;minimize harm&#8217; during transition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/embed/#?secret=vcf7r6RYnL" data-secret="vcf7r6RYnL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This week’s latest policy change is an escalation from the company’s previous approach, and would result in lengthier and lengthier temporary suspensions for each additional strike that a channel receives. Those strikes could eventual result in a permanent ban for a YouTube channel if they happen within a set period of time. That’s precisely what happened with Steve Bannon’s channel, which was <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-bans-steve-bannons-war-room-podcast-channel/">permanently banned Friday late afternoon for repeated violations of YouTube’s policies</a>. Meanwhile, President Trump’s official channel has less than 3 million followers, and is currently still available for viewing on the platform.</p>
<p>Outside YouTube, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitch">Twitch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> followed a similar policy to Facebook, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/">announcing Thursday morning that it would ban the president “indefinitely”</a> and at least through the inauguration on January 20th. The president has a limited audience of just about 151,000 followers on the popular streaming platform, making it among the least important of the president’s social media accounts.</p>

<p>In terms of the president’s supporters, their groups are also being removed from popular tech platforms. On Friday, Reddit announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/reddit-donaldtrump-ban-capitol/">it would ban the subreddit r/DonaldTrump</a>, which had become one of a number of unofficial communities on the platform where the president’s most ardent supporters hung out. The social network had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/trump-suspended-from-twitch-as-reddit-bans-the-the_donald-and-additional-subreddits/">previously removed the controversial subreddit r/The_Donald back in June</a>. Discord on Friday <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221579/discord-bans-the-donald-server-reddit-subreddit?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">shut down a server related to that banned subreddit</a>, citing the server’s “overt connection to an online forum used to incite violence.”</p>
<p>Lastly, TikTok announced on Thursday that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/tiktok-bans-videos-of-trump-inciting-mob-blocks-stormthecapital-and-other-hashtags/">limiting the spread of some information related to the Capitol riots</a>, including redirecting hashtags and removing violent content as well as the president’s own video message to supporters. The president does not have a TikTok account, and therefore, most of the company’s actions are focused on his supporters and broader content surrounding the situation on Capitol Hill this week.</p>

<p>Now that Trump&#8217;s gone for good, we have a pretty interesting glimpse into the policy decision making that led Twitter to bring the hammer down on Friday. The company first announced Trump&#8217;s ban in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528">series of tweets from its @TwitterSafety account</a> but also <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">linked to a blog post detailing its thinking</a>.</p>
<p>In that deep dive, the company explains that it gave Trump one last chance <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">after suspending</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/is-trump-back-on-twitter/">and then reinstating</a> his account for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">violations made on Wednesday</a>. But the following day, a pair of tweets the president made pushed him over the line. Twitter said those tweets, pictured below, were not examined on a standalone basis, but rather in the context of his recent behavior and this week&#8217;s events.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; We have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service,&#8221; Twitter wrote.</p>

<p>This is how the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">explained its reasoning, point by point</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an &#8216;orderly transition&#8217; on January 20th.</li>
<li>&#8220;The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a &#8216;safe&#8217; target, as he will not be attending.</li>
<li>&#8220;The use of the words &#8216;American Patriots&#8217; to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.</li>
<li>&#8220;The mention of his supporters having a &#8216;GIANT VOICE long into the future&#8217; and that &#8216;They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!&#8217; is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an &#8216;orderly transition&#8217; and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election.</li>
<li>&#8220;Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All of that is pretty intuitive, though his most fervent supporters aren&#8217;t likely to agree. Ultimately these decisions, as much as they do come down to stated policies, involve a lot of subjective analysis and interpretation. Try as social media companies might to let algorithms make the hard calls for them, the buck stops with a group of humans trying to figure out the best course of action.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s explanation here offers a a rare totally transparent glimpse into how social networks decide what stays and what goes. It&#8217;s a big move for Twitter — one that many people reasonably believe should have been made months if not years ago — and it&#8217;s useful to have what is so often an inscrutable high-level decision making process laid out plainly and publicly for all to see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> took the major step Friday of permanently banning President Trump&#8217;s @realdonaldtrump Twitter account, the President aimed to get the last word in through his government account @POTUS which has a fraction of the Twitter followers but still offered the President a megaphone on the service to send out a few last tweets.</p>
<p>The tweets were deleted within minutes by Twitter which does not allow banned individuals to circumvent a full ban by tweeting under alternate accounts.</p>
<p>In screenshots captured by TechCrunch, Trump responds to the account ban by accusing Twitter employees of conspiring with his political opponents. &#8220;As I have been saying for a long time, Twitter has gone further and further in banning free speech, and tonight, Twitter employees have coordinated with the Democrats and Radical Left in removing my account from their platform, to silence me &#8212; and YOU, the 75,000,000 great patriots who voted for me.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2094188" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-6.17.34-PM.jpg?w=638" alt="" width="638" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-6.17.34-PM.jpg 2336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-6.17.34-PM.jpg?resize=141,150 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-6.17.34-PM.jpg?resize=282,300 282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-6.17.34-PM.jpg?resize=768,818 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-6.17.34-PM.jpg?resize=638,680 638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-6.17.34-PM.jpg?resize=1442,1536 1442w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-6.17.34-PM.jpg?resize=1923,2048 1923w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-6.17.34-PM.jpg?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p>The President&#8217;s rant further contends that he will soon be joining a new platform or starting his own. Many contended Trump would join right wing social media site <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> following the ban, though Friday afternoon the site was removed from the Google Play Store with the company saying Apple had threatened to suspend them as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been negotiating with various other sites, and will have a big announcement soon, while we also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future,&#8221; other tweets from the @POTUS account read in part.</p>
<p>The same messages were later tweeted from the President&#8217;s @Teamtrump campaign account, which Twitter subsequently suspended.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, A Twitter spokesperson wrote, &#8220;As we’ve said, using another account to try to evade a suspension is against our rules. We have taken steps to enforce this with regard to recent Tweets from the @POTUS account. For government accounts, such as @POTUS and @WhiteHouse, we will not suspend those accounts permanently but will take action to limit their use.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shortly after <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced Friday afternoon that they were permanently suspending the account of President Trump, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> shared that they were removing <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a conservative social media app, from their Play Store immediately, saying in a statement that they were suspending the app until the developers committed to a moderation and enforcement policy that could handle objectionable content on the platform.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.“</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Parler&#8217;s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parler.parler&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Play Store page</a> is currently down.</p>
<p>The conservative platform garnered attention this week after posts surfaced detailing threats of violence and planning around Tuesday&#8217;s chaotic Capitol building riots which led to the deaths of 5 people including a Capitol police officer. While more mainstream social media sites raced to take down violent content related to the riots, death threats and violence were easy to find across the Parler platform.</p>
<p>The app hosts accounts from a variety of conservative figures including many in the President&#8217;s family, though not the President himself.</p>

<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler">Buzzfeed News</a> reported that Parler had received a letter from Apple informing them that the app would be removed from the App Store within 24 hours unless the company submitted an update with a moderation improvement plan. Parler CEO John Matze confirmed the action from Apple in a post on his Parler account where he posted a screenshot of the notification from Apple.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be clear that Parler is in fact responsible for all the user generated content present on your service and for ensuring that this content meets App Store requirements for the safety and protection of our users,&#8221; text from the screenshot reads. &#8220;We won&#8217;t distribute apps that present dangerous and harmful content.</p>
<p>The app remains available in the App Store, though users are currently complaining of technical issues.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Apple for additional comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action,&#8221; Twitter wrote. &#8220;&#8230; We made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules and cannot use Twitter to incite violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump will not be able to get around Twitter&#8217;s ban by making a new account or using an alias, a Twitter spokesperson clarified to TechCrunch. If the president attempts to evade his suspension, any account he uses will also be subject to a ban for breaking Twitter&#8217;s rules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/president-trump-responds-to-twitter-account-ban-in-tweet-storm-from-potus-account/">Trump appeared to do just that Friday night</a>, popping up on @POTUS. &#8220;We will not be SILENCED! Twitter is not about FREE SPEECH,&#8221; Trump tweeted through that account, indicating that his team might build his own platform in the &#8220;near future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twitter emphasized that it made the threat of an impending ban clear and called this week&#8217;s events &#8220;horrific.&#8221; While Trump has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/twitter-trump-pennsylvania-tweet-mail-in-voting-supreme-court/">previously</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/23/twitter-hides-trump-tweet-behind-notice-for-potentially-dissuading-people-from-voting/">broken</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/coronavirus-protests-trump-liberate-minnesota-tweets-facebook-twitter/">the</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/twitter-trump-tweet-protester-threat-autonomous-zone/">platform&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/trump-flu-covid-misinformation-facebook-and-twitter/">rules</a>, the company&#8217;s maintained his account under its special guidance for world leaders and information in the public interest.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">in-depth breakdown</a>, Twitter published the assessments of Trump&#8217;s tweets that led to his suspension. Two of his tweets on Thursday appear to have pushed the account over the edge, and Twitter interpreted them as potentially inciting violence in the context of the week&#8217;s events.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Twitter suspended President Trump&#8217;s account until he deleted three tweets that the company flagged as violating its rules. Trump&#8217;s account was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">set to reactivate 12 hours after those deletions</a>, and he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/is-trump-back-on-twitter/">returned to the platform</a> on Thursday night with a video in which he appeared to concede his election loss for the first time.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">crossed a line with Twitter</a> when he failed to condemn a group of his supporters who staged a violent riot at the Capitol building while Congress met to certify the election results. In one tweet, Trump shared a video in which he gently encouraged the group to return home, while reassuring his agitated followers that he loved them and that they were &#8220;special.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that time, Twitter said that Trump&#8217;s tweets contained &#8220;repeated and severe violations&#8221; of its policy on civic integrity and threatened that any future violations would result in &#8220;permanent suspension&#8221; of the president&#8217;s account.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Friday, January 8:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>9:45 AM: Trump tweets again with a less conciliatory tone, declaring that anyone who voted for him will &#8220;not be treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!&#8221;</li>
<li>10:45 AM: Trump tweets that he will not attend President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s inauguration.</li>
<li>6:20 PM: Twitter announces that @realDonaldTrump is suspended permanently.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Facebook initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">took more drastic action against Trump&#8217;s account</a> in the aftermath of Wednesday&#8217;s chaotic siege on Capitol Hill, Twitter has a longer history of friction with the outgoing president. In early 2020, Twitter&#8217;s decision to add a contextual label to a Trump tweet calling mail-in voting &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; prompted the president to craft a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/">retaliatory though largely toothless executive order</a> targeting social media companies.</p>
<p>Trump held the same grudge through the end of the year, trying to push a doomed repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — the law that protects online companies from liability for user-generated content — through Congress in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">increasingly</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/section-230-stimulus-mcconnell-bill-trump/">unusual</a> ways.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s move Friday to suspend the sitting U.S. president from its platform is a historic decision — and one the company avoided making for the last four years. In the wake of Wednesday&#8217;s insurrectionist violence, and Trump&#8217;s role in inciting it, tech&#8217;s biggest social networks appear to have at last had enough.</p>
<p>But as with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/trump-tweet-steal-election-vote-by-mail/">election conspiracies</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/trump-flu-covid-misinformation-facebook-and-twitter/">dangerous COVID-19 misinformation</a> and the camo-clad extremists who attacked the Capitol this week, it&#8217;s too late to undo the chaos that real-time Trump unleashed over the last four years, 280 characters at a time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/envisics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="envisics">Envisics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder <span style="font-weight: 400;">and CEO Dr. Jamieson Christmas </span>launched the startup three years ago to &#8220;revolutionize&#8221; the in-car experience with its holographic technology. Now, it has a partner that could help it achieve that mission.</p>
<p>The U.K.-based holographic technology startup said Friday it reached an agreement with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/panasonic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="panasonic">Panasonic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Automotive Systems to jointly develop and commercialize a new generation of head-up displays for cars, trucks and SUVs. Panasonic Automotive Systems is a Tier 1 automotive supplier and a division of Panasonic Corporation of North America. The head-up displays are units integrated in the dash of a vehicle that project images onto the windshield to aid drivers with navigation and provide other alerts. The Panasonic HUDs, as they&#8217;re often called, will use Envisics holographic technology.</p>
<p>The deal, announced ahead of the virtual 2021 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tech trade show, follows Envisics&#8217; $50 million Series B funding round and news that its tech will be integrated in the upcoming <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cadillac" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cadillac">Cadillac <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Lyriq electric vehicle. The funding round, which brought Envisics a valuation of more than $250 million, included investments from <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyundai Mobis, GM Ventures, SAIC Ventures and Van Tuyl Companies.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Envisics&#8217; technology, the foundation of which came out of Christmas&#8217; PhD studies at Cambridge University more than 15 years ago, electronically manipulates the speed of light. This process enables images to appear three-dimensional, Christmas explained in a recent interview. The company has secured more than 250 patents and has another 160 pending certification.</p>
<p>The company is solely focused upon the automotive application of holography, Christmas said, adding that its first generation is already integrated in more than 150,000 Jaguar Land Rover vehicles.</p>
<p>Christmas said this new agreement aims to combine Panasonic&#8217;s expertise in optical design and its global reach as a Tier 1 supplier with Envisics&#8217; technology to bring holography into the mainstream. Mass production of vehicles using its technology is slated for 2023, according to the companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very much about part of our business plan, you know the Series B funding round we undertook was about scaling the business and enabling us to move forward as we enter the market,&#8221; Christmas said. &#8220;Part of that was a commitment to engage in partnerships with Tier ones that we can then work with to deliver these products to market.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first of those agreements,&#8221; he added, suggesting that Envisics has a much larger aim.</p>
<p>What that means, Christmas said, will be head-up displays with high resolution, wide color gamut and large images that can be overlaid upon reality. The technology can also project information at multiple distances simultaneously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That really unlocks very interesting applications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the short term, it will be kind of relatively simple augmented reality applications like navigation, highlighting the lane you&#8217;re supposed to be in and some safety applications. But as you look forward into things like autonomous driving it unlocks a whole realm of other opportunities like entertainment and video conferencing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that it could even be used for night vision applications such as overlaying enhanced information upon a dark road to make it clear where the road is going and what obstacles might be out there.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And today the CMA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">duly announced</a> it is investigating Mountain View&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">&#8220;Privacy Sandbox</a>.&#8221; Though, as yet, no conclusions have been reached on whether Google&#8217;s plan threatens competition.</span></p>

<p>In truth, a variety of business models support open access to information on the internet.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, for example &#8212; surely the canonical example of the open web &#8212; relies upon reader donations to keep the lights on as a not-for-profit.</p>
<p>While &#8212; on the &#8220;exclusive access&#8221; side &#8212; crowdfunding sites like Patreon and the subscription platform Substack offer tools for creators to solicit regular monetary subscriptions from fans and backers to unlock gated content.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s instructive to note how many online publishers have shifted, year over year, from free (ad-supported) access to content to selling subscriptions for (paywalled) content, often in addition to running ads.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s the Financial Times, the New York Times, the Telegraph or Business Insider, the list of pay-to-access news sites keeps getting longer. Much like the consent flows that (also) pop up asking to process visitors&#8217; information in order to target them with ads.</p>
<p>TechCrunch joined the ranks of subscription publications almost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/announcing-extra-crunch/">two years ago</a> when we launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/">Extra Crunch</a>. The main TC site continues to be free to access supported by ads and our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/announcing-techcrunchs-2021-event-calendar/">events business</a>. (NB: In 2021 our events are going <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/announcing-techcrunchs-2021-event-calendar/">fully virtual</a> &#8212; which means, as a brief, bonus aside, they&#8217;ve never been so open and accessible!)</p>
<p>So how come all these paywalls are being thrown up if advertising funds the open web, as MOW claims?</p>
<p>The concise answer is <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">that digital advertising pays publishers so poorly it can&#8217;t support producing quality content at the required scale on its own &#8212; thanks to myriad adtech intermediaries, click fraud and the big two: Google and Facebook; aka, the adtech duopoly, who take the lion&#8217;s share of revenue generated by digital advertising. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have found that intermediaries (the largest of which is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> capture at least 35% of the value of advertising bought from newspapers and other content providers in the U.K.,&#8221; the CMA reported last summer, in a major <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5fa557668fa8f5788db46efc/Final_report_Digital_ALT_TEXT.pdf">market study</a>.</p>
<p>Consumers turning to ad blockers to escape creepy ads and prevent privacy-hostile trackers from keeping real-time tabs on their digital activity and systematically passing this intel to scores of unknowns in an ad auction process that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">U.K.&#8217;s own data protection regulator has said isn&#8217;t very lawful</a>, is another relevant factor here.</p>
<p>Online advertising certainly funds something. But is that something the open web? That looks rather debatable at this point.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Don&#8217;t miss this epic Twitter fight between the IAB&#8217;s CEO and actual publishers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/dont-miss-this-epic-twitter-fight-between-the-iabs-ceo-and-actual-publishers/embed/#?secret=FQZ7JzHqv6" data-secret="FQZ7JzHqv6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I bring all this up merely to provide context for a chance detail in the MOW story that I want to share &#8212; as it illustrates some of the issues in this high stakes tug-of-war between publishers, digital marketing and adtech players and a handful of big (ad)tech versus the poor, frustrated eyeballs of the average internet user.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an important power struggle.</p>
<p>One which threatens to keep steamrollering internet users&#8217; right to protect their personal information from exploitation (and wider security-related risks) by, in the latest twist, co-opting competition regulators to erect barriers to pro-privacy reform. Assuming, that is, the CMA ends up naively swallowing dubious claims about what advertising does for the &#8220;open&#8221; internet &#8212; when evidence of what it <em>actually</em> does is but a click and a paywall/tortuously long consent to &#8220;share&#8221; your private data with hundreds of unknown firms away.</p>
<p>The regulator&#8217;s announcement today suggests it&#8217;s alive to the dysfunction surrounding internet users&#8217; privacy and will take more than a superficial look at that issue &#8212; though if the ICO is the main rep in the room batting for users&#8217; interests here that&#8217;s suboptimal, to say the least, given the latter&#8217;s storied <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">reluctance to enforce the actual law against adtech</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But here&#8217;s the tidbit &#8212; which comes by way of a PR agency working for MOW. Earlier today it CC&#8217;d me into an email thread in which several staf</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">fers had been discussing monitoring the CMA news on behalf of its client. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I&#8217;m not naming the agency or any of the individuals involved to spare their blushes but in the thread &#8212; which begins with &#8220;<em>FYI — The CMA are just about to announce a formal investigation into Google. We&#8217;ve drafted a comment which we will be circulating shortly&#8221;</em> &#8212; staff can be seen asking to share logins to a number of newspaper websites and/or start a free trial in order to access newspaper copy for free, i.e., without having to pay for new subscriptions. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do we have an FT login? If so, could you get hte [sic] story they&#8217;ve just written on MOW off for me?&#8221; asks one staffer.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward there&#8217;s a discussion about starting a free trial on the Telegraph&#8217;s website as they talk about collating relevant coverage into a single document to be able to monitor developments for MOW.</p>
<p>One staffer chips in to warn &#8220;you need to put credit card details in to start a trial&#8221; &#8212; before suggesting the other has a go &#8220;to see if you find a way around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This person follows up by saying they&#8217;ll &#8220;let you know if I manage to find a way around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, mmm, irony much?</p>

<p>In light of MOW&#8217;s advocacy for a &#8220;vibrant&#8221; ad-supported open web &#8212; which its website implies is aligned with the interests of publishers, marketers and adtech providers alike, i.e., not just with opaque adtech interests &#8212; it seems pretty relevant that an agency working for the industry group is uninterested, to put it politely, in paying for relevant newspaper content while being paid to lobby on adtech&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>On its website MOW argues that letting Google switch off third-party tracking cookies will be bad news for publishers because it says it will cut off marketers&#8217; ability to measure ad campaign performance across different sites &#8212; claiming that will result in less effective ads that yield a lower return and thus less cash remitted by marketers to publishers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BL2WIup2gg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/embed/#?secret=BL2WIup2gg" data-secret="BL2WIup2gg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study">CMA&#8217;s recent deep dive study of the digital marketing sector</a> found an industry so opaque and riddled with black box algorithms that the regulator listed &#8220;lack of transparency&#8221; itself as a competition concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Platforms with market power have the incentive and ability to increase prices, for example, or to overstate the quality and effectiveness of their advertising inventory,&#8221; it warned in the report. &#8220;They can take steps to reduce the degree of transparency in digital advertising markets, reducing other publishers’ ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of their advertising and forcing advertisers to rely on information and metrics provided by those platforms. And the lack of transparency undermines the ability of market participants to make the informed decisions necessary to drive competition. The upshot of all of these issues is that competition is weakened and trust in the market is eroded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that overarching assessment, who would take an opaque coalition of marketers&#8217; word for it that current-gen cookie tracking of the entire internet yields irreplaceably valuable performance metrics?</p>
<p>Or that such privacy-hostile tracking is the only viable way to support a &#8220;vibrant open web&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;The lack of transparency is particularly severe in the open display market where publishers and advertisers rely on intermediaries to manage the process of real-time bidding and ad serving but cannot observe directly what the intermediaries are doing or, in some cases, how much they are being charged,&#8221; the CMA goes on, sharpening its concerns about the extent of the obfuscation that cloaks the practices of adtech middlemen. &#8220;Market participants such as newspapers and advertisers typically do not have visibility of the fees charged along the entire supply chain and this limits their ability to make optimal choices on how to buy or to sell inventory, reducing competition among intermediaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing is clear: The adtech industry needs a whole lot of disinfecting sunlight to be shone in. And that clarification process will surely demand substantial reform.</p>
<p>Refusing to change how things are done by claiming there&#8217;s simply no other way to preserve the web &#8220;as we know it&#8221; is as ridiculous an idea as it is anti-innovation in sentiment.</p>
<p>Returning to the misfired email thread, we contacted MOW&#8217;s PR agency to ask whether or not the account includes expenses for relevant newspaper subscriptions. It told us these would come out of a central agency fund. Additionally &#8212; having checked back on it &#8212; the agency said it did in fact have subscriptions to the newspaper sites in question.</p>
<p>The spokesperson explained that the staffers involved just hadn&#8217;t realized at the time &#8212; in the heat of the &#8220;day-to-day PR&#8221; moment (and whilst wrangling remote-working-impacted comms). And, presumably, as all those subscription login screens threw up barriers to accessing the content they needed in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>This (senior) spokesperson blamed themselves for what they described as a &#8220;cock up&#8221; &#8212; including the soliciting of a &#8220;paywall workaround&#8221; &#8212; going on to take full <em>mea culpa</em> responsibility and emphasizing it had nothing to do with MOW or with the MOW account.</p>
<p>But, well, if an agency working for an adtech lobby group whose key claim is that &#8220;<em>ads support the open internet&#8221;</em> is unable to access the online content they need to do their job without a subscription, what does that tell us about how much of an open internet the advertising industry is <em>actually</em> funding right now?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This has been quite a week.</p>
<p>Instead of walking backward through the last few days of chaos and uncertainty, here are three good things that happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google employee Sara Robinson combined her interest in machine learning and baking to create <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/google-ai-concocts-breakie-and-cakie-hybrid-baked-goods/">AI-generated hybrid treats.</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/desalination-breakthrough-maximizes-flow-for-cheaper-water-filtration/">breakthrough</a> could make water desalination 30%-40% more effective.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/30669196/boston-red-sox-bianca-smith-says-aspires-mlb-manager">Bianca Smith</a> will become the first Black woman to coach a professional baseball team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite many distractions in our first full week of the new year, we published a full slate of stories exploring different aspects of entrepreneurship, fundraising and investing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve already gotten feedback on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/how-to-convert-customers-with-subscription-pricing/">this overview of subscription pricing models</a>, and a look back at 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/2020-was-a-record-year-for-israels-security-startup-ecosystem/">funding rounds and exits among Israel&#8217;s security startups</a> was aimed at our new members who live and work there, along with international investors who are seeking new opportunities.</p>
<p>Plus, don&#8217;t miss our first investor surveys of 2021: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/8-investors-discuss-social-gamings-biggest-opportunities/">one by Lucas Matney on social gaming</a>, and another by Mike Butcher that gathered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/lisbons-startup-scene-rises-as-portugal-gears-up-to-be-a-european-tech-tiger/">responses from Portugal-based investors</a> on a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>In February 2020, gaming platform <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roblox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roblox">Roblox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was valued at $4 billion, but after announcing a $520 million Series H this week, it&#8217;s now worth $29.5 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, you could argue that Roblox enjoyed an epic 2020, thanks in part to COVID-19,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm this morning. &#8220;That helped its valuation. But there’s a lot of space between $4 billion and $29.5 billion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex suggests that Roblox&#8217;s decision to delay its IPO and raise an enormous Series H was a grandmaster move that could influence how other unicorns will take themselves to market. &#8220;A big thanks to the gaming company for running this experiment for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him what inspired the headline; like most good ideas, it came to him while he was trying to get to sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that I had &#8216;The Queen&#8217;s Gambit&#8217; somewhere in my head, so that formed the root of a little joke with myself. Roblox is making a strategic wager on method of going public. So, &#8216;gambit&#8217; seems to fit!&#8221;</p>

<p>For our first investor survey of the year, Lucas Matney interviewed eight VCs who invest in massively multiplayer online games to discuss 2021 trends and opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hope Cochran, Madrona Venture Group</li>
<li>Daniel Li, Madrona Venture Group</li>
<li>Niko Bonatsos, General Catalyst</li>
<li>Ethan Kurzweil, Bessemer Venture Partners</li>
<li>Sakib Dadi, Bessemer Venture Partners</li>
<li>Jacob Mullins, Shasta Ventures</li>
<li>Alice Lloyd George, Rogue</li>
<li>Gigi Levy-Weiss, NFX</li>
</ul>
<p>Having moved far beyond shooters and sims, platforms like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitch">Twitch, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Discord and Fortnite are &#8220;where culture is created,&#8221; said Daniel Li of Madrona.</p>
<p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez uses Twitch to explain policy positions, major musicians regularly perform in-game concerts on Fortnite and in-game purchases generated tens of billions last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gaming is a unique combination of science and art, left and right brain,&#8221; said Gigi Levy-Weiss of NFX. &#8220;It’s never just science (i.e., software and data), which is why many investors find it hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Startups that lack insight into their sales funnel have high churn, low conversion rates and an inability to adapt or leverage changes in customer behavior.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re hoping to convert and retain customers, &#8220;reinforcing your value proposition should play a big part in every level of your customer funnel,&#8221; says Joe Procopio, founder of Teaching Startup.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm followed up his regular Friday column with another story that tries to find a well-grounded rationale for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sky-high valuation of approximately $822 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GM just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/gm-launches-new-logo-to-show-its-serious-about-its-electric-future/">unveiled a new logo and tagline</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, I learned something new while editing: A &#8220;melt up&#8221; occurs when investors start clamoring for a particular company because of acute FOMO (the fear of missing out).</p>
<p>Delivering 500,000 cars in 2020 was &#8220;impressive,&#8221; says Alex, who also acknowledged the company&#8217;s ability to turn GAAP profits, but &#8220;pride cometh before the fall, as does a melt up, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note: This story has Alex&#8217;s original headline, but I told him I would replace the featured image with a photo of someone who had very &#8220;richest man in the world&#8221; face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Its purpose was to move data through Segment’s data pipes to wherever customers needed it quickly and efficiently at the lowest operating cost,&#8221; but as Ron reports, it was also meant to solve &#8220;an existential crisis for the young business,&#8221; which needed a more resilient platform.</p>

<p>How do you scale online tutoring, particularly when demand exceeds the supply of human instructors?</p>
<p>This month, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chegg" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chegg">Chegg <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is replacing its seven-year-old marketplace that paired students with tutors with a live chatbot.</p>
<p>A spokesperson said the move will “dramatically differentiate our offerings from our competitors and better service students,&#8221; but Natasha Mascarenhas identified two challenges to edtech automation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A chatbot won’t work for a student with special needs or someone who needs to be handheld a bit more,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Second, speed tutoring can only work for a specific set of subjects.&#8221;</p>

<p>While I watched insurrectionists invade and vandalize the U.S. Capitol on live TV, I noticed that staffers evacuated so quickly, some hadn&#8217;t had time to shut down their computers.</p>
<p>Looters even made off with a laptop from Senator Jeff Merkley&#8217;s office, but according to security reporter Zack Whittaker, the damages to infosec wasn&#8217;t as bad as it looked.</p>
<p>Even so, &#8220;the breach will likely present a major task for Congress’ IT departments, which will have to figure out what’s been stolen and what security risks could still pose a threat to the Capitol’s network.&#8221;</p>

<p>On New Year&#8217;s Eve, I made a list of the 10 &#8220;best&#8221; Extra Crunch stories from the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>My methodology was personal: From hundreds of posts, these were the 10 I found most useful, which is my key metric for business journalism.</p>
<p>Some readers are skeptical about paywalls, but without being boastful, Extra Crunch is a premium product, just like Netflix or Disney+. I know, we’re not as entertaining as a historical drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II or a space western about a bounty hunter. But, speaking as someone who’s worked at several startups, Extra Crunch stories contain actionable information you can use to build a company and/or look smart in meetings — and that’s worth something.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> took action against a pair of President Trump&#8217;s close associates Friday, banning them from the platform as part of a broader effort to contain the QAnon conspiracy movement.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s first national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell were <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/twitter-bans-michael-flynn-sidney-powell-qanon-account-purge-n1253550">both suspended</a> under Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;coordinated harmful activity&#8221; policy. Ron Watkins, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93wqm7/ron-watkins-meet-the-dangerous-qanon-figure-doing-whatever-it-takes-to-win-trumps-approval">who previously ran 8kun</a> (formerly 8chan) also saw his account removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm, and given the renewed potential for violence surrounding this type of behavior in the coming days, we will permanently suspend accounts that are solely dedicated to sharing QAnon content,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In recent months, each figure has promoted QAnon, an elaborate constellation of conspiracy theories purporting that President Trump is waging a secret battle against a cabal of political enemies who engage in child sex trafficking, among other baseless claims.</p>
<p>As part of Trump&#8217;s post-election legal team, Powell became a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/24/business/sidney-powell-qanon/index.html">heroic figure to the QAnon crowd</a>, which believes that a master plan being orchestrated behind the scenes will give the president a second term. Powell also amplified the Dominion voting machine conspiracy, which claims devices from that company switched votes from Trump to Biden. Dominion Voting Systems is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/954836971/dominion-voting-sues-former-trump-lawyer-seeking-1-3-billion-in-damages">suing Powell for $1.3 billion over the false claims</a>, arguing that her &#8220;viral disinformation campaign&#8221; has damaged its business.</p>
<p>Flynn embraced the QAnon movement last year, reciting an oath and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/politics/michael-flynn-qanon-video/index.html">saying the popular QAnon motto &#8220;where we go one, we go all!&#8221;</a> Flynn has also been actively involved in Trump&#8217;s quest to overturn the results of the November election. In what was then a shocking scandal, Flynn <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/01/politics/michael-flynn-charged/index.html">pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI in 2017</a>. Last year, the Justice Department dropped the federal case against Flynn and Trump eventually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/us/politics/michael-flynn-pardon.html">issued his former adviser a pardon</a>.</p>
<p>Of the three, Watkins is the furthest from Trump and the closest to the heart of QAnon. As the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93wqm7/ron-watkins-meet-the-dangerous-qanon-figure-doing-whatever-it-takes-to-win-trumps-approval">administrator of QAnon&#8217;s central online hub</a>, Watkins played a key role QAnon&#8217;s explosion into the mainstream over the last few years. Beyond the ranks of believers, some QAnon observers believe that Ron Watkins or his father Jim Watkins are the mysterious &#8220;Q&#8221; figure, perpetuating the elaborate scheme by doling out cryptic bread crumbs for QAnon adherents.</p>
<p>Twitter first began<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/twitter-qanon-ban/"> restricting QAnon content in mid-2020</a>, citing similar concerns over real-world harm. The new enforcement plan goes much further, and Twitter&#8217;s new commitment to permanently suspending any QAnon stands to have a much bigger impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.venrock.com/">Venrock</a>, the 51-year-old firm that started as the venture arm of the Rockefeller family, has closed its ninth fund with $450 million, the same amount it raised for its last two funds. The outfit, with offices in Palo Alto, New York and Cambridge, clearly feels comfortable with the fund size, but it says change is otherwise a constant, given that trends and tech shift so fast that so-called pattern recognition can prove a liability if an investment team isn&#8217;t careful.</p>
<p>To learn more about what the team is tracking at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/venrock" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="venrock">Venrock <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; whose newest exits include last year&#8217;s IPOs of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/13/cloudflare-cofounder-michelle-zatlyn-on-the-companys-successful-ipo-and-whats-next/">Cloudflare</a> and <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/10x-genomics-ipo-rockets-past-a-390m-raise">10x Genomics</a> IPO, and the recent sales of<a href="https://corvidiatx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NN_to_acquire_Corvidia.pdf"> Corvidia</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2020/06/29/robo-advisor-personal-capital-to-be-acquired-for-up-to-1-billion">Personal Capital</a> &#8212; we were in touch earlier today with longtime partner Bryan Roberts, who has spent his 24-year career in venture with the firm.</p>
<p>Our exchange has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: I talked with your colleague Camille Samuels <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/veteran-healthcare-vc-camille-samuels-explains-why-trying-to-cure-infectious-disease-is-a-lousy-business/">earlier this year</a> about aging biology. How big an area of focus is that for Venrock and why?</strong></p>
<p>BR: It&#8217;s one of many interesting areas of biology on a go-forward basis, along with immunology, CNS (central nervous system) and other areas where there has been little progress and great unmet need.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Speaking of unmet needs, Camille also talked about why infectious disease isn&#8217;t good business for new companies, as are cancers and orphan diseases. As she explained it, with something like the coronavirus, it&#8217;s hard to get funding before it&#8217;s an actual problem; once a treatment is developed, it has to be sold at low cost, and then you hope you won&#8217;t have repeat customers. Do you agree, and do you think this needs to change?</strong></p>
<p>BR: Yes, I think things need to change, but there are several issues. In the case of one company on which I lost a bunch of money &#8212; Achaogen, which made a successful drug for a big unmet need [but faced] <a href="https://endpts.com/once-picked-as-a-500m-winner-bankrupt-achaogen-auctions-off-its-antibiotic-for-a-fraction-of-that/">screwy commercialization dynamics</a> in the infectious disease space &#8212; and for many historical infectious disease companies, the cost of a drug is borne by the hospital, not billed separately.</p>

<p>It has also been hard historically to get anyone to pay attention to much of anything from a preventive perspective &#8212; even more so in communicable diseases. COVID was, on the one hand, not a particularly hard biological problem to solve, but from an investing perspective, the issue was it was a problem tailor-made for an existent or large company to tackle, not a startup. Startups take 12 or more months to find their way out the front door, and the problem is largely solved by then by one of the very large competitors.</p>
<p>You saw this with Moderna. Its tech turned out to be specifically suited to vaccines &#8212; and then a pandemic hit.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Venrock recently helped incubate a new microbiome startup called <a href="https://www.federation.bio/">Federation Bio</a>, which is the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/federation-bio-launches-50m-to-pursue-microbial-treatments">first bet on the space</a>. Why not move faster into this area, and how would you describe the size of the opportunity now? Is this something you want to delve into more aggressively?</strong></p>
<p>BR: We did spend 12 months or so helping get Federation started, including my partner Racquel Bracken acting as the initial CEO. We weren&#8217;t compelled by the prior approaches and teams, and it is really the intersection of those two dynamics that get us involved in new projects.</p>
<p>In this case, a terrific academic, Michael Fischbach, had generated great data, so we ran with it. We recently spent more than 12 months incubating a new gene therapy startup in the same manner &#8212; in the latter case, a couple of great academics generated exquisite cell type specificity &#8212; so we went out and found some leadership and just seeded the business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It&#8217;s one way to avoid crazy valuations. Where have valuations gone up the most?</strong></p>
<p>BR: Everywhere, but especially for companies that appear &#8212; or actually have &#8212; reduced binary risk and become growth-stage businesses [and that&#8217;s] across sectors.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You focus on so much: biotechnology, diagnostics, genomics, healthcare IT, medical devices. What are some of biggest trends you&#8217;re watching in some of these areas, and where do you think you might be spending a little more of your time in 2021?</strong></p>
<p>BR: Personally, I am compelled these days by first, value-based care in healthcare delivery &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s more efficient, there are better outcomes, there&#8217;s better customer experience &#8212; and mostly from full-stack platforms versus point solutions. I&#8217;m also focused on biological insights and applications that new genomics tools &#8212; single cell; gene editing &#8212; can bring. Last, [I&#8217;m tracking what] novel therapeutic modalities can bring to really bad diseases. It feels like we&#8217;re in the first inning of cell and gene therapy.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you think the new administration in Washington could impact your work?</strong></p>
<p>BR: I think there will be lots of talk about material changes to healthcare and other stuff, but I think it will mostly be talk given the slim margin in the Senate, as well as the decreased and small margin [that Democrats have] in the House. I think it will be a positive in that a bunch of the silly stuff around the [Affordable Care Act] will fade to nothing and people can get on with trying to improve implementation and go build.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you make of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-amazon-jpmorgan-berkshire-venture-collapsed-health-care-was-too-big-a-problem-11610039485">recent collapse</a> of Haven, the joint venture of Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to reduce the healthcare costs of their own employees? Would you like to see Amazon focused more &#8212; or less &#8212; on healthcare?</strong></p>
<p>BR: We&#8217;ve long been bears [about its odds] for a bunch of the reasons folks cited over the last few weeks [including lack of transparency into healthcare costs].</p>

<p>I would love to see Amazon use its brand, delivery logistics excellence and ability to compete at super-tight margins in healthcare. I don’t think it extends to real regulatory, privacy or risk appetite, but the company could be an awesome pharmacy/pharmacy benefit manager &#8212; and I hope they do it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Regarding Venrock&#8217;s new fund, have there been personnel changes? Will check sizes change? </strong></p>
<p>BR: We made Racquel Bracken and Ethan Batraski partners; it&#8217;s always fun when you can promote terrific young talent from within.</p>
<p>As for our high-level strategy, check sizes and stages all remain the same. We&#8217;ve raised $450 million for each of the last several funds because we like that size and our culture and personality is way more focused on performance than on asset accumulation. It also feels really hard to raise increasing amounts of capital without affecting performance excellence.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Healthcare has never been hotter. How much of Venrock&#8217;s capital is focused on healthcare, and will that change with this newest fund?</strong></p>
<p>BR: We&#8217;re pretty bottoms-up allocation driven; we invest based on the projects we find and fall in love with. Life sciences usually ends up being around 30% to 40% [of capital invested]. Healthcare IT, which depending who you talk to in the universe gets lumped into healthcare or tech &#8212; I confess those software-enabled services businesses feel much more tech-like than biotech &#8212; usually ends up being about a quarter of the fund and there are no anticipated changes. The balance will go into tech &#8212; primarily tech and data-enabled software and services businesses.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Has Venrock considered forming a blank-check company to take a company public, as more VCs are doing?</strong></p>
<p>BR: We have not. I feel like most investors that have formed SPACs have done so more because of the compelling sponsor economics than a compelling, durable mechanism to get awesome companies public in a much more efficient manner than they otherwise might. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the economics change as the supply and demand of SPACs versus &#8220;great targets&#8221; changes and the SPACs get closer to the end of their hunting-license period.</p>
