										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A typical enterprise grapples with hundreds or thousands of agreements, contracts and other legal documents every year, and it usually engages costly legal counsel either inside or outside the company to assess those documents on their behalf. Now, a startup called <a href="https://www.incloudcounsel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InCloudCounsel</a> that is part RPA and part BPO &#8212; it has built tools to both automate and, in some cases, outsource this work &#8212; is announcing a Series B round of $200 million, money that it will be using to meet demand for its services.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the startup is rebranding to <a href="https://www.ontra.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ontra</a> &#8212; signifying &#8220;getting to the heart of contracts&#8221;, according to the startup&#8217;s CEO and founder Troy Pospisil.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Blackstone Growth (the growth equity business of the investment giant), with previous backer Battery Ventures and board member Mike Paulus (who previously ran and sold Assurance IQ to Prudential, and before that was an investor with Andreessen Horowitz). Valuation is not being disclosed, but prior to this, in July 2019, the company had raised $40 million in a round led by Battery &#8212; a sum that had previously been undisclosed until today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is not talking about its valuation, but as a marker of what kinds of companies Ontra is targeting and working with, Blackstone is a strategic and financial investor in this round: Blackstone MD Paul Morrissey tells me that the firm is a strong user of Ontra&#8217;s tech to filter through thousands of NDAs and other contracts that it issues and receives every year, where the technology uses AI techniques like NLP to essentially guard Blackstone&#8217;s interests, scanning documents for items that are unusual or might need modifying ahead of being signed, and then passing on those documents to human lawyers for final checks. In all, Ontra is processing some 20,000 NDAs monthly at the moment.</p>
<p>Pospisil said first came up with the idea for Ontra when he was working as an investment specialist at HIG Capital, where he saw how the need to triage large volumes of contracts would slow down deals and other important transactions that the company was making. HIG would have a large legal counsel on board to handle work, but even so it needed to rely on outside organizations also to complement and supplement that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even simple contracts needed to be recorded and catalogued,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;We would send these to a law firm, or we might staff up a team, but no one was using any technology to track what they were doing. There was no visibility into what is where, whether data is lost in the process.&#8221; This covered long, complex agreements; important contracts and credit agreements, he said. &#8220;All these were incredibly complicated.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was 2014, and he was living in San Francisco and seeing a lot of interesting business models such as Uber&#8217;s emerging that gave him an idea to, in his words, &#8220;combine tech and a labor model to solve the problem.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ontra&#8217;s approach thus encompasses two parts. First, tapping into innovations were happening in the wider world of document management processing, it uses natural language and other algorithmic techniques to speed up the processing of large amounts of documentation faster and more efficiently than a human might do it. You might think of this as akin to a kind of very specialized version of robotic process automation.</p>
<p>That document processing work, in turn, is then handed over to the second part of the Ontra platform, its crowdsourced network of lawyers. Essentially, following the Uber and others&#8217; model of bringing in gig workers to handle jobs on demand, Ontra has amassed a team of legal professionals &#8212; typically corporate lawyers &#8212; who either provide some hours to Ontra in a side-gig if they are not already working full time, or in some cases as a small way to earn money using their skill at a time when may be doing something else (or, not working at all). Pospisil said that in cases where a company might have their own in-house teams, they might also use Ontra just for the processing side to speed work up, but as a general rule, customers are taking the full package.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is like payroll,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You don’t want to be doing it internally if it&#8217;s not strategically important to what you want to be doing as a business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ontra interestingly has not yet come up against legal firms that might see it as competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were a little worried that we would be considered competition to the law firms, but they really like us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don’t want to be doing this work, either. They are focusing on larger M&amp;A transactions and supporting the company. The world has this weird idea that legal work always needs to be sent to a law firm, but it&#8217;s not always efficient to do that, and lawyers are too expensive to do that. It&#8217;s not right-sized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morrissey at Blackstone believes that the future lies in continuing to pursue the two sides of the business model, with the lawyer network an important complement to what is at heart a tech company, with more software being added all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to underestimate the tech they have built,&#8221; he said, which is partly there in aid of making its network of lawyers much more efficient. &#8220;It means Ontra is also improving the workflow for them, with analytics that essentially say ‘focus on this’ and not other things in a contract.&#8221; The company also offers a full invoicing platform for the legal market, he said, &#8220;similar to the piece Uber has built for consumers so that drivers get paid and don’t have to worry about anything else.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company plans to have ingredients ready by next year, which means we could see the first commercial products containing Shiru’s ingredients on grocery store shelves as early as 2023.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Protein biochemist Dr. Jasmin Hume was working in the alternative food space when she saw an opportunity to evolve technology so that our global food industry can reduce its reliance on animals.</p>
<p>She started <a href="https://www.shiru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiru</a> in 2019, and the company uses a “precision fermentation” process to create plant-based ingredients for food companies. The result has similar taste, texture, versatility and cost at scale as its animal analogs, Hume told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“The opportunity that I saw and learned about is that the ingredients that we get from animals, the egg proteins or dairy proteins, pop up in food labels in weird places,” she added. “For example, white, spongy bread has milk proteins. We aim to cover a lot of food categories, but by replacing them with sustainable and nutritious ingredients.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Both the food ingredients and plant-based proteins markets are poised for steady growth. The <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/627706/market-size-of-food-ingredients-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global food ingredients market</a> is forecasted to be valued at $400 billion by 2022, while <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/plant-based-foods-market-to-hit-162-billion-in-next-decade-projects-bloomberg-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plant-based foods</a> are in line to be a $162 billion market by 2030.</p>

<p>Shiru’s catalog currently has six different ingredients that are colorless and flavorless and can be added to a variety of food products, like packaged baked goods, sauces, burgers and yogurt.</p>
<p>One of the food targets Hume and her team are looking to replace is methyl cellulose, a starch that is used in foods like vegetable protein-based foods.</p>
<p>“It provides a binding function that isn’t already in plant-based burgers and sauces, however, it is a nasty ingredient to have on the label,” Hume added. “Food companies have issues with methyl cellulose, but no one is talking about it. That type of ingredient compels a replacement, and we have the ingredients to replace that.”</p>
<p>To get out ahead of the industry demand and be able to deliver these first ingredients to companies by early next year, the Emeryville-based company today announced a $17 million Series A round, led by S2G Ventures.</p>
<p>Joining S2G on the round are returning investors Lux Capital, CPT Capital, Y Combinator and Emles Venture Partners, and new investors, The W Fund, SALT and Veronorte. The new funding brings Shiru’s total funding to date to just over $20 million, Hume said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the investment, Chuck Templeton, managing director of S2G, joined Shiru’s board. The firm is an investment fund focused on healthy food and sustainable agriculture, and often invests in companies that have impact and an analog to replace animal products.</p>
<p>There has been an evolution of plant-based foods, with each new version aimed at being better tasting, though still not as healthy as could be, he said. Shiru’s ingredients, on the other hand, are poised to be a new version that not only &#8220;tastes great,&#8221; but closely mirrors the analog it is trying to replace and is healthier, he added.</p>
<p>In addition, Templeton believes the company has figured out the cost structure, nutritional panels and the right labeling to “get customers excited.”</p>
<p>“They are just now discovering products and proteins faster and are able to look at how to bring ingredients to market that have multiple uses,” he added. “This gives them an opportunity to fine tune and continue to do things like bring the cost structure down. Jasmin and her team are enabling the food industry to not be constrained and to find the best ingredients to clean up their labels and the environment.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Startups making meat alternatives are gaining traction worldwide&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/startups-making-meat-alternatives-are-gaining-traction-worldwide/embed/#?secret=QsGEUxXS1v" data-secret="QsGEUxXS1v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, with the plan to have ingredients ready for customers by next year, Hume forecasts that we could see the first commercial products containing Shiru’s ingredients on grocery store shelves as early as 2023.</p>
<p>The company was initially heads down working on the technology, and when it was validated, Hume began looking at another round of venture capital to continue to the next phase of scaling and build out Shiru’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>She intends to use the new funding to double Shiru’s 22-person workforce within the next 12 months in the areas of science, fermentation, marketing and business development. The company is also moving into a new headquarters in Alameda next year and will begin scaling its manufacturing.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing we need to do is produce a lot of ingredients,” Hume added. “The scaling challenge is going to be a big one, and we are seeking partnerships or building the facilities ourselves to use the fermentation at industrial scales. This will get us to the point where we can deliver the samples that food companies need for testing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year European startup <a href="https://sundayapp.com/">Sunday</a>raised $100 million in a Series A raise led by US investors Coatue and DST Global, just five months after launching. The proposition was relatively simple and pretty much tailor-made for the Covid-19 era: diners scan a QR code to download an app, and then split the bill between friends as well as tip the staff, without needing to interact with wait staff. The proposition is that restaurants get to turn tables around faster, increase average spend, and wait staff generally get more tips.</p>
<p>Now a UK startup is entering the space, this time with a LOT less funding, but what appears to be an even more seamless user experience.</p>
<p>The ‘<a href="https://tableyeti.com/">Tap to Tip</a>’ device comes with pre-loaded software connected to the restaurant. The whole bill is paid by all diners via this device, just by them tapping it. It then captures data for the restaurant, and generates tips for the staff.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224808" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup behind the device, <a href="http://www.yetico.co">YETiCo</a>, has now raised a £300,000 Seed funding round, backed by Angels including DesignMyNight founder Nick Telson, Skimlinks co-founder Alicia Navarro, Masabi founder Ben Whitaker, Simon Squibb, Dot Major of the band London Grammar and Lego CTO Atul Bhardwaj.</p>
<p>Launched in 2019, YETiCo offers restaurants a bill splitting, pay-at-table restaurant device. The startup claims it’s driven £10m in transaction volume in its first year, with restaurant clients such as Maray Restaurants, Jones Family Kitchen, Wuns Tearoom and Cub.</p>
<p>The Tap to Tip TableYeti device now has an exclusive distribution deal with TiPJAR and is now available in over 300 bars and restaurants across the UK.   </p>
<p>Founder Oliver Pugh said: “We really bet on hospitality being about experience versus becoming an extension of Deliveroo just in a restaurant post COVID. That bet is now looking correct, as TableYeti alone has a run rate of £1m ARR with global brand name restaurants.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[The new funding represents a “hyper growth moment” for the company, which is in position to bring in some $300 million in revenue this year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After developing a network of telehealth, diagnostics and pharmacies for consumers, digital health company <a href="http://truepill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truepill</a> is targeting healthcare incumbents like health payers, providers and employer groups.</p>
<p>The new focus is buoyed by the close of its $142 million Series D funding round, led by an undisclosed partner, with participation from existing investors Initialized Capital and TI Platform Management.</p>
<p>The latest investment nearly doubles the San Mateo-based company’s venture capital funding raised since its inception five years ago to $256 million — which includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/closing-on-75-million-in-new-cash-truepill-plans-at-home-testing-service-as-it-nears-175-million-in-annual-revenue/">$75 million Series C</a> round last August — and pushes Truepill into unicorn territory with a valuation of $1.6 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224262" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since its Series C, Truepill has been busy: it debuted its telehealth and diagnostic services, and launched its COVID-19 wellness program and virtual pharmacy e-commerce offerings. To date, it has shipped nearly 10 million prescriptions, processed approximately 1 million diagnostic tests and facilitated more than 50,000 telehealth visits per week.</p>

<p>“We were just launching our diagnostics and telehealth in August, and now we are building on that,” Umar Afridi, CEO and co-founder of Truepill, told TechCrunch. “We are now expanding who we work with. Initially it was direct-to-consumer, but now we want to work with larger entities, including health plans, payers, life science companies and providers.”</p>
<p>The company’s “big focus is continuing the vision of transforming healthcare,” said Sid Viswanathan, president and co-founder of Truepill. Going after the healthcare incumbents is a signal that the company is prepared to service the whole industry, but it may take a few years for some of these partnerships to actualize, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to extending its customer base, the founders say the new funding represents a “hyper growth moment” for the company, which is in position to bring in some $300 million in revenue this year, Viswanathan said.</p>
<p>It will enable Truepill to add hundreds of new positions across its organization, including engineering, business development and pharmacy as it opens six new pharmacy and over-the-counter fulfillment facilities in California, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania by next year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Telemedicine startups are positioning themselves for a post-pandemic world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/telemedicine-startups-are-positioning-themselves-for-a-post-pandemic-world/embed/#?secret=FgJagXTdg3" data-secret="FgJagXTdg3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With regard to the company’s new valuation, Viswanathan explained that the company hasn’t been one to chase the unicorn milestone, but did say reaching the $1.6 billion valuation is “reflective of our ambition.” It also has a pipeline of new projects on the horizon.</p>
<p>“We still have a lot in store for 2022,” he added. “It is still early but if we start to show what we can do, we will be helping 330 million people in the U.S. that deal with healthcare, and we know where we want to see the change take place.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Garry Tan, founder and managing partner at Initialized Capital, says Truepill now has the reach and scale that it can work across the whole spectrum of healthcare, similar to what Stripe is doing in fintech.</p>
<p>He noted that he “was impressed” by how the company went from a core pharmacy service in 2016 to providing software now for telehealth and diagnostics, calling it “unusual” in healthcare to be able to find success in multiple areas.</p>
<p>In addition, Tan believes that what Truepill is doing in the direct-to-consumer market is giving people choices. They can continue to work with their primary care provider, but for different types of treatment, could tap into remote patient monitoring or another level of care through Truepill.</p>
<p>“We often worry about access, but Truepill is in an interesting spot,” he added. “We talk in technology that you are either arming the ‘rebels’ or the ‘empire,’ and in their case, they work with both. They are helping incumbents roll out a 50,000-person telehealth visit program, and on the flip side, enabling new startups, who can do this themselves, to be able to save time and money.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five-year-old startup <a href="https://skyryse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyryse</a> has raised a $200 million Series B to develop FlightOS, a flight automation technology stack that the company says will help experienced pilots operate new types of aircraft and allow complete novices to quickly learn the ropes of flying.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the company says FlightOS will be able to be retrofitted onto any aircraft &#8212; potentially unlocking flight controls to anyone that can operate a touchscreen and a joystick. Right now, that touchscreen is an iPad, but Skyryse told TechCrunch that will be replaced by “aviation certified touchscreens” in the finished product.</p>
<p>In addition to the screen and joystick, the FlightOS stack includes actuators and flight control computers, which would replace an aircraft’s existing mechanical systems. This one-to-one replacement means that the entire system is “cost neutral,” allowing OEMs to manufacture a vehicle with FlightOS at the same cost as they would for existing aircraft, the company said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224558" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In its early years, Skyryse pursued a fully automated system, with the intention of launching its own urban air mobility service. But the company has scaled back from being an operator, and is instead moving full-force on the FlightOS stack.</p>
<p>FlightOS is not full automation; there still must be someone to operate the joystick, after all. But it’s close. Right now, CEO Mark Groden said the near-term goal was to boost the skills of certified pilots, but longer-term his plans are much more ambitious.</p>
<p>“Our near-term goal is to improve safety in aviation, give current pilots the confidence to fly in various weather conditions with their families and open up new types of aircraft to them,” Groden told TechCrunch. “Our long-term goal is to allow the 220 million licensed drivers to operate any aircraft safely and effectively.”</p>
<p>Still, the system does not account for things like communicating with air traffic control or an understanding of which conditions are unsafe to fly in &#8212; things that a certified pilot might learn. But Groden said the current certification process on its own does not ensure safe pilots, the same way getting a driver’s license to operate a vehicle does not ensure attentive driving.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2224602" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224602" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2224602" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RF1_4084.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RF1_4084.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RF1_4084.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RF1_4084.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RF1_4084.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RF1_4084.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RF1_4084.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RF1_4084.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/RF1_4084.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224602" class="wp-caption-text">Skyryse CEO Mark Groden. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Skyryse</p></div></p>
<p>“The reality is that the FAA minimums for getting a pilot’s license are not sufficient to be safe and effective; our goal is to make that so,” he said. “On average people estimate it takes 50 hours of driving experience to get your license. In contrast the FAA only requires 40 hours to become a private pilot.”</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the 40-hour requirement is not for all types of aircraft operations; for example, to fly a commercial carrier a pilot needs 1,500 hours of total flight time. But with Skyryse’s system, a less-experienced pilot could potentially take on new types of aircraft without lengthy additional training hours.</p>
<p>Skyryse currently has partnerships with five fixed-wing and rotorcraft equipment manufacturers, including Robinsons Helicopters. Before FlightOS will start appearing in an eVTOL or helicopter, it first must be certified by the FAA. Integrating into existing aircraft will likely shorten the process, as the company won’t need to certify an entirely new vehicle (what eVTOL developers must do, for example).</p>
<p>The startup says that its tech could even help with the global pilot shortage, a situation that may only become exacerbated if air taxis become operational this decade.</p>
<p>The fresh funding brings the startup’s total raised to $250 million. This recent round was led by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company and Monashee Investment Management, with additional participation from ArrowMark Partners, Republic Capital, Raptor Group, Infinite Capital, Embedded Ventures, Fortistar, K3 Ventures, Rosecliff, SV Pacific Ventures, Laurence Tosi, and Dmitry Balyasny. Prior investors Venrock, Eclipse Ventures, and Fontinalis Partners also participated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written a lot about fintechs that aim to help other fintechs and traditional banks launch products and services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it feels like we have written far less about fintechs that exist solely to help the incumbents better compete with fintechs.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://paywithextend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one such company. The New York-based startup, which provides digital payment infrastructure for financial institutions so they can offer virtual cards to their users, has raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by March Capital.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224564" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include B Capital, Point72 Ventures, Fintech Collective, Reciprocal Ventures, Wells Fargo and Pacific Western Bank. The latest financing brings Extend’s total raised since its 2017 inception to $55 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extend has integrated directly with major networks and processors — including Global Payments/TSYS, Mastercard and Visa — with the intent of building technology that supports virtual cards on top of the infrastructure banks are built upon. This means that card issuers can combine Extend’s offering with their current products, with “no technical implementation required,” according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Extend has more than 2,000 business customers currently using its applications, is growing 30% month-over-month and has a run rate of &#8220;close to $2 billion dollars” in processing volume, or the spend clients are making on its virtual cards, according to the company. It makes basis points on the transactions made on those cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Extend </span><a href="https://about.americanexpress.com/all-news/news-details/2021/American-Express-and-Extend-Partner-to-Enable-Virtual-Cards-for-U.S.-Small-and-Mid-Sized-Businesses/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inked a deal with American Express</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which allows its millions of small and mid-sized business card members to access virtual cards through their existing physical cards “in minutes.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have now exposed these digital capabilities to every existing cardholder,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Jamison, CEO and co-founder of Extend. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the first time that someone has turned virtual cards into a product in itself, rather than a feature on an existing piece of plastic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most competitors require a customer to switch bank partners and open a new account, and existing virtual card offerings have only been accessible at an enterprise level, said Jamison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extend, he claims, is the first company to deliver an issuer-agnostic solution for SMBs at scale with its “virtual card platform-as-a-service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeal to businesses as opposed to turning to startups in the space, according to Jamison, is that they don’t have to create a new account “to get access to the digital capabilities that they’ve been wanting to get in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in essence, we can add Extend to the growing list of companies focused on the corporate spend space, including Brex, Ramp, TripActions and others.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1axXH8PjHt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/brex-raises-300m-at-a-12-3b-valuation/">Brex just signed a term sheet for $300M at a $12.3B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brex just signed a term sheet for $300M at a $12.3B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/brex-raises-300m-at-a-12-3b-valuation/embed/#?secret=1axXH8PjHt" data-secret="1axXH8PjHt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamison previously worked at SAP and then American Express for a number of years, moving from London to the U.S. in 2009 to help the credit card giant incorporate new digital payment capabilities, one of which included virtual cards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">got involved when it was half a million dollars in volume, and it doubled over the course of five years as we saw this shift to digital over the course of that period of time,” he recalled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn’t easy. Virtual cards at the time were reserved for “only the biggest of all companies,” and the effort took engineers on both sides, Jamison said. Then, Marqeta started to power businesses directly with digital cards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I realized then this was the better way to get cards to people, and that this was clearly to be the future of card issuance over time,” he told TechCrunch. “And that was the genesis of Extend. The company was founded based on the recognition that we could take virtual cards and use them as a stepping stone to helping with the $40 billion payment industry transformation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fact that legacy platforms were “incredibly robust,” Jamison knew they were not built for the digital era we find ourselves in today. So he set about creating digital assets, or a broader connectivity framework, that would allow Extend to help banks scale capabilities across their whole portfolio “and eventually all the way down to the consumer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasizes that Extend does not underwrite or process transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We represent a place where we&#8217;ll be able to create 21st century technology and make the traditional banks look and feel like they were actually born in the 21st century,” Jamison said. “We help the incumbents close the gap relative to those players.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extend also offers a number of API solutions for banks and third-party service providers that it says can help them create new products for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 42-person company has also developed a “developer-friendly” API catalog which Jamison says is giving issuers a way to offer APIs to its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Extend has signed deals with seven traditional financial institutions, with the target of working with 20 by the end of next year. Citi National and PacWest are both customers and investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sumant </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mandal, co-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founder and managing partner of March Capital, said he was impressed with Jamison’s having spent over a decade at Amex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He understands that enabling modern payment solutions has become a mission critical priority for banks, especially as fintechs continue to challenge banks,” Mandal wrote via email. “Customers repeatedly highlighted the frictionless and consumer-grade experience, with onboarding taking less than five minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believes the company is unique in that it has been able to upgrade bank payment infrastructure “without the need to rip and replace an entire system,” so that banks can offer the same level of products and features as fintechs in the virtual card issuing and corporate expense management space.</span></p>

<p>Fellow co-founder and CEO Aydin Mirzaee told TechCrunch that unproductive meetings — you know, the ones that really could be emails — <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/37-billion-is-lost-every-year-on-these-meeting-mistakes-2014-4">cost U.S. companies $37 billion annually</a>. Instead, he believes that productive meetings are about collaborative agendas, recording history and following a process.</p>
<p>“Before when we were all in-person, no one brought any devices into a meeting, and now every meeting is on a device, which has opened up the landscape,” he explained. “It’s crazy to think that people haven’t built software for meetings in the past, but now it makes sense to have a platform across the company to make sure all meetings are productive.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224489" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The San Francisco-based meeting management software company, founded in 2017, provides tools all in one place that are meant to support all kinds of meetings. Fellow’s SaaS business model includes a free plan and tiers for additional users and organizational features.</p>
<p>Some of the features include agenda templates, action item identification, analytics for insights into how often people are meeting and integrations with virtual meeting software for note-taking.</p>
<p>Fellow’s list of customers includes Shopify, Hopin and GoCardless. Over the last year, the company saw that list more than triple, as did the number of meetings hosted on the platform. In addition, over 2 million meeting agendas and notes were recorded, and the company is on track to quadruple its revenue this year, Mirzaee said.</p>

<p>To continue on that trajectory, the company announced $24 million in Series A funding. Craft Ventures led the round and was joined by iNovia, Felicis, Garage Ventures, Formentera and SVB. The new funding will go toward product development, building its infrastructure and hiring in sales, marketing and customer success. It brings the company’s total funds raised to $30.5 million, according to the company.</p>

Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/productivity-management-software-market">global productivity management software</a> market reached $43 billion in 2020 and will grow 14% annually through 2028.</p>
<p>This has startups lining up to get a piece of it, and Fellow is one of the latest on a list that attracted venture capital attention. Just in the past month this has included:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/hera-is-a-new-calendar-app-for-people-with-a-lot-of-virtual-meetings/">Hera</a>, a virtual meeting calendar</li>

</ul>
<p>Mirzaee agrees there is competition but says there are few options that are purpose-built for meetings and Fellow’s approach is unique.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our vision is to build a meeting productivity product aimed at helping managers have productive meetings and then manage their teams,” he added. “There are few solutions out there purpose-built for meetings.”</p>
<p>Lainy Painter, partner at Craft Ventures, also pointed out that Fellow has been able to start out with one team and rapidly expand within an organization once they see how productive they can be.</p>
<p>Painter is a user of the tool, and with remote work here to stay, the meeting is just one of the workflows that had not been optimized yet.</p>
<p>“I see Fellow dominating the meeting management category,” she added. “We are still in the early stage of shifting to how we will be working with remote work, and though we saw a lot of that move in the early months to a Zoom interface, a lot of optimization was left on the table. The future of work and meetings is adopting new tools that take advantage of being fully remote and not just taking an existing paradigm and replicating it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies like Slack and Asana stormed into the world of tech to steal a march on incumbents like Microsoft in providing a new wave of point solutions to make it easier for workers respectively to chat with each other, plan projects and more. Now another startup is announcing a massive round of funding for a platform that it believes has its own unique role to play in disrupting enterprise IT: by providing a single, all-in-one solution covering various aspects of workplace productivity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.clickup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ClickUp</a>, which provides set of tools that lets its users tackle project management, document collaboration, spreadsheets, chat, and goals from a single platform &#8212; a little like Workday but for productivity &#8212; has raised $400 million, a Series C funding that the company confirmed values it at $4 billion post-money.</p>
<p>ClickUp said that this is, to date, the single-largest Series C in the workplace productivity market (others like Slack have raised bigger single rounds&#8230; so still room to grow!). Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global are co-leading the round, with Lightspeed Venture Partners and Meritech Capital Partners also participating. Craft Ventures and Georgian Partners are among its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/productivity-platform-clickup-raises-35-million-from-craft-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier backers</a>; the company has now raised $535 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224795" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>ClickUp &#8212; based out of San Diego &#8212; plans to use the funding to double down on growth in Europe, with 600 new jobs and a new HQ set for Ireland that will handle R&amp;D, operations and sales. The company counts the likes of Google (yes, the company behind its own productivity tools), McDonalds, Booking.com, and Netflix among its large enterprise customers. In all, ClickUp is being used by 800,000 teams &#8212; up from just 200,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>A significant proportion of ClickUp&#8217;s customers, some 40%, are already based outside of the U.S, with a large part of those users in Europe &#8212; some 275,000 teams in all, the company said &#8212; hence its interest in focusing more deeply in the region. It will also include localised versions of its platform for France, Germany and Spain, the company said.</p>
<p>The shift to cloud services and a rising appetite from knowledge workers to use tools in the office that work just as intuitively as their &#8220;fun&#8221; consumer mobile apps has led to a veritable revolution in the world of enterprise software.</p>
<p>Fueled by venture capital, startups have built out substantial businesses tackling different aspects of what &#8220;workplace productivity&#8221; can constitute, from tools to improve how to perform in a specific job like sales (Slack being now owned by the giant in that space, Salesforce), through to more specific workplace functionality like organising one&#8217;s calendar or meetings, writing and collaborating on documents, creating and managing a project, talking to each other about specific work tasks, and so much more. And big tech companies have not been outside of the game, either. Microsoft and the rest have all stepped up with their own takes on the same problems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But all this has also created a new kind of productivity problem in the process. Enterprises are often now dealing with a much wider range of apps in their typical workflow. This predicament is not small: it has cost, efficiency, management, security, and attention implications in varying degrees.</p>
<p>The solution here is pretty obvious: move back to all-in-one solutions that take out some of the noise and make it easier to share and hand off work throughout the lifecycle of productivity. It&#8217;s something that Microsoft, of course, is already addressing, as are others. But in the wider scheme of things, sometimes building a new set of tools from scratch can yield a much fresher, and better result.</p>
<p>&#8220;ClickUp&#8217;s sole purpose has always been to make the world more productive. Time is our most valuable resource and we are committed to giving people more time to focus on what matters most to them,&#8221; says Zeb Evans, CEO and Founder of ClickUp, in a statement. &#8220;We believe software should make people more productive and efficient. I&#8217;m thrilled about our next chapter and accelerating the innovations that deliver on this promise to our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors love almost nothing more than a fast-growing startup &#8212; and this one definitely fits the bill.</p>
<p>“ClickUp&#8217;s unique offering in the market has fueled their rise as one of the fastest-growing SaaS startups in the world. Their strong growth, product adoption, and customer retention reflect the tremendous value they&#8217;re providing to businesses looking to drive greater productivity and efficiency,” said David George, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in a statement. &#8220;ClickUp is synonymous with the future of work, and we&#8217;re thrilled to partner with a company that has shown such a strong commitment to its users and product. We look forward to building a more productive world together.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s network meltdown earlier this month &#8212; an outage that initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whatsapp-instagram-return/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stemmed from a configuration error</a> &#8212; was a huge pain for many users (and a big cost to Facebook). For enterprises, it also served as a poignant reminder about a salient fact of networks: The complexity and interdependency of systems today mean that when something doesn&#8217;t work between two entities &#8212; be it apps, servers or something else &#8212; the effects can be disastrous, unless those overlaps can be detected and mitigated ahead of a live deployment, or found and fixed quickly even if they are already out in the wild.</p>
<p>Today, a startup called <a href="https://gluware.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gluware</a> that has built a platform that aims to do just that &#8212; specifically by providing network orchestration and automation tools that identify and automatically fix when something is about to go awry on a network, described by the CEO to me as &#8220;RPA&#8221; for network ops &#8212; is announcing $43 million in funding to continue building out its business, in a growth round led by Bain Capital with participation from Acadia Woods Partners and other unnamed existing investors.</p>
<p>Gluware is not disclosing its valuation but from what we understand it is around $700 million, notable considering how little it&#8217;s raised to date (just under $47 million in the last 10 years, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/51648-22/company/profile#deal-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> data, and bootstrapped before that). It&#8217;s also notable for being based in California but <em>not</em> the Bay Area: it&#8217;s HQ is in Sacramento, <a href="https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/where-tech-workers-are-moving-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apparently a newly-emerging location</a> for people leaving more established tech enclaves.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224725" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a period where a number of enterprises have put the gas on network growth and operations to handle both increased traffic but also new working architectures for its people, Gluware said its ARR growth in the last year has been 400% (it does not disclose actual figures).</p>
<p>Gluware got its start originally as a Cisco shop, inking a strategic deal with the company early on to build orchestration and automation systems that ran specifically on its servers, specifically a software-defined wide-area network controller to work with Cisco kit. As networks evolved and became continually more complex, the opportunity changed and became about working in multi-vendor networks and for a variety of different enterprises that might not be the typical Cisco service provider customers. Its services now integrate, by way of APIs, to cover network operations across <a href="https://gluware.com/platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 30</a> different platforms and operating systems. Gluware&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Jeff Gray estimates that Gluware&#8217;s coverage currently points to a $10.8 billion addressable market.</p>
<p>Currently, and in keeping with changing use cases and architectures, Gluware&#8217;s sweet spot up to now has been working with larger enterprises in highly regulated sectors like healthcare or finance that are heavily dependent on cloud or hybrid network architectures that bring in many disparate operations, may lack large enough in-house teams to build and operate their own automation and orchestration solutions, but have a lot of requirements to stay operational and protect user data in the process. The list is heavy of Fortune 500 and Global 2000 names, with Mastercard, EY and Merck among them.</p>
<p>Large tech companies &#8212; web scalers, as Gray described them &#8212; were out of Gluware&#8217;s sights simply because they typically build and operate those tools in-house, and the idea was that Gluware was building tools for the rest of the market that performed just as well. However, as Gray put it, incidents like Facebook&#8217;s definitely change the game.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We haven’t been targeting the web scalers, and we presented ourselves as an alternative to DIY. Traditionally I have always said that if you are a Google, a FB or a Goldman Sachs, you could pour a tremendous amount of resource into scripts and build you own automation software,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But Facebook&#8217;s audit tool issued a r<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ogue command and broke its network, at scale. So  even the large web scalers of the world are not immune. I</span> think we could be a great fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s focus on network operations has a natural synergy with security operations, since many, but not all, outages covering, say, border gate protocol or domain name server errors have been linked also to data breaches, and that lays the groundwork for how Gluware sees its role in the network operations IT stack. Its tools can be applied to device management, operating system management, configuration modeling, workflows and more to minimize downtime, speed up operations, to meet compliance requirements, and more.</p>
<p>That long list, and Gluware&#8217;s traction to date in meeting its demands, are what have attracted investors. “As enterprises continue to struggle with network automation progress, Gluware’s unique platform delivers enhanced network security and agility while creating real business value and outcomes for customers,” said Olof Bergqvist, a Managing Director at Bain Capital, in a statement. “We are excited to support Gluware’s next phase of growth and accelerate the company’s innovative technology and mission-critical solutions to continue meeting the modern needs of enterprises while strengthening its value-proposition to its customers, suppliers and partners.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South African online healthcare marketplace <a href="https://www.recomed.co.za/">RecoMed</a> has raised a $1.5 million financing round, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> South Africa-focused venture capital firm Vunani Fintech Fund. RecoMed says the firm invested $1 million; the rest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between existing investors Japanese but Africa-focused VC firm AAIC, Growth Grid Venture Capital Partners and Kenyan-based Push Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/sheraanamod"> Sheraan Amod</a>, who, after a brief stay in the U.S. launching his first tech company, experienced for the first time what it was like to book medical appointments online, which wasn’t the case back in his home country South Africa.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224745" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amod felt an opportunity to fill this need and returned to South Africa to build RecoMed &#8212; the company he refers to as the “booking.com for healthcare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RecoMed acts as a marketplace where patients can find and book services with healthcare professionals across South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients can search through and browse practitioner profiles, check reviews and then book a physical or virtual telehealth appointment from the website or app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, healthcare practitioners, enterprises, and insurers use the platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">differently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practitioners adopt RecoMed’s platform as a standalone platform or via an integration with their external Practice Management System (PNS), a software program used to operate medical and healthcare practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For enterprises, RecoMed is white-labeled to allow booking and telehealth functionality for patient customer groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health insurers such as Discovery have adopted RecoMed to power digital healthcare bookings into doctors, clinics and other health professionals for their members, the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RecoMed’s platform helps improve access and healthcare delivery for patients by cutting down the time it would typically take to book the service they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RecoMed’s business model is to earn a transactional “per booking” fee from healthcare providers for all bookings generated via the platform. The aggregated marketplace increases patient booking flow to RecoMed’s health provider customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RecoMed, launched in 2013, has not raised more than $3 million but claims to be the largest and fastest-growing healthcare booking in South Africa. The startup says it powers over 200,000 bookings per month, which has grown 700% in 18 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform is one of the earliest adopters of telehealth in Africa, launching years before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic when the need for such platforms became more evident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although RecoMed did not raise the kind of eye-popping investments seen from its counterparts in other parts of the world, the company has benefited business-wise, positioning itself in assisting large corporates in conducting vaccinations across South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these companies include Discovery Health and Mediclinic. They have conducted over 550,000 bookings via RecoMed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are facilitating over R250m [$16m] of healthcare spend </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whether a patient is looking for a convenient doctor appointment or the COVID-19 vaccine jab, we make it simple and easy to do,” Amod said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic also resulted in a net uplift for the usage of RecoMed, the CEO said. The company’s revenue has more than doubled since March this year, he adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per other metrics, over 2,500 contracted health providers on RecoMed and more than 1 million customers use the platform annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RecoMed plans to use this funding to add new integrated products to its platform in 2022. Some include integrated online medical payments and e-pharmacy for delivering prescription medication to consumers across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to new product releases, RecoMed is also targeting further geographic expansion, with the company launching in Kenya in January 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthtech faces unique challenges around infrastructure in Africa. The market forces and the patchwork of systems used in healthcare </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have made it essential to devise local healthcare technology solutions to African problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amod believes the go-to-market approach for broad-based solutions in health-tech should involve a solid B2B2C element, using key partnerships with insurers, banks and telecommunication companies to reach a mass consumer audience &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what RecoMed is executing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The future of health innovation is an exciting space for Africa as we continue to offer the global market a scalable solution at low cost-and where necessary with low bandwidth, which has never </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anywhere else in the world,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead investor Vunani Fintech Fund, optimistic about RecoMed’s proposed approach to meet identified market needs in South Africa, said via its director Mark Anderson, “We are still in the early days of leveraging technology as a utility in healthcare, so the potential here is massive. We are confident that this latest round of fundraising will make a major contribution towards promoting greater efficiencies in the health ecosystem that will benefit all stakeholders.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Israeli startup <a href="https://tactilemobility.com/">Tactile Mobility</a> uses existing vehicle sensor data to enable cars to “feel” the road in a way that generates insights about both the vehicle and the road via its cloud platform. On Wednesday, Tactile announced a $27 million Series C raise which it will use to further develop its virtual sensors, expand its product offerings and bolster its cloud platform &#8212; all of which will require up to 20 new hires in R&amp;D this year, according to Shahar Bin-Nun, CEO of Tactile Mobility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding round, which brings Tactile’s total funding to $47 million, was led by Delek Motors, with strategic investment from Goodyear Ventures and Porsche Ventures and support from Union Group, The Group Ventures, Zvi Neta (AEV), Giora Ackerstein and Doron Livnat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our company is basically divided into two parts &#8212; the data acquisition and the data monetization,” Bin-Nun told TechCrunch. “We do data acquisition with a very unique piece of software that we call the Tactile Processor (TP), which is installed in the engine control unit of the chassis. With the TP, we are able to create numerous non-visual virtual sensors for the OEM that mostly improve safety, performance and enjoyability of the driving.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224628" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second part of Tactile’s business model revolves around its cloud platform, called Tactile Cloud (TC), which is where data from the virtual sensors are uploaded in order to create tactility maps that describe either vehicle DNA or road surface DNA. Those maps can then be sold to OEMs, transport authorities, municipalities, insurance companies, tire companies, Tier 1s and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the 23 virtual sensors Bin-Nun says Tactile engages in vehicles, the major one the company has worked on is its tire grip estimation with BMW, which measures the grip between the car and the road while a car is cruising. Tactile’s TP is in 2.5 million BMW vehicles annually, according to the CEO, which means millions of vehicles are passively mapping road surfaces for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mapping the roads by measuring tire grip enables Tactile to map things like potholes, cracks in the road, slipperiness, snowfall and more. The insights can be gathered in real time and downloaded to other vehicles roaming in a specific area, which might give drivers a heads-up to poor road conditions and improve safety. Analytics can also be shared via a report for third parties like mapping companies, road authorities or fleet managers to identify areas of distress on the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tactile has a revenue share model with the OEMs it works with so that it is able to monetize whatever data it collects in its cloud. Bin-Nun says the startup has done more than 30 proof of concepts and pilots with seven OEMs, but it has only reached production-level capabilities with BMW. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Up until now, we’ve been a company of 25; now we are 40 employees, so we were a bit limited in our ability to expand,” said Bin-Nun. “You can imagine that as a small company running a project for BMW, we were completely busy with the implementation and integration with BMW and all the tests we had to do to be compliant with their requests, so we want to now be able to work in parallel with many OEMs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means also developing its other sensors so the company can offer more services and insights to customers. For example, some OEMs are interested in tire health. Tactile says it can measure the tread depth of the tire extremely accurately while driving, which can tell OEMs if the tire needs to be replaced or how a driver should drive given the type of tire and the terrain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another important one and the reason Goodyear invested in the company is that we can accurately measure if the tire is too stiff or not,” said Bin-Nun. “They did a test with us just after they invested in this round. So the tire health family of virtual sensors is definitely an important type of virtual sensors that we develop. Other OEMs ask for things like weight estimation and center of gravity, things that our virtual sensors pick up on and we use machine learning and signal processing to clean up a lot of noise.”</span></p>
<p>Other sensors include weight estimation, aquaplaning, vehicle health sensors and micro collisions. With the Series C funding, Tactile hopes to be able to build out these sensors so it can be more appealing to OEMs. The startup&#8217;s goal is to be inside every major OEM, which will give it massive scores of data to collect, analyze and monetize, which will help it develop in tandem with burgeoning tech, like autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Connected and autonomous driving are key to the future of people and goods movement,&#8221; said Abhijit Ganguly, managing director, Goodyear Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;For improved safety and efficiency of connected and autonomous driving, tire data is key.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Munich-based QOA is gearing up to be among the first to bring a chocolate product to market that is 100% cocoa free.</p>
<p>It is also now backed by $6 million in seed funding in an investment round led by Cherry Ventures with participation by Fifty Years, World Fund, Nucleus Capital, Trellis Road, Pioneer Fund and Tet Ventures.</p>
<p>The company kicked off this year, founded by the sister-and-brother team of Drs. Sara and Maximilian Marquart.

<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1638/chocolate-industry/">global chocolate confectionery industry</a> was valued at over $208 billion in 2020, and is the <a href="https://www.franchisehelp.com/industry-reports/chocolate-industry-analysis-2020-cost-trends/">largest part of the industry in the U.S</a>. Two-thirds of the world’s cocoa supply comes from West Africa, but is at risk — one of the reasons the Marquarts decided to focus on it. Currently, up to 50% of the current <a href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/in-the-field/global-climate-related-risks-in-cocoa-website-project/#:~:text=Global%20climate%20change%20already%20negatively,diseases%2C%20and%20more%20erratic%20rainfall.">cocoa supply is at risk</a> due to pathogens and climate change, and cocoa is playing a role in both <a href="https://engagethechain.org/cocoa">deforestation</a> and <a href="https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/importing-risk/cocoa/">forced child labor</a>.</p>
<p>“Our food supply is threatened due to the way we eat,” Max Marquart told TechCrunch. “We love chocolate, however, we realized that there are some sustainability risks and wanted to do something about it so we can still have it in the future.”</p>
<p>Companies, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/from-improving-cancer-treatments-to-saving-the-bees-these-are-the-companies-in-indiebios-latest-class/">California Cultured</a> and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/disruptive-new-company-voyage-foods-tackles-the-worlds-biggest-issues-in-food-commoditization-301367787.html">Voyager Foods</a>, are also creating chocolate without the cocoa using different approaches. Meanwhile, QOA developed a fermentation process that uses natural byproducts from other food-making processes for its base material. It then uses proprietary microbactera and flavor formation to create a vegan product that mimics the texture and flavor of chocolate, but without any artificial additives, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fermentation process will enable the company to scale production by 2035 and be able to price its products the same or below the cost of traditional chocolate. In fact, Marquart is predicting that in the future, the chocolate market will have two pillars: one half that is exclusive, expensive products made with normal cocoa, and the other QOA products.</p>
<p>QOA was part of Y Combinator this year and was able to get its product test kit going so people can sample nine options. Marquart expects to have QOA’s first product on the market in 2022, and the new funding will go toward building out its first pilot production facility in Munich to complement one it has in Switzerland and hiring.</p>
<p>The company is in talks with its first business-to-business customers and expects to close some smaller contracts soon, Marquart  said.</p>
<p>“After that, we will go after our Series A so we can build out larger production lines,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap said today it has amassed 100 million monthly active users in India, an impressive feat in the key overseas market where Facebook and Google reach over half a billion people, and is inking deals with a range of firms including Android smartphone vendors, entertainment TV channels Sony and Zee TV and e-commerce giant Flipkart to make further inroads in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>At a virtual event on Wednesday, Snap co-founder and chief executive Evan Spiegel shared the milestone, highlighting some of the company’s localization efforts that has helped to make inroads in India. The milestone and scores of partnerships today mark Snap’s major shift in strategy for the Indian market, where until two to three years ago it had a limited presence and relevance. (Snap has over 500 million monthly active users worldwide.)</p>
<p>The company has cracked India in recent years after it improved its Android app. More than 98% of smartphones in India run Android. Snap appointing Durgesh Kaushik as its head for the India business has also significantly helped the firm develop and improve relationships with local creators and businesses, many of them have told TechCrunch in recent quarters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We have made significant investments to localize the Snapchat experience for the Indian community. We have added culturally relevant content, developed highly active and creative local creator communities, and invested in local products, marketing initiatives, and language support,” said Spiegel at the event.</p>
<p>“Following these efforts to bring a localized experience to Indian Snapchatters, we now reach 100 million Snapchatters monthly in India. We will continue to anchor our efforts around celebrating local culture and talent, while empowering, growing, and providing resources for our community of Indian creators.”</p>
<p>At the company’s second annual event for India, Snap also announced a number of partnerships it has inked to accelerate its growth in the country. It has formed a “strategic partnership” with Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart to develop AR experiences. The company said this is the first time it has formed a partnership of this kind with an e-commerce firm.</p>
<p>“Through this partnership, shoppers will be able to begin their shopping and e-commerce engagement journey through Snapchat AR, making the process easy from the comfort of their homes!” the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snap has also partnered with India’s Sugar Cosmetics and MyGlamm, both of which will now adopt Snap’s AR shopping beta program to offer virtual beauty and makeup try-on experiences to customers.</p>
<p>“Augmented reality is at the core of Snapchat’s offerings in India. Our efforts to stay culturally relevant and offer unique AR experiences have resonated with 100 million Indian Snapchatters. We have worked towards empowering students and youth with essential AR Skills through workshops and lensathons,” said Bobby Murphy, Snap co-founder and chief technology officer, at the event.“We aim to partner with more local creators in India to grow the number of incredible experiences available to Snapchatters. At Snap, our intent is to make AR more accessible, useful and practical than ever before.”</p>
<p>In another India-first initiative, Snap said it has partnered with all top Android original equipment manufacturers (or Android vendors) that together have an install base of over 100 million devices in the country. These firms will pre-install the Snapchat app on their devices. There’s also a partnership with Samsung to offer a “Fun Mode” to bring some Snap’s AR-powered Lenses to Samsung’s India-focused M Series of smartphones.</p>
<p>The company also released a number of Creator Shows including &#8216;What’s On My Plate&#8217; featuring Anushka Sen and Vir Das and The Most Epic Max Show and said it is commissioning 120 episodes of new content overall in India for the next year.</p>
<p>The company said its Discover section has become very popular in India. The section features content from 70 local Indian channels across news, fashion, entertainment, and comedy. It&#8217;s now planning to populate the app with even more curated content it said, announcing tie-ups with leading entertainment channels such as Sony Entertainment Television and Zee TV.</p>
<p>The company said its India business has also rapidly expanded its monetisation capabilities to cater to businesses of all shapes and sizes. It saw an increase of net new advertisers by 70% last year and has worked with firms such as Spotify, Swiggy, LG, OnePlus, and ITC Yippee Noodles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Surveys have long been used by marketing teams and other business decision makers to learn how customers tick. But they can be costly to put together, hard to run at scale, and, at the end of the day, are only as credible as the data that gets put into them. Today, a London startup called <a href="https://www.askattest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attest</a>, which has built a cloud-based, no-code, big-data solution that it believes provides an answer to those challenges, is announcing $60 million in growth funding, in the wake of record business growth in the last couple of years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jeremy King, the company&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, says that its machine learning-based approach is gaining traction against the many incumbent players in the field of online market research &#8212; there are hundreds of them ranging from Kantar and SurveyMonkey through to Qualtrics and many more &#8212; because it provides faster and more accurate results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The dark secret is that most online research has been very low quality,&#8221; he said in an interview, noting that if you took the same brief to five traditional market research organizations, you&#8217;d likely get five different sets of responses, not unlike taking one building brief to five architects. Attest&#8217;s ambition is to move away from that and build a much more consistent, and thus reliable, framework for market research.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224488" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are trying to make it as good as we can get it. It&#8217;s still not perfect but at least we are trying, and most online research frankly doesn’t try at all,&#8221; King said. He also described the company&#8217;s methodology as &#8216;suicidally transparent.&#8217; It&#8217;s a pitch that indeed does sound pretty honest, and yet it seems to have struck a chord with a lot of big names. Its customer list includes <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Microsoft, Santander, Walgreens/Boots, Klarna, Brew Dr. Kombucha, Fabletics, eToro and Publicis, among <a href="https://www.askattest.com/customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The investment is coming from returning investor NEA and Kismet, along with other unnamed backers, and Attest said that it brings the total it has raised to date to $85 million. Other investors in the company have included Oxford Capital and Episode 1 (which co-led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/market-research-tech-startup-attest-raises-3-1m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.1 million round in 2019</a>). </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Attest is not disclosing its valuation, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/market-research-tech-startup-attest-raises-3-1m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a> reveals that it was just under $273 million post-money in August of this year, when this latest round appears to have actually closed. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">As you might expect from a startup working in the world of data, Attest has some pretty compelling data points of its own.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The startup has built out a massive database that is aggregated from hundreds of individual panels, user groups and more, altogether totaling 110 million consumers across 49 countries. Its promise is that any user (no tech expertise required) can create a survey within minutes to target any segment of users that it wants out of that bigger pool and will get responses back in 24 hours if not sooner.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Within those results, Attest guarantees the data in terms of response numbers and integrity using a complex set of algorithms as part of what King described as a 15-step process that starts with formulating questions, sourcing audiences, processing the data and providing it in visualizations that are useful to the person doing the research. It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.askattest.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">priced</a> on a freemium model, where those on paid tiers basically buy credits that are used based on one credit equalling one response per question. These credits work out to ranging in price between 40 cents and 60 cents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">King said that Attest does not rely on paying users, nor placing surveys in access gates, nor building campaigns that run on social media and are built on asking questions that are indirectly mapped on to your demographic (the dreaded &#8216;Which 1980s Brat Packer are you?&#8217;). These, King says, are gateways to low-quality data, since people usually only click on them to get them out of the way. Instead, it relies on those algorithms, which in part are designed to figure out which kinds of audiences are most useful and receptive to answering the questions you are asking. That being said, those building questions can also opt to work with actual humans at Attest if they need help figuring out useful questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Surveys and the bigger topic of &#8220;consumer engagement&#8221; have been something of a hot-button issue in the last several years, not least because of the roles that they potentially play in areas like data collection and how that data ultimately might be tied to a particular user. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/?guccounter=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some believe</a> that Facebook, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/lawmakers-confront-tiktok-snapchat-and-youtube-about-eating-disorder-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other social media companies</a> that have built their business models on engagement, have a lot to answer for in how they build experiences and tweak algorithms to surface more engaging content, irrespective of the quality or nature of the media in question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">King says that what Attest does is a big step removed from all of that: although full of complexity and technology at the back end, at the front end they are more old school and direct, aimed at figuring out, for example, whether Bertolli olive oil should finally come clean and admit it&#8217;s not Italian, but in fact Spanish in origin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In what is estimated to be an $80 billion market, as data becomes more of a support &#8212; and in some cases a replacement for &#8212; basic intuition in business decision-making, King said the company has seen a growing demand for more surveying on its platform, and that is why investors are interested, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Today’s investment underscores our commitment to Attest and our belief in their stellar team and innovative technology, which is revolutionising access to high quality consumer insights for brands around the world at such an exciting scale,&#8221; said Colin Bryant, a partner at NEA, in a statement. “In the current climate, the need to tap into consumer behavior has never been higher, and we’ve seen how Attest has facilitated growth for brands across the pandemic. We foresee the demand for consumer data only getting stronger.”</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Attest is on a trajectory to overtake all incumbents in the market research space, and has its eyes firmly on the largest prizes,&#8221; added Asheque Shams, General Partner at Kismet. &#8220;We are a startup investment firm with a mission to help fast-growing tech companies reach their greatest potential, so we are immensely excited to partner with Jeremy and team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://union54.com/">Union54</a>, the first Zambian startup backed by Y Combinator, has gotten another major venture capital firm on its term sheet: Tiger Global</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company confirmed to TechCrunch that the VC juggernaut led its just-completed $3 million seed round, coming only two months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/the-first-zambian-startup-to-get-into-yc-is-developing-africas-first-card-issuing-api/">graduating</a> from Y Combinator’s summer batch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based venture capital firm Runa Capital, Ace &amp; Company, Todd &amp; Rahul Angel Fund and Vibe VC participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Zambian fintech also received checks from angel investors such as Babs Ogundeyi, the CEO of Nigerian neobank Kuda; Risana Zitha, managing director of Renaissance Capital; and Gbenga Ajayi, former director of SMB Growth at Wise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Union54 is an API that allows African software companies to issue and manage their debit cards without needing a bank or third-party processor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founders and couple <a href="https://zm.linkedin.com/in/perseus">Perseus Mlambo</a> and <a href="https://zm.linkedin.com/in/alessandra-martini-zazu">Alessandra Martini</a> started Union54 this year as a spinoff from their previous company, <a href="https://www.zazuafrica.com/">Zazu</a>, a challenger bank they launched six years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Card issuing is a space that is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> becoming regionalized, owing to different regulations per geography. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at Zazu, the founders found it difficult and time-consuming to issue cards to its customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While working on the problem, they identified the skewed incentives when interacting with card issuers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And they launched Union54 not only to solve that problem for themselves but other fintechs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since joining Y Combinator, Zazu has been in stealth mode and only went live this month, CEO Mlambo told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that over 50 companies are currently in Union54’s API sandbox environment. They range from digital banks to post-Series A fintechs and “companies founded on the basis of Union54’s availability.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four companies are currently live in production and have begun issuing virtual cards to their customers. Mlambo says 30 more could join before the end of the year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these companies, the average time it takes to start production and begin issuance takes three to nine days, said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its partners include African unicorn Flutterwave and newer companies such as Payday and Plumter (cross-border fintechs) and crypto exchange platform Bitmama.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what else has changed since the company spoke to TechCrunch in August? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve realized that there’s such a huge potential for companies who want to monetize their existing customer bases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But we didn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a firm idea of how we would do that. Now, we do and we are the only company in Africa to would give you [fintechs] the interchange.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, here’s how the interchange works — Union54 onboards a fintech company and it uses Union54’s API to issue a single card to an employee. When the employee uses the card to pay for stuff online, perhaps </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Netflix subscription or AWS invoice of $30, the fintech earns 1% of that transaction, in this case, $0.30.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While that might look minute, imagine a fintech that uses Union54’s API to issue cards to more than 20,000 customers who use it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s where the Zambian startup hopes to create value: to help fintechs earn significant revenue from interchange without doing a lot of the heavy lifting linked with card management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only are we allowing fintechs to go to market faster than any bank or card issuer could ever dream of doing, but we’re also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing that our incentives are very much aligned,” said Mlambo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We only make money when they do and that’s why we’re happy to give a guarantee with that interchange</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking about the investment for Runa Capital, general partner Andre Bliznyuk said the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support Union54’s efforts to “supercharge the African fintech ecosystem by enabling their customers to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launch new card-based products and deliver tangible value to the consumers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global declined to comment on the investment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s rather interesting that the investment firm is writing its fourth investment in an African fintech startup this year after Flutterwave <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">in March</a>, FairMoney <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/">in July</a> and Mono, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/tiger-global-backs-african-fintech-mono-in-15m-series-a-round/">this month</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a more impressive fact: Union54 seems to be its first bet outside Nigeria or South Africa, two of Africa’s four most dominant tech ecosystems, including Kenya and Egypt. Tiger Global had invested in Nigerian startups Jobberman, Cheki and Wakanow, and South African e-commerce company Takealot this past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A far cry from Nigeria and South Africa’s bubbling tech ecosystem, Zambia has a relatively quiet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startup and venture capital scene; therefore, Tiger Global’s participation in Union54’s seed round is a massive win for the southern African nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In retrospect, though, Mlambo and Martini’s experience as founders of Zazu, where they raised over $2 million as one of Zambia’s most funded startups, cannot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be written</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> off as a contributor to Union54’s seeming success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mlambo stated that when the company was raising this round, it prioritized speed and looked for a global partner due to the limitations imposed by its primary location in Zambia. And Tiger Global wasted no time proving it was the investor Union54 wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The discussion with Tiger was pretty straightforward; they committed pretty </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the process was pretty smooth,” the CEO remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Union54,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the founders are taking on a pan-African problem, not a Zambian one. Consequently, the task ahead is in multiples, but so is the reward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Mlambo claims that Union54, in less than a month of operation, currently transacts more than Zazu’s volume after its first 10 months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mlambo touts Zambia as a solid place to carry out business. However, he says it’s been challenging to convince people to move to Zambia for work, so</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Union54 has had to rely on remote work (which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the norm now) for most of its startup life. It currently has a lean team of 10 located in Nigeria, Malawi, South Africa, Zambia, and Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Union54 plans to use this investment to ramp up recruitment across engineering, product, marketing, and sales teams</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Zambian company will also use the funds to expand its regional customer base.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The purpose of this funding is to help us find the best of African talent, people who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to work on big problems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The investment helps us to be able to go to them and say, ‘hey, we’re a well-funded company, we’ve got customers using us, we’re earning revenue and this is going to be one of the most important companies to come out of Africa.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But conclusively, the goal, Mlambo said, is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">place the company in a stronger position to raise an attractive Series A within the next few months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma, a Ghanaian health startup, has taken a controlling stake in Uganda’s Vine Pharmacy for an undisclosed amount, marking the firm’s entry into its latest market in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma disclosed to TechCrunch that it has acquired a 55 percent stake previously held by  the Abraaj Group, a private equity firm that collapsed after investors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, sounded an alarm over the administration of its $1 billion healthcare fund. Abraaj bought Vine Pharmacy in 2013 when it was the largest pharmacy chain in Uganda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vine Pharmacy take-over comes two years after the health startup bought Kenya’s Haltons Pharmacy for $5 million marking mPharma’s foray into the East Africa region.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vine used to be the biggest pharmacy chain in Uganda. At its peak, it had about 36 stores spread across the country. But with Abraaj as its largest shareholder, the business had to resize once there wasn’t any more capital available for growth. We are buying out the stake that Abraaj held,” mPharma co-founder and CEO Gregory Rockson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockson said that he hopes to take Vine Pharmacy to its former glory, when it held the position of the biggest retail pharmacy chain in Uganda. Vine Pharmacy had 20 branches across Uganda when Abraaj took over and embarked on an aggressive growth plan that involved doubling its branches by 2018 – a feat it accomplished until the PE collapsed leading to the shutdown of several outlets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abraaj also grew the pharmacy’s wholesale business, supplied government agencies and health institutions, and expanded to include personalized patient care through home visits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma was originally founded in 2013, by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-rockson-43804449/?originalSubdomain=gh"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-shoukimas-33933a35?originalSubdomain=il"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Daniel Shoukimas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-nishiyama-finucane-295ab768/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Finucane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manage prescription drug inventory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for pharmacies and their suppliers. It currently runs retail pharmacy operations and provides market intelligence to hospitals, pharmacies and patients</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It remains one of the well-funded startups across Africa, raising over $50 million since inception, including </span><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/26/mpharma-raises-17m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Series C round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of $17 million, led by the CDC Group, the U.K.’s development finance institution, last year. Other </span><a href="https://medium.com/mpharma-insights/mpharma-raises-6-6-million-in-series-a-funding-463dafda6e0b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing investors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include Silicon Valley backer Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital, Shravin Bharti Mittal of the Bharti Global Limited, Social Capital and Golden Palm Investments. It also enjoys backing from </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-foulkes-54316910"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helena Foulkes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former president of CVS, the largest pharmacy retail chain in the U.S., and Daniel Vasella, ex-CEO and chairman of Novartis; both are members of the board.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can tell you Vine is a very profitable pharmacy chain. It&#8217;s been a family-owned business for almost 30 years, and so, we are really trying to use this moment to scale the business,” Rockson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a really exciting time for us and fortunately, Uganda is an exciting market. It may be like five years behind Kenya, but we think it is ripe for innovation and disruption,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma’s recently announced that it was rolling out</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/mpharma-a-telehealth-pioneer-out-of-ghana-gets-physical-with-100-virtual-centers-across-africa/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">telemedicine services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across its network of pharmacies in the continent in its efforts to bridge the doctor to patient gap by providing all-inclusive services. It plans to use its network of pharmacies to build what it describes as a digital primary care service that will</span><a href="https://medium.com/mpharma-insights/telemedicine-2-0-mpharmas-vision-to-transform-primary-care-in-africa-576fad3152cb"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">offer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all-in-one diagnostics services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year,</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma entered Ethiopia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after striking a franchising deal with Belayab Pharmaceuticals through its subsidiary, Haltons Limited. The Ethiopian pharmaceutical firm is part of Belayab Group — a franchisee of companies like Pizza Hut and Kia Motors — in the country.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma plans to continue its franchising model when expanding into new markets. This, Rockson said, will help the startup to focus more on building and refining its infrastructure for a seamless sourcing and distribution system that would address the challenges facing the pharmaceutical market across Africa, including unpredictable supply chains, exorbitant prices and low orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, mPharma set-up operations in Gabon after the West African country contracted it to build drug supply chain infrastructure, increasing the startups footprint in the provision of pharmaceutical systems and distribution networks across the continent. Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi and Rwanda are the other markets the tech startup has operations in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm also partnered with Mt. Meru Group, a gas station operator in Rwanda, last November to establish pharmacy branches within its outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Within less than a year, we&#8217;ve been able to rapidly build the largest retail platform in the country. Today, Rwanda is a very promising market for us,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The African pharmaceutical market is expected to grow exponentially as the population balloons, thus providing a space for innovation and a market for startups offering mobile health solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across Africa, Deloitte says in a </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nl/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/deloitte-nl-mhealth.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, East Africa is the most promising region in terms of healthcare investment owing to its integration and the growing economy, supported by various sectors, including agriculture and tourism. The increased demand for services and products as consumers gain more spending power will also lead to an increase in healthcare and telecom spend, the report said – opportunities that mPharma hopes to tap.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Based in Hong Kong,<a href="https://www.finverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Finverse</a>’s ambitious goal is to enable open banking throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The startup recently came out of stealth mode with $1.8 million in seed funding, and is now live in four markets (Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam) with connections to 30 banks. Founder and chief executive officer Stephane Lesaffre told TechCrunch that Finverse plans to launch in one new market per quarter, with the goal of covering about 75% of consumer and SMEs banks in each place.</p>
<p>Participants in Finverse’s seed round included Febe Ventures, Golden Gate Ventures, SixThirty, Venturra and angel investors.</p>
<p>Finverse is among a crop of fintechs developing APIs that allow easier sharing of financial data. The most prominent examples include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/plaid-raises-425m-series-d-from-altimeter-as-it-charts-a-post-visa-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plaid</a> in the United States and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/swedens-tink-raises-103m-as-its-open-banking-platform-grows-to-3400-banks-and-250m-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tink</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/truelayer-70m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truelayer</a> in Europe (Finverse’s seed funding included angel investment from Truelayer employees).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224666" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before starting Finverse in 2020, Lesaffre was senior product manager of financial data integrations at NerdWallet, working with account aggregation APIs like Plaid and legacy player Yodlee.</p>
<p>Plaid won the U.S. market because it was reliable and developer-friendly, Lesaffre said. It did not offer as much data coverage as Yodlee, but “what it did do is a very narrowly-focused set of data very well, and very easy to build. My ultimate learning from NerdWallet is that bad data is really worse than no data.”</p>
<p>Finverse wants to do the same thing for the Asia-Pacific region by building dependable APIs and data integrations. “At the core, we are a basically a consent-based data pipe where a consumer allows Finverse to connect to their account and share it with another fintech or financial institution,” said Lesaffre.</p>
<p>This can include information about accounts, balances, transaction histories and bank statements. Accessing this data gives financial institutions a sense of the consumer’s assets and liabilities, and can be used to perform things like income estimates, credit checks and gauge ability to repay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brankas wants to bring Southeast Asia&#8217;s banks and e-commerce into the digital era&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/brankas/embed/#?secret=pmA9W2gjQI" data-secret="pmA9W2gjQI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lesaffre said that Finverse’s early adopters are mostly fintech startups, including a mix of SME lending providers and buy now, pay later services.</p>
<p>Finverse’s APIs can be used for a wide range of use cases, but most of its current potential clients are focused on consumer or SME lending. Many of them want to transition from a heavily manual process that requires applicants to upload documents, to a digitized credit decision that can take as little as one minute.</p>
<p>Finverse is currently focused on banked consumers, or people who have traditional bank accounts and credit histories, but over time it also plans to add digital wallets, neobanks and other less traditional institutions. Future use cases include financial tracking as more people in Asia start using e-wallets, investment apps and online bank accounts.</p>
<p>“If you are a smaller digital bank, you know that a lot of your customers will have another primary account at a larger bank, so a lot of smaller banks are quite keen to be able to get a full perspective on their consumers,” said Lesaffre. “One way to do that is to let consumers track all their accounts in one place.”</p>
<p>Another use case for Finverse’s APIs is cross-border payments verification, compliance and KYC.</p>
<p>Other open banking startups focused on Southeast Asia include Brankas and Finantier. Lesaffre said Finverse’s approach is different because it is targeting the entire Asia-Pacific region, instead of focusing on specific markets. Its new funding will be used to grow its engineering and business development teams.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Growing reliance on SaaS has opened the door to shadow IT: SaaS applications bought by individual employees without the knowledge or approval of their organization’s IT department.</p>
<p>While shadow IT can be an <a href="https://www.i-cio.com/innovation/consumerization/item/how-cios-start-to-view-shadow-it-as-a-catalyst-for-innovation">opportunity for innovation</a>, if left unaddressed, it can lead to risks like duplicate subscriptions, wasted IT spend, a lack of compliance and greater risk of a data breach.</p>
<p>By leveraging SaaS management and taking some steps, businesses can more effectively manage shadow IT, gain a competitive edge, reduce unnecessary costs and empower a distributed workforce.</p>
<p>To avoid the negative consequences associated with shadow IT, you need to give IT teams visibility into your organization’s entire SaaS portfolio. Once IT has a line of sight into all applications in use and how they are used, they are positioned to optimize investments. Maximize your SaaS investments with these tips:</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Implementing self-service SaaS at your organization is easier than you may think.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Discover all SaaS applications and spending</h2>
<p>Some organizations take a spreadsheet-based approach to managing their SaaS applications. Others turn to web browser plugins, single sign-on tools and cloud access security brokers. But these discovery processes can be time-consuming and involve piecing together SaaS inventories from disparate sources, often resulting in records that are out of date before they’re even completed.</p>
<p>Even the most detailed, frequently updated spreadsheet is not always the most effective way to manage SaaS, especially when you consider that organizations manage over <a href="https://zylo.com/blog/zylo-2020-saas-management-benchmarks/">650 SaaS applications</a> on average, and they underestimate the number of SaaS applications within their ecosystem by two to three times. If you don’t know a SaaS application exists, how can you manage and budget for it?</p>
<p>To optimize your SaaS portfolio, you have to start with gaining complete visibility. Tools like SaaS management platforms with machine learning capabilities that detect SaaS purchases enable continuous discovery of software. These solutions can also integrate with your financial management systems to discover purchases.</p>
<p>It’s critical for this strategy to happen in real time so you have a picture of your tech ecosystem that’s always complete, accurate and up to date.</p>
<h2>Optimize and rightsize licenses and features</h2>
<p>Do you have as many active users as you accounted for or could you downgrade your plan? Perhaps an employee left, but their accounts were never deactivated. In practice, you may not need all the premium features or seats you’ve paid for, which means there could be opportunities to reduce your SaaS spend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zolve, a neobanking startup that aims to help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/">immigrants in the U.S. gain access to financial services</a>, said on Wednesday it has raised $40 million in a new financing round as it begins to roll out its offerings.</p>
<p>Partners of DST Global led the Bangalore-headquartered startup’s Series A financing round. The round, which values the 10-month-old startup at $210 million and brings its all-time raise to $55 million, also saw participation from Tiger Global and Alkeon Capital and existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Accel.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of students and working professionals leave India for the U.S. each year to pursue higher education and for work. Even after spending months in a new country, they struggle to get a credit card from local banks, and end up paying a premium to access a range of other financial services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224559" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Raghunandan G, a high-profile Indian entrepreneur who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/olaforsure/">sold his previous startup to ride-hailing giant Ola</a>, set out to solve this problem for Indians earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://zolve.com">Zolve</a> rolled out its credit card to 2,000 customers (and amassed a waiting list that has surpassed 70,000) last month and immediately identified two insights, he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Not only were the customers extensively using Zolve’s services and paying on time, he said, but the startup had also organically attracted demands from individuals who had immigrated from other nations such as Australia, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2224598 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="523" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our basic value proposition is a credit card. Other than a credit card, you also get a local bank account and a debit card. We never expected our customers to deposit money to their bank accounts. And we thought even if someone deposits money, it would probably be a few hundred or thousand dollars. What we saw is that people are depositing tens of thousands of dollars and using this account as their primary bank account,” he said. “We are currently sitting on a deposit of $2 million.”</p>
<p>The logical result of this early traction is that Zolve now plans to expand its offerings to immigrants from several nations early next year, he said.</p>
<p>Zolve currently works with banks in the U.S. and India to provide consumers access to financial products seamlessly — without paying any premium or coughing up any security deposit. It underwrites the risks, which has enabled banks in foreign countries to extend their services to Zolve customers.</p>
<p>Working with banks in India has helped Zolve gain clarity on the individuals and do the underwriting. The startup now plans to replicate this model for customers from other nations.</p>
<p>Raghunandan said the startup was fortunate enough to identify and bring on-board the investors it wanted. He pointed out that many of the partners at DST Global are immigrants themselves and the three new investors have backed several startups that operate in similar spaces.</p>
<p>“Access to tailored and fair financial products has a direct and meaningful impact on people&#8217;s lives. We&#8217;re incredibly excited to have invested in Zolve, and to support Raghu&#8217;s vision of bringing world-class financial services products and experiences to immigrants in the US and other markets,” said Bejul Somaia, partner at Lightspeed, in a statement.</p>
<p>“The company&#8217;s rapid acceleration, especially around customer acquisition and usage, is a reflection of the team&#8217;s execution capability and significant unmet needs of Zolve&#8217;s target customer base. We&#8217;re excited for what the future holds and have high confidence in Zolve&#8217;s future success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zolve also said it plans to aggressively expand its team. The startup’s headcount was just five earlier this year. It has since grown to 100, and now the startup is looking to hire 150 people across several roles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smart Eye, a supplier of driver monitoring systems for automakers, has agreed to acquire human behavior software company iMotions for $46.6 million just five months after it snapped up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/emotion-detection-software-startup-affectiva-acquired-for-73-5m/">emotion-detection software startup Affectiva</a>.</p>
<p>Smart Eye, a publicly traded Swedish company, said Tuesday this is a <a href="http://www.corp.smarteye.se/sv/press/pressmeddelanden/press-detail/?slug=smart-eye-ingar-avtal-att-forvarva-imotions-och-avser-att-anskaffa-kapital-genom-en-riktad-nyemission">cash-and-stock deal</a>. Smart Eye will provide $23.2 million (200 million Swedish kroner) in shares and the remaining amount will be paid in cash. iMotions, which employs 63 people, will operate as a standalone company within the Smart Eye Group. The company&#8217;s structure and management team will remain in place, according to Smart Eye.</p>
<p>The acquisition is notable because it signals growing consolidation within the driver monitoring systems segment, a trend that Smart Eye CEO and founder Martin Krantz confirmed in comments to TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224343" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We expect to see continued consolidation of DMS vendors due to increased demand for DMS and interior sensing, which is already ramping up amongst OEMs,&#8221; Krantz told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;With regulatory requirements in Europe — that are sure to follow in other regions of the world — we believe that nearly all global OEMs will procure their first or second generation DMS during the next couple of years. By joining forces with Affectiva, and now with iMotions, we are perfectly positioned for this development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attention on DMS has increased as automakers roll out so-called Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems. There are five levels of automation under standards created by SAE International. Level 2 means two primary functions &#8212; like adaptive cruise and lane keeping &#8212; are automated and still have a human driver in the loop at all times. Level 2 is not considered full self-driving. These are advanced driver assistance systems that require a human being to be engaged and ready to take over.</p>
<p>The DMS typically involves a camera that watches the driver to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention and not abusing or stretching the capabilities of the system. GM and Ford use DMS to allow for hands-free driving. For years, Tesla has not had a camera, or in the case of the Model 3 and Y, used it to monitor the attentiveness of drivers using its Autopilot system. Instead, Tesla has relied on a sensor to gauge whether the driver&#8217;s hands were on the wheel.</p>
<p>While Tesla now equips Model X and Model S vehicles produced in 2021 or later with a camera, the feature is currently only available for Model 3 and Y vehicles equipped with Tesla Vision. That has been a sore spot for safety advocates in the United States, who have called on Tesla to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/ntsb-chair-elon-musk-change-tesla-autopilot/">change the system design of Autopilot</a> to ensure it not being misused.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regulators in Europe have already weighed in on what vehicles must be equipped with, opening up an opportunity for Smart Eye and other competitors.</p>
<p>While Affectiva and iMotion are related, Smart Eye contends that they offer different and complementing capabilities that can be folded into its own AI-based eye-tracking technology. The two companies actually used to work together, according to Smart Eye.</p>
<p>Affectiva, which spun out of the MIT Media Lab in 2009, uses computer vision, speech analytics and software to study facial expressions and analyze human emotion and cognitive states. Meanwhile, iMotion developed a software layer that brings together data coming in from multiple sensors and provides analytics that can then be used to improve driver safety and the driving (or riding) experience.</p>
<p>Affectiva and iMotions&#8217; tech could help its new parent company establish market share in &#8220;interior sensing,&#8221; in which software and hardware are combined to monitor the entire cabin of a vehicle and deliver services in response to the occupant&#8217;s emotional state.</p>
