										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Most of the startups I give advice to about how to raise venture capital shouldn’t be raising venture capital,” an investor recently told me. While the idea that every startup isn’t venture-backable might run counter to the narrative to the barrage of funding news each week, I think it’s important to double click on the topic. Plus, it keeps coming up, off the record, on phone calls with investors!</p>
<p>As venture grows as an asset class, the access to capital has broadened from a dollar perspective, but I do think the difficulties that remain is an important dynamic to call out (and something no one talks about during an upmarket). Beyond the fact that only a small subset of startups truly can pull off scaling to the point of venture-level returns, it is still hard for even qualified founders to raise venture capital. Venture capital is still a heavily white, male-led industry, and as a result contains bias that disproportionately limits access for underrepresented founders.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/?tpcc=ECTW2020">So, you want to raise a Series A</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/understanding-how-fundraising-terms-can-affect-early-stage-startups/ ">Understanding how fundraising terms can affect early-stage startups</a></li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/how-to-build-the-right-team-for-a-billion-dollar-startup/">Building the right team for a billion-dollar startup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Eniac founding partner Hadley Harris applied this dynamic to the current market boom in a <a href=" https://twitter.com/Hadley/status/1380145821413482501">recent tweet:</a><em> A lot of people are misunderstanding this VC funding market. More money is flowing into the market but the increase is not evenly distributed. The market believes winners can be much bigger but not necessary that there will be more winners. It’s still very hard for most to raise a VC.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To say otherwise is to gaslight the early-stage or first-time founders that have spent months and months trying to raise their first institutional dollars and failed. So ask yourself: Seed rounds have indeed grown bigger, but for who? What comes at the cost of the $30 million seed round? Are the founders that can raise overnight from diverse backgrounds? Are investors backing first-time founders as much as they are backing second- or third-time entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>The answers might leave you debating about the boundaries, and limitations, of the upcoming hot-deal summer.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/y-combinator-demo-day-dispo-due-diligence/">the disconnect between due diligence and fundraising</a> right now. Now we&#8217;ve moved onto the disconnect, and bifurcation, within first-check fundraising itself. There is so much more we can get into about the fallacy of “democratization” in venture capital, from who gets to start a rolling fund to the lack of assurance within equity crowdfunding campaigns.</p>

<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we will talk about fintech politics, the Affirm model with a twist, and sneakers-as-a-service.</p>
<h2><strong>Ex-Coinbase talks politics </strong></h2>
<p>The inimitable <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo </a>has been dominating the fintech beat for us, covering everything from the latest<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/uruguayan-payments-startup-dlocal-quadruples-valuation-to-5b-with-150m-raise/"> Uruguayan unicorn</a> to Acorn’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/acorns-scoops-up-pillar-a-fintech-backed-by-kleiner-perkins/">scoop of a debt management startup.</a> But the story I want to focus on this week is her interview with ex-Coinbase counsel &amp; former Treasury official, Brian Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/">notoriously released</a> a memo last year denouncing political activism at work, calling it a distraction. In this exclusive interview, Brooks spoke about how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/blockchain-and-taking-the-politics-out-of-tech/">blockchain is the answer to financial inclusion</a>, and argued why politics needs to be taken out of tech.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We don’t want bank CEOs making those decisions for us as a society, in terms of who they choose to lend money to, or not. We need to take the politics out of tech. All of us do a lot of different things, and we have no idea on a given day, whether what we’re doing is popular with our neighbors or popular with our bank president or not. I don’t want the fact that I sometimes feel Republican to be a reason why my local bank president can deny me a mortgage.</em></p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>The Affirm for X model </strong></h2>
<p>While Affirm may have popularized the “buy now, pay later” model, the consumer-friendly business strategy still has room to be niched down into specific subsectors. I ran into one such startup when covering Plaid’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/plaid-accelerator-announces-inaugural-cohort-of-fintech-startups/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> inaugural cohort of startups in its accelerator program. </a></p>
<p>Here’s what to know: Walnut is a new seed-stage startup that is a point-of-sale loan company with a healthcare twist. Unlike Affirm, it doesn’t make money off of fees charged to consumers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our new podcast Found is now available, and the first episode features guest Iman Abuzeid, co-founder and CEO of Incredible Health. Abuzeid&#8217;s story of founding and building Incredible Health, a career platform for healthcare professionals focusing specifically on nurses, is all about a focused entrepreneur building a unique skill set, and acquiring the experience necessary to create a world-leading solution.</p>
<p>Abuzeid went to medical school and acquired her MD, but decided before residency to instead go get an MBA from Wharton, in order to pursue her dream of entrepreneurship, inspired by two generations of entrepreneurs in the family that preceded her. After eventually making her way to Silicon Valley and working in a couple of other startups in the healthcare space, Abuzeid took important lessons away from those experiences about what not to do when running your own company, and embarked on building her own with co-founder Rome Portlock, now the company&#8217;s CTO.</p>
<p>Incredible Health is tackling a huge challenge — the shortfall of availability of skilled nurses, and the lack of mature, sophisticated career resources to help those nurses in their professional life. COVID-19 threw those issues into stark relief, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/incredible-health-updates-its-healthcare-career-platform-to-help-nurse-hiring-cope-with-covid/"> Incredible Health adjusted its game plan to adapt to its users&#8217; needs</a>. Abuzeid tells us all about how she made those calls, and also how she <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/incredible-healths-hiring-platform-for-nurses-gets-15m-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">convinced venture investors to come along for the ride</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/"> poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>

<p>This week we&#8217;re looking into the upcoming Apple lawsuit with Epic Games over App Store fees, the soon-to-launch game changer that is App Tracking Transparency and Facebook&#8217;s latest attempt to take on Clubhouse, among other things.</p>
<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Epic vs Apple trial nears</h3>

<p>The Epic Games versus Apple trial is nearing launch. The trial, which begins May 3 and is expected to drag on for weeks, will see the Fortnite maker attempting to argue that Apple&#8217;s control over the App Store &#8212; and the 30% commission it requires on in-app purchases &#8212; represents anti-competitive behavior from a monopoly that requires regulation under antitrust law. Apple, meanwhile, feels confident that it can demonstrate its not a monopoly as it faces competition across the market, not just in its App Store. It will also likely point to the commission decreases it recently made in the wake of the increased regulatory scrutiny. Apple now takes a smaller 15% cut from developers making less than $1 million in revenues.</p>
<p>New filings this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/epic-cries-monopoly-as-apple-details-secret-project-liberty-effort-to-provoke-fortnite-ban/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">detail Epic&#8217;s long-term program &#8220;Project Liberty,</a>&#8221; which describes how Epic planned its antitrust battle by forcing app stores to reject Fortnite for circumventing their payment mechanisms. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute">A filing from Epic also references</a> comments by Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddie Cue, senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi and Apple Fellow Phil Schiller that talk about how Apple locks users into its ecosystem with its services, including iMessage. Epic also argues that Apple uses security as a &#8220;pretext&#8221; for its commissions &#8212; even as a recent series of allegations (and threat of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">lawsuit</a>) from app developer Kosta Eleftheriou have demonstrated that Apple&#8217;s vetting process is failing to stop massive scams. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/08/epic-accuses-apple-of-using-security-as-a-pretext/">Epic also says</a> that allowing Apple to serve customers&#8217; refund requests leads to fraud because it doesn&#8217;t have the same visibility into the developer&#8217;s content that the developer itself does.</p>

<h3>Apple shares more ATT details</h3>

<p>With the public release of iOS 14.5, which is expected soon, Apple will be shaking up the app economy with the launch of its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8h0btjq7">App Tracking Transparency framework</a>, or ATT. This requires iOS apps to begin prompting users for permission to track their users&#8217; activity, instead of just quietly doing so &#8212; generally without the user&#8217;s informed consent. Apple has said developers can explain in this prompt why they&#8217;re asking for this permission &#8212; for example, because they want to serve more personalized ads, perhaps. Tech giants like Facebook and Google, as well as many other ad-supported apps (and particularly social media apps), will be impacted by the change. Some have even gone so far as to try to find workarounds using non-IDFA methods, it&#8217;s been reported (IDFA being the current system that assigns a unique advertising ID to each device that is then tracked across the apps and websites a user visits). It was revealed <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/02/workaround-to-app-tracking-transparency/">last week</a> that Snapchat had investigated an IDFA alternative known as probabilistic matching, but claims it was just a &#8220;test.&#8221; Meanwhile, China&#8217;s largest tech companies &#8212; including Baidu, Tencent and ByteDance &#8212; <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snapchat-risks-apples-wrath-attempts-053334646.html">have been exploring</a> a state-backed IDFA alternative CAID.</p>
<p>This week, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details">made it clear</a> that &#8220;no tracking&#8221; without permission means just that. It says that if a user opts out of any IDFA-tracking via the pop-up, that means the developer doesn&#8217;t have permission to track using any other sort of identifiers either &#8212; like hashed email addresses or whatever other workaround developers come up with.</p>
<h3>Facebook tries another Clubhouse rival</h3>

<p>Facebook’s internal R&amp;D group, NPE Team, this week launched its latest experiment, Hotline, into public beta testing. The web-based application could be described as a mashup of Instagram Live and Clubhouse, as it allows creators to speak to an audience who can then ask questions through either text or audio. However, unlike Clubhouse, creators can opt to turn their cameras on for the event, instead of being audio-only. Currently, users sign in with Twitter and then verify their phone number to authenticate with the app. They can then type in their question to submit it to the speaker, who pulls them &#8220;on stage&#8221; to discuss. For now, the participants were audio-only and represented by a profile icon, but settings suggest that Hotline will test video for users in the future.</p>
<p>As the questions are asked, users can react with emoji, including clapping hands, fire, heart, laughter, surprise and thumbs up. And most importantly, unlike Clubhouse, Hotline events are recorded. Creators get both an audio and video recording that they could edit and upload elsewhere, including on other social networks. Because of its use of video, upvoted questions and recording, the app has a different vibe than Clubhouse &#8212; it feels more like a virtual event than a more casual space. Facebook is catering to this audience, too, by seeking out creators who are focused on doling out professional advice, it says.</p>
<p>Of note, Hotline is being led by Eric Hazzard, who joined Facebook when it acquired his app tbh, a positivity-focused Q&amp;A app.</p>
<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>
<p><strong>Still more betas</strong>. Apple this week <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/07/apple-issues-seventh-betas-for-ios-145-ipados-145-watchos-74">released its seventh betas</a> for iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5 and other platforms, including Apple TV and Apple Watch &#8212; iOS 14.5 brings the rollout of App Tracking Transparency, which is why Apple is probably taking its time with this one.</p>
<p><strong>iOS 14 adoption has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/06/ios-14-adoption-surpasses-90-according-to-mixpanel/">now surpassed 90%</a></strong> according to data from Mixpanel. In December, 81% of phones were running iOS 14, now 90.45% are. Another 5.07% of users are running iOS 13, while 4.48% are running iOS 12 or older versions.</p>
<p><strong>Apple has been spotted testing tags in the App Store</strong> that will help guide users to more precise search results. The test, first reported by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/app-store-search-tags/">MacRumors</a>, had users encounter tags at the top of App Store search results when searching for popular terms like &#8220;photos&#8221; or &#8220;wallpaper,&#8221; that could help narrow results. Some users were running the iOS 14.5 beta when they saw tags, but others were not. It&#8217;s unclear if or when tags will launch to the wider public.</p>

The company has still not launched its own AirTags, a lost-item finder similar to Tile. Instead, it&#8217;s smartly positioning the Find My app as a platform anyone can plug into, in order to assuage anti-competitive concerns. The first items that will plug into Find My include VanMoof’s S3 and X3 e-bikes, Belkin’s SoundForm Freedom True Wireless Earbuds and the Chipolo ONE Spot tracker (a Tile rival).</p>

<p>However, one big name is notably missing from the lineup, and that&#8217;s AirTags&#8217; biggest competitor, Tile itself. Tile doesn&#8217;t want to hand over the direct customer relationship it has by way of its Tile app just to be included in Find My. And some have suggested Apple is propping up the Chipolo tracker to counter any arguments from Tile that it&#8217;s being anti-competitive with the launch of AirTags when they finally arrive.</p>

<p><strong>Apple updated its App Store Connect and Apple Music for Artists app icons</strong> to look more like the design choices used on macOS Big Sur. That&#8217;s <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/07/revamped-icons-hint-at-ios-15-app-redesign">leading to speculation</a> that iOS 15 could also adopt the look of Big Sur when it comes to design.</p>

<p><strong>Apple details its App Store takedowns in new transparency report.</strong> Apple&#8217;s latest transparency report offers information about app takedowns due to requests from government authorities due to suspected violations of local laws. Apple says it complies with these requests where it&#8217;s legally required to do so. These requests, however, are not focused on Apple&#8217;s own editorial guidelines, which prohibit content that Apple itself chooses not to host.</p>

<h3>Platforms: Google</h3>
<p><strong>The new Google Play Store design arrives, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-google-play-store-ui-removes-hamburger-menu">killing off the hamburger menu</a> </strong>for good. The design is rolling out to Android devices. An in-app message tells you that those menu items have been moved to your profile icon, which, when tapped, brings up a condensed menu. The Settings menu was also updated. Some have complained the changes are making menu items and options harder to find. The Play Store hadn&#8217;t been updated significantly since 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Google announced <a href="https://blog.google/products/admob/advancing-mobile-app-inventory-quality-app-reviews/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29">a new app review process across AdMob and Ad Manager</a> </strong>which will evaluate a mobile app&#8217;s inventory quality before allowing unrestricted ad serving. The process will give publishers feedback on their apps&#8217; approval status so they can resolve issues that could lead to policy violations. Google says the new app reviews are being rolled out gradually in 2021 with two features: app readiness and app claiming. The former will require publishers to link apps they want to monetize with one supported app store, so their app can then be reviewed. The process will check the app source, publisher&#8217;s ownership and policy compliance. App Claiming will provide a list of apps that are being monetized with their ad code but aren&#8217;t yet on their AdMob or Ad Manager account.</p>

<p>This relatively new AR app lets you add AR to anything &#8212; a textbook, a magazine cover, a piece of paper, a photo or any other flat real-world object. To use Halo AR, you first select the object and snap a photo, then choose which photo, video or 3D model you want to overlay on top of it. Teachers can use the app to &#8220;tag&#8221; their course materials with AR links of sorts to immersive content or videos. Or you could use it for fun to create a scavenger hunt in the house for the kids. The app is a free download in the Education category on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/halo-ar-add-ar-to-anything/id1534359793">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lightup.lens&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese regulators have hit Alibaba with a record fine of 18 billion yuan (about $2.75 billion) for violating anti-monopoly rules as the country seeks to rein in the power of its largest internet conglomerates.</p>
<p>In November, China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">proposed sweeping antitrust regulations </a>targeting its interent economy. In late December, the State Administration for Market Regulation said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba</a>, weeks after the authorities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">called off the initial public offering</a> of Ant Group, the financial affiliate of Alibaba.</p>
<p>SAMR, the country&#8217;s top market regulator, said on Saturday it had determined that Alibaba had been &#8220;abusing market dominance&#8221; since 2015 by forcing its Chinese merchants to sell exclusively on one e-commerce platform instead of letting them choose freely among different services, such as Pinduoduo and JD.com. Vendors are often pressured to side with Alibaba to take advantage of its enormous user base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since late 2020, a clutch of internet giants including Tencent and Alibaba have been hit with various fines for violating anti-competition practices, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/china-literature-alibaba-fined/">failing to clear past acquisitions with regulators</a>. The meager sums of these penalties were symbolic at best compared to the benefits the tech firms reap from their market concentration. No companies have been told to break up their empires and users still have to hop between different super-apps that block each other off.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, however, there are signs that China&#8217;s antitrust authorities are getting more serious. The latest fine on Alibaba is equivalent to 4% of the company&#8217;s revenue generated in the calendar year of 2019 in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we received the Administrative Penalty Decision issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China,&#8221; Alibaba said in a statement. &#8220;We accept the penalty with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination. To serve our responsibility to society, we will operate in accordance with the law with utmost diligence, continue to strengthen our compliance systems and build on growth through innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thick walls that tech companies build against each other are starting to break down, too. Alibaba has submitted an application to have its shopping deals app run on WeChat&#8217;s mini program platform, Wang Hai, an Alibaba executive, recently confirmed.</p>
<p>For years, Alibaba services have been absent from Tencent&#8217;s sprawling lite app ecosystem, which now features millions of third-party services. Vice versa, WeChat is notably missing from Alibaba&#8217;s online marketplaces as a payment method. If approved, the WeChat-powered Alibaba mini app would break with precedent of the pair&#8217;s long stand-off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Practically every film production these days needs some kind of visual effects work, but independent creators often lack the cash or expertise to get that top-shelf CG. <a href="https://www.wonderdynamics.com/">Wonder Dynamics</a>, founded by VFX engineer Nikola Todorovic and actor Tye Sheridan, aims to use AI to make some of these processes more accessible for filmmakers with budgets on the tight side, and they&#8217;ve just raised $2.5 million to make it happen.</p>
<p>The company has its origins in 2017, after Sheridan and Todorovic met on the set of Rodrigo Garcia&#8217;s film <em>Last Days in the Desert</em>. They seem to have both felt that the opportunity was there to democratize the tools that they had access to in big studio films.</p>
<p>Wonder Dynamics is very secretive about what exactly its tools do. <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/vfx-startup-wonder-dynamics-2-5-million-seed-funding-nikola-todorovic-tye-sheridan-steven-spielberg-joe-russo-1234730142/">Deadline&#8217;s Mike Fleming Jr</a> saw a limited demo and said he &#8220;could see where it will be of value in the area of world creation at modest budgets. The process can be done quickly and at a fraction of a traditional cost structure,&#8221; though that leaves us little closer than we started.</p>
<p>Sheridan and Todorovic (who jointly answered questions I sent over) described the system, called Wallace Pro, as taking over some of the grunt work of certain classes of VFX rather than a finishing touch or specific effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building an AI platform that will significantly speed up both the production and post-production process for content involving CG characters and digital worlds. The goal of the platform is to reduce the costs associated with these productions by automating the &#8216;objective&#8217; part of the process, leaving the artists with the creative, &#8216;subjective&#8217; work,&#8221; they said. &#8220;By doing this, we hope to create more opportunities and empower filmmakers with visions exceeding their budget. Without saying too much, it can be applied to all three stages of filmmaking (pre-production, production and post-production), depending on the specific need of the artist.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="odCc0HdZBj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/ang-lee-making-of-gemini-man/">Director Ang Lee explains why he built a digital Will Smith in &#8216;Gemini Man&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Director Ang Lee explains why he built a digital Will Smith in &#8216;Gemini Man&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/ang-lee-making-of-gemini-man/embed/#?secret=odCc0HdZBj" data-secret="odCc0HdZBj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>From this we can take that it&#8217;s an improvement to the workflow, reducing the time it takes to achieve some widely used effects, and therefore the money that needs to be set aside for them. To be clear this is distinct from another, more specific product being developed by Wonder Dynamics to create virtual interactive characters as part of the film production process — an early application of the company&#8217;s tools, no doubt.</p>
<p>The tech has been in some small scale tests, but the plan is to put it to work in a feature entering production later this year. &#8220;Before we release the tech to the public, we want to be very selective with the first filmmakers who use the technology to make sure the films are being produced at a high level,&#8221; they said. First impressions do matter.</p>
<p>The $2.5M seed round was led by Founders Fund, Cyan Banister, the Realize Tech Fund, Capital Factory, MaC Venture Capital, and Robert Schwab. &#8220;Because we are at the intersection of technology and film, we really wanted to surround ourselves with investment partners who understand how much the two industries will depend on each other in the future,&#8221; Sheridan and Todorovic said. &#8220;We were extremely fortunate to get MaC Venture Capital and Realize Tech Fund alongside FF. Both funds have a unique combination of Silicon Valley and Hollywood veterans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wonder Dynamics will use the money to, as you might expect, scale its engineering and VFX teams to further develop and expand the product&#8230; whatever it is.</p>
<p>With their advisory board, it would be hard to make a mistake without someone calling them on it. &#8220;We’re extremely lucky to have some of the most brilliant minds from both the AI and film space,&#8221; they said, and that&#8217;s no exaggeration. Right now the lineup includes Steven Spielberg and Joe Russo (&#8220;obviously geniuses when it comes to film production and innovation&#8221;), UC Berkeley and Google&#8217;s Angjoo Kanazawa and MIT&#8217;s Antonio Torralba (longtime AI researchers in robotics and autonomy), and numerous others in film and finance who &#8220;offer us a wealth of knowledge when we’re trying to figure out how to move the company forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>AI is deeply integrated into many tech companies and enterprise stacks, making it a solid moneymaker in that industry, but it is still something of a fringe concept in the more creator-driven film and TV world. Yet hybrid production techniques like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/ilm-shows-off-the-new-stagecraft-led-wall-used-for-season-2-of-the-mandalorian/">ILM&#8217;s StageCraft</a>, used to film <em>The Mandalorian</em>, are showing how techniques traditionally used for 3D modeling and game creation can be applied safely to film production — sometimes even live on camera. AI is increasingly that part of the world, as pioneers like Nvidia and Adobe have shown, and it seems inevitable that it should come to film — though in exactly what form it&#8217;s hard to say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sometimes you’ve just got to confirm an unannounced product to put the rumors to bed, I guess. That was Google’s strategy this afternoon, following earlier rumors <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-5g-limited-release-us-japan">from Android Central</a> that a chip shortage had put the kibosh on the mid-budget phone.</p>
<p>In a comment to TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson noted, “Pixel 5a 5G is not cancelled. It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.”</p>
<p>That time frame would put the device’s arrival around late-summer, meaning it won’t arrive in time for Google I/O in May, as some speculated. Interestingly, the company appears to be limiting the device&#8217;s availability to two countries &#8212; at least at launch. That could, perhaps, be due to earlier-reported component shortages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled">The Verge notes</a>, the company hasn’t been particularly precious when it comes to product announcements. The company took a similar approach ahead of the release of the Pixel. Either way, this isn’t exactly the standard big company approach to rumor denial, which is to either not answer or otherwise deflect.</p>
<p>Google may well be on edge about its Pixel line these days. The phone line hasn’t exactly taken the mobile world be storm, resulting in longstanding rumors that the company is looking to shake things up. That, in part, has seemingly been confirmed by some fairly high-profile exits.</p>
<p>Still, even while there have been issues on the premium side, the company’s budget &#8220;a&#8221; line has helped buoy its overall numbers. No word yet on specific specs, but the handset is not expected to be a radical departure from its predecessor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few companies have done better than Scale at spotting a need in the AI gold rush early on and filling that gap. The startup rightly identified that one of the tasks most important to building effective AI at scale — the laborious exercise of tagging data sets to make them usable in properly training new AI agents — was one that companies focused on that area of tech would also be most willing to outsource. CEO and co-founder Alex Wang credits their success since founding, which includes raising over $277 million and achieving break-even status in terms of revenue, to early support from investors including Accel&#8217;s Dan Levine.</p>
<p>Accel haș participated in four of Scale&#8217;s financing rounds, which is all of them unless you include the funding from YC the company secured as part of a cohort in 2016. In fact, Levine wrote one of the company&#8217;s very first checks. So on this past week&#8217;s episode of Extra Crunch Live, we spoke with Levine and Wang about how that first deal came together, and what their working relationship has been like in the years since.</p>
<p>Scale&#8217;s story starts with a pivot, and with a bit of rule-breaking, too — Wang went off the typical YC book by speaking to investors prior to demo day when Levine cold-emailed him after seeing Scale on Product Hunt. The Product Hunt spot wasn&#8217;t planned, either — Wang was as surprised to see his company there as anyone else. But Levine saw the kernel of something with huge potential, and despite being a relative unknown in VC at the time, didn&#8217;t want to let the opportunity pass him, or Wang, by.</p>
<p>Both Wang and Levine were also able to provide some great feedback on decks submitted to our regular Pitch Deck Teardown segment, despite the fact that Levine actually never saw a pitch deck from Wang before investing (more on that later). If you&#8217;d like your pitch deck reviewed by experienced founders and investors on a future episode, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">you can submit your deck here</a>.</p>
<h2>Knowing when to bend the rules</h2>
<p>As mentioned, Levine and Accel&#8217;s initial investment in Scale came from a cold email sent after the company appeared on Product Hunt. Wang said the team had just put out an early version of Scale, and then noticed that it was up on Product Hunt — it was submitted by someone else. The community response was encouraging, and it also led to Levine reaching out via email.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the side effects of that, one of the outcomes, was that we got this cold email from Dan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We really knew nothing about Dan until his cold email. So like many great stories that started with a bold, cold email. And we were pretty stressed about it at the time, because in YC, they tell you pretty definitively, &#8216;Hey, don&#8217;t talk to a VC during the batch,&#8217; and we were squarely in the middle of the batch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang and the team were so nervous that they even considered &#8220;ghosting&#8221; Dan despite his obvious interest and the prestige of Accel as an investment firm. In the end, they decided to &#8220;go rogue&#8221; and respond, which led to a meeting at the Accel offices in Palo Alto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last few days, we&#8217;ve published several articles recapping panels from last week&#8217;s TechCrunch Early Stage virtual conference.</p>
<p>Each story is based on an interview with a founder or investor who addressed some of the most common startup dilemmas. Predictably, they&#8217;re mostly focused on the <strong><em>how</em></strong> and <strong><em>why:</em></strong></p>
<p><i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/how-to-get-into-a-startup-accelerator/">How do I get into an accelerator?</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/building-and-leading-an-early-stage-sales-team-with-zoom-cro-ryan-azus/">When should I hire a sales team?</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/four-strategies-for-getting-attention-from-investors/">What&#8217;s the best way to earn attention from investors?</a></i></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch reporter Natasha Mascarenhas interviewed Kleiner Perkins partner Bucky Moore to get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/">sector-agnostic advice for founders who are ready to raise a Series A</a>.</p>
<p>Their conversation isn&#8217;t a rehash of basic best practices — Moore says the pandemic has fundamentally changed the way he does business: &#8220;I actually believe that first meetings over Zoom are here to stay; I think it&#8217;s far more efficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the eventual return of live TechCrunch events, but each Early Stage recap includes video and a complete transcript. As ever, full articles are available for Extra Crunch members.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading — I hope you have a fantastic weekend.</p>

<p>Have you ever bought a pig in a poke?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a saying from medieval times: A farmer traveling on an unfamiliar road agrees to buy a baby pig in a bag from a passing stranger. Unfortunately, when the farmer gets back to their hut and opens the sack, there&#8217;s a kitten inside.</p>
<p>The risk of getting stuck with a counterfeit item when buying online is real, especially when it comes to sneakers, jewelry and other designer products. That&#8217;s why online marketplace StockX created a rigorous product verification and authentication process.</p>
<p>To date, its users have conducted more than 10 million transactions for sneakers, handbags, streetwear, watches and other high-end items that are often produced in limited quantities.</p>
<p>StockX&#8217;s prices are regulated and all transactional data is transparent, factors that have combined to help the platform reach a $2.8 billion valuation.</p>
<p>In a four-part series that dropped this week, Extra Crunch analyzes this &#8220;foundational new category of market&#8221; that began as a hobbyist&#8217;s sneaker price chart.</p>

<p>It appears that the slowdown in tech debuts is not a complete freeze; despite concerning news regarding the IPO pipeline, some deals are chugging ahead.</p>
<p>Alkami Technology joins a list that includes Coinbase’s impending direct listing and Robinhood’s expected IPO.</p>
<p>Texas-based Alkami Technology is a software company that delivers its product to banks via the cloud, so it’s not a legacy player scraping together an IPO during boom times.</p>

<p>Last year could well have been the dawn of alternative protein in China. More than 10 startups raised capital to make plant-based protein for a country with increasing meat demand. Of these, Starfield, Hey Maet, Vesta and Haofood have been around for about a year; ZhenMeat was founded three years ago; and Green Monday is a nine-year-old Hong Kong firm pushing into mainland China.</p>
<p>The competition intensified further last year when American incumbents Beyond Meat and Eat Just entered China.</p>
<p>Although some investors worry the sudden boom of meat-substitute startups could turn into a bubble, others believe the market is far from saturated.</p>

<p>For those who follow the space, LG will be remembered fondly as a smartphone trailblazer. For well over a decade, the company was a major player in the Android category and a driving force behind a number of innovations that have since become standard.</p>
<p>LG continued pushing envelopes — albeit to mixed effect. But in the end, the company just couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p>This week, the South Korean electronics giant announced it will be getting out of the “incredibly competitive” category, choosing instead to focus on its myriad other departments.</p>

<h2>Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit</h2>

<p>Electric cars and trucks seem to have everything going for them: They don’t produce tailpipe emissions, they’re quieter than their fossil-fuel-powered counterparts and the underlying architecture allows for roomier and often sleeker designs.</p>
<p>But the humble lithium-ion battery powering these cars and trucks leads a difficult life. Irregular charging and discharge rates, intense temperatures and many partial charge cycles cause these batteries to degrade in the first five to eight years of use, and, eventually, they end up in a recycling facility.</p>
<p>Instead of sending batteries straight to recycling for raw material recovery — and leaving unrealized value on the table — startups and automakers are finding ways to reuse batteries as part of a small and growing market.</p>

<p>Solivan has ample experience on both sides of the fence, as she founded TaskRabbit and led it to exit through an acquisition by Ikea in 2017. She shared a list of 10 things to avoid in total, but here are some highlights of what to watch out for.</p>

<p>Eghosa Omoigui, the founder and managing general partner of EchoVC Partners, has helped entrepreneurs navigate the first steps of starting a company and laying the right foundation early on.</p>
<p>Omoigui advocates for founders to develop their own All-22 tape — a tool used by professional football coaches that allows the viewer to see all 22 players on the field at the same time. It improves a coach’s line of sight, and, most importantly, helps avoid missing a critical motion or player.</p>
<p>The concept of this tool can — and should — be applied in the startup world as well, Omoigui said during the virtual TC Early Stage event. He explained what it means to have an All-22 tape and the steps founders should take to develop a skill set that will allow them to see and understand the playbook from all sides.</p>

<p>This year at Early Stage, TechCrunch spoke with Zoom Chief Revenue Officer Ryan Azus about building an early-stage sales team.</p>
<p>Azus is perhaps best known for leading the video-calling giant’s income arm during COVID-19, but his experience building RingCentral’s North American sales organization from the ground up made him the perfect guest to chat with about building an early-stage sales team.</p>
<p>We asked him about when founders should step aside from leading their startup’s sales org, how to build a working sales culture, hiring diversely, how to pick customer segments and how to build a playbook.</p>

<p>Should you try to get your company into an accelerator? How far along should your idea and your team be before applying? When it is time to apply, how do you make your application stand out from hundreds or thousands of others? How fancy do you need to get with the application video?</p>
<p>For answers, we spoke with Neal Sáles-Griffin, managing director of Techstars Chicago and an adjunct professor at Northwestern University. He’s got an incredible wealth of knowledge about all things startups.</p>

<p>Belt has been involved in a number of key Silicon Valley moves, including EV company Proterra’s recent decision to go public via SPAC, as well as IPOs for Bill.com and Facebook. Here, she discusses key concepts like equity and the right of first refusal, and the role they play in the early stages of startup funding.</p>

<p>Product-led growth is all the rage in the Valley these days, and we had two leading thinkers discuss how to incorporate it into a startup at TechCrunch Early Stage 2021.</p>
<p>Tope Awotona is the CEO and founder of Calendly, which bootstrapped for much of its existence before raising $350 million at a $3 billion valuation from OpenView and Iconiq. And on the other side of that table (and this interview) sat Blake Bartlett, a partner at OpenView who has been leading enterprise deals based around the principles of efficient growth.</p>
<p>The two talked about bootstrapping and product-led growth, expanding internationally, when to bootstrap and when to fundraise, and how VCs approach a profitable company (carefully, and with a big stick). Oh, and how to spend $350 million.</p>

<p>Being a successful early-stage investor is about a lot more than simply identifying trends; a successful VC needs to think several steps ahead. For MaC Venture Capital founder Marlon Nichols, it’s an ability that’s helped him spot big names like Gimlet Media, MongoDB, Thrive Market, PlayVS, Fair, LISNR, Mayvenn, Blavity and Wonderschool early on.</p>
<p>Nichols joined us on TechCrunch Early Stage to discuss his strategies for early-stage investing and how those lessons can translate into a successful launch for budding entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Viewed from the outside, board selection and corporate governance can seem like a bit of a black box — particularly at a startup.</p>
<p>Generation Investment Management partner Dave Easton spoke at TechCrunch Early Stage about how to build a board as a founder, and, specifically, how to build a board you can live with. Easton’s experience serving on boards as both a full member and as an observer helped peel back the curtain on the murky topic of good governance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The planet-loving folks at the <a href="https://www.soalliance.org">Sustainable Ocean Alliance</a> started an accelerator a couple years back focusing on very early-stage companies, but this year they&#8217;re expanding the program to accept those that have already closed their first round. The mix of experimental and (comparatively) proven approaches may help diversify the accelerator&#8217;s growing network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year, amidst the onset of a global pandemic and mounting urgency related to solving the ocean’s greatest challenges, we received unprecedented demand for the <a href="https://www.soalliance.org/ocean-solutions-accelerator/">Ocean Solutions Accelerator,</a>&#8221; said the accelerator&#8217;s co-founder, Craig Dudenhoeffer. &#8220;It became clear to us that now more than ever, ocean tech startups need powerful community support, mentorship and access to those unique opportunities that truly propel their businesses. We decided to double our efforts and run two accelerator cohorts in 2021 in order to support 21 incredible innovators.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/ocean-solutions-accelerators-third-wave-tackles-a-new-set-of-aquatic-challenges/">Last year&#8217;s cohort</a> included companies creating robotic fish, kelp-based foods, artificial reefs, aquaculture animal feed and other interesting and potentially breakthrough products. But one thing they all have in common with each other and those from previous years is they are nearly all <em>very</em> early stage.</p>

<p>Having a prototype and taking on a big problem or market is a great start, but it&#8217;s also where a lot of startups wash out. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/coral-vita-cultivates-2m-seed-to-take-its-reef-restoration-mission-global/">Coral Vita</a> have powered through repeated disasters (in their case hurricanes and of course the pandemic) to raise money and move toward scaling up.</p>
<p>But others in the sadly undervalued conservation space still have a long road ahead before VCs think it&#8217;s worth taking a risk on them. Few check writers will see the problems and potential solutions up close and personal and make a personal connection with the driven and occasionally idealistic young founders, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/in-the-accelerator-over-the-sea/">those that I saw do that in Alaska were convinced</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WzIA6hn81g"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/in-the-accelerator-over-the-sea/">In the Accelerator over the Sea</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This year the accelerator will have two sequential cohorts, an early-stage one in June for pre-seed companies and another in September for those that have raised a seed or A round and have &#8220;a strong MVP.&#8221; Applications for both are open until April 12th, with 21 spots available. That&#8217;s Monday, so better get to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In expanding to two accelerator programs this year, we&#8217;re now able to provide highly curated content and tailored support to serve our entrepreneurs and meet them exactly where they&#8217;re at in their unique journeys to addressing our most critical ocean challenges,&#8221; said Dudenhoeffer.</p>
<p>While the organization is still small and the accelerator a relatively straightforward affair, the space that they are in is expanding and gaining credit among investors. Renewed attention and funding on climate change, ecological stewardship and alternative energy sources from the new Biden administration change the equations for startups and services in related industries; all of a sudden an idea that seemed wild a couple years ago makes perfect sense. With luck that means a bit of wind in the sails of entrepreneurs trying to save the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Efforts to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama appear to have failed, Facebook takes down fake review groups and a monkey plays Pong with its brain. This is your Daily Crunch for April 9, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Amazon beats back union push</strong></p>
<p>Union organizers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/">lost a much-publicized election</a> at Amazon&#8217;s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse, with more than half of the 3,215 ballots cast ultimately voting against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,&#8221; the company said in a blog post. &#8220;Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us. And Amazon didn’t win—our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum suggested that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/rwdsu-head-says-rerun-election-very-likely-following-amazon-union-vote-loss/">there will &#8220;very likely&#8221; be a rerun election</a>, and his organization is demanding &#8220;a comprehensive investigation over Amazon’s behavior in corrupting this election.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ureeka founder Melissa Bradley explains how to prepare for a virtual pitch, allocate time, how to close meetings with a clear list of action items, and what to avoid.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Melissa Bradley wears many hats. She&#8217;s the co-founder of a startup called Ureeka, an investor at 1863 Ventures, and a professor at Georgetown&#8217;s business school. So it&#8217;s not an understatement to say that she understands the fundraising process from every angle. And moreover, she has both invested and fundraised for her own startup during this last year, where the landscape has shifted drastically. At TechCrunch Early Stage, she led a session on how to nail your virtual pitch meeting.</p>
<p>Bradley covered how to allocate your time during the meeting, how to prepare, how to close out the meetings with a clear list of action items, and what to avoid.</p>
<p>You can watch the session or check out the full transcript below, but I&#8217;ve also pulled out a few highlights from the talk just for you.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Conversation &gt; Pitching</h2>
<p>One of the greatest shifts in the pitch landscape during the pandemic was the nature of meetings themselves. Because investors and founders can take 30 meetings a day from the comfort of their home, it means that conversation has been prioritized over presentation. Adding to the need for conversation is the fact that investors aren&#8217;t &#8216;getting to know you&#8217; IRL as they would in the past, and so how you interact (not just the content of your pitch) is critically important.</p>
<p>Bradley explained that planning for extra time to answer questions and go deep on strategy is more important now than ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now is the time to really have a conversation and deeply engage the investor in your story and your vision. You want to be conversational in nature, but still formal in tone. So you want to be respectful; you want to avoid jargon; you want to make sure it&#8217;s clear what you&#8217;re talking about. But it&#8217;s really much more of a two-way conversation than we&#8217;ve probably seen before. I think again, pace yourself, be really clear in advance how much time you have. One-third of the time should be spent on your pitch, and the other two-thirds, you should be prepared to field questions and really have that conversation. Pace yourself. Don&#8217;t rush through. If you only have 30 minutes, it&#8217;s probably not the best time to do a demo. You might want to follow up with a recorded demo or make an offer to do a demo afterwards. <em><strong>(Timestamp &#8211; 6:03)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A batch of job listings along with some <a class="c-link" href="https://twitter.com/Shared_MM/status/1380118058149277696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://twitter.com/Shared_MM/status/1380118058149277696" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Twitter whisperings</a> suggests that scooter companies such as Lime and Superpedestrian are gearing up to operate in London and New York City — two of the last remaining frontiers of shared-scooter services.</p>
<p>A review of job listings, company websites and LinkedIn shows that Lime and Dott are preparing to launch in London, while Lime, Superpedestrian and maybe even Spin are getting ready for New York. While the job posts don&#8217;t provide definitive proof that these companies have been awarded these coveted permits, it does identify which companies believe they will win.</p>
<p><a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/e-scooter-firms-get-the-green-light-to-start-trials-of-up-to-one-year-on-uk-streets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/e-scooter-firms-get-the-green-light-to-start-trials-of-up-to-one-year-on-uk-streets/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">London&#8217;s Department for Transport</a> and the NYC City Council approved their respective e-scooter pilots in the summer of 2020 as city dwellers sought socially distanced modes of travel. London’s pilot should have begun at the <a class="c-link" href="https://cities-today.com/london-set-for-uks-largest-e-scooter-trials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://cities-today.com/london-set-for-uks-largest-e-scooter-trials/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">start of 2021</a>, and <a class="c-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/the-scooter-battle-for-new-york-city-is-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/the-scooter-battle-for-new-york-city-is-on/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">NYC’s was originally meant to launch by March 1</a>, but neither city has even named which companies will be awarded concessions yet. Sources familiar with the dealings say London is holding up the announcement until after the mayoral race on May 6. The NYC Department of Transportation declined to comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h3><b>Dott, Tier and Lime for London?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been speculation that Dott, Lime and maybe Tier will be sharing the streets of London once the pilot takes off. Information on Dott’s and Lime’s websites, LinkedIn profiles and hiring pages show that they&#8217;re hiring for positions in the city. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Sources in the industry told TechCrunch that Tier had a London-focused job posting listed on its page that has since been taken down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dott, which doesn’t already appear to have a footprint in the United Kingdom, is hiring a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/dott/1e6c32b0-9d6d-48fc-b3f4-a35450badef5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.-based operations manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “set up operations from scratch within the U.K.” They’re also hiring a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/dott/78ab7100-968b-425e-81c7-9db30ac85f27"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public policy manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be the “voice for the Dott U.K. market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dott&#8217;s website, a map showing service areas shows a little yellow flag over London. Clicking on the flag leads to a 404 “page not found” error page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime, a mobility company that appears to be swiftly taking over the world, already has a presence in London in the form of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/lime-puts-jump-bikes-back-on-london-streets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jump e-bikes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which made an appearance last summer. New job postings on LinkedIn suggests they&#8217;re preparing to expand. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ty0KRtyGNE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/lime-puts-jump-bikes-back-on-london-streets/">Lime puts Jump bikes back on London streets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lime puts Jump bikes back on London streets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/lime-puts-jump-bikes-back-on-london-streets/embed/#?secret=ty0KRtyGNE" data-secret="ty0KRtyGNE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s LinkedIn page reveals a call for a London-based </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2468099289/?refId=%2F4D1DeGAM%2By8FBOAHtY83w%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=Iu46GoQeCBTbKH0u65NHpg%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose responsibilities include building and implementing “the operational infrastructure to ensure market growth in the United Kingdom.” That gig was posted a week ago and they’re actively recruiting for it on LinkedIn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About a month ago, Lime also posted a London-based </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2364137536/?refId=%2F4D1DeGAM%2By8FBOAHtY83w%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=HKFaSrR3Lu9Vxr37yD23Yg%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations manager </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">role, for which it appears to still be recruiting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voi might also still be in the running based on its job postings on LinkedIn. On Thursday, the company added a call for an </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2495249822/?refId=iPEgNhvu8RWSo83rrvagLw%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=HH3H%2Bk7GnAOTXkBp9gKFeQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ambassador supervisor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a six-month position in London. It seems to be an on-the-ground sort of role, and the temporary nature of it could have something to do with London’s year-long pilot. It’s also possible the company is just looking for someone in a central city to manage the other U.K. cities where Voi operates.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird has already been in London’s Olympic Park since the summer, and it </span><a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/olympic-park-legalization-how-bird-brought-e-scooters-to-uk/#:~:text=You%20can%20ride%20Bird's%20e,of%20lobbying%20for%20legislative%20change"><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively lobbied for a change in London’s legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around scooters riding on roads or pavements. This presence could explain why Bird’s operating map highlights London, but to make matters more confusing, the company is hiring an </span><a href="https://www.bird.co/careers/?gh_jid=4258750003"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations associate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ostensibly handle London city operations and general U.K. operations. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superpedestrian, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has four new job posts up between its website and LinkedIn. On the site, there’s a call for a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/superpedestrian/88228461-304b-4ac0-9d84-b7eb0990b36d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief of staff who is ideally based in </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC to support the CEO. Also listed is a </span><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/superpedestrian/9b94e33e-8fa6-48cc-afe6-fca8d3d933f2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> position; duties include “being responsible for the growth and success of our scooter share in New York and New Jersey.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On LinkedIn, Superpedestrian has posted two positions based in NYC. The first, posted a week ago, is an </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2483019826/?refId=b4Z7U61diRhPUxiz9vlnaA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=GDZHe%2FMrZ1Uti7TakXIkQw%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations associate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will handle things like scooter charging, safety inspections, deployment of scooters and scooter repair and assembly. The second is a </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2416394401/?refId=b4Z7U61diRhPUxiz9vlnaA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=aqan4Jcv6XtRSJ9TclTeUQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scooter mechanic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, posted a month ago, but to be fair the post does include the caveat: “If we are awarded the privilege of operating in NYC…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin also posted (about a week ago) an </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2473930979/?refId=LILWlsW2LY6y82OAPBSdAQ%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=TLwut3hpFmcF77q54xx82A%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based in New York. The employee hired for the position will be tasked with “Spin’s day-to-day operations, managing drivers and mechanics and building a highly efficient operations team.” It’s not precisely indicative of the Ford-owned company winning NYC, but the job does appear to be involved with on-the-ground tasks. The post also hints that the new hire would be leading the build-out and deployment of Spin’s vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a huge presence in Europe but absolutely none in the United States as of yet, Voi has been hoping NYC would be its entry into the country. The company hasn’t posted any NYC-specific job ads, but its job board features a locations dropdown menu that includes NYC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Bird is adding to the mess of guesses with two LinkedIn job posts based in New York. The </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2457588069/?refId=0S0DwtAk2i1eLYXaYYAQJA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=KADK0VOiB%2F6YYHXJMc4yKQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">general manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> position, posted four weeks ago but still actively recruiting, appears to require someone to be pretty locally involved. The </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2494000853/?refId=0S0DwtAk2i1eLYXaYYAQJA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=gHjW6Ie6uSb7%2BkVFr%2FXcfQ%3D%3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operations associate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> role, posted on Wednesday, is a bit more vague about whether the new hire would be on the ground in NYC or not. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://shorthand.com/">Shorthand</a>, the Australian startup behind a no-code platform that allows publishers and brands to create multimedia stories, has raised $10 million Australian (just under $8 million U.S.) from Fortitude Investment Partners.</p>
<p>CEO Ricky Robinson told me via email that this is Shorthand&#8217;s first institutional round of funding, and that the company has been profitable for the past two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been lucky enough to grow to where we are today through an entirely inbound, organic model that leverages the beautiful content that our customers create in Shorthand to generate leads,&#8221; Robinson wrote. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve been testing other channels with some success and the time is right to ramp up those other marketing initiatives. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll be spending this funding, while also investing heavily in our product to keep Shorthand at the cutting edge of storytelling innovation for the web.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those customers include the BBC, Dow Jones, the University of Cambridge, Nature, Manchester City FC and Peloton. For example, BBC News used Shorthand to create <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/nxVbFidDbs/mission-jurassic">this story about searching for dinosaur fossils</a>.</p>
<p>The Shorthand website extols the virtues of &#8220;<a href="https://shorthand.com/features/scrollytelling">scrollytelling</a>,&#8221; where a reader can trigger interesting transitions and effects simply by scrolling through the story. Robinson suggested that this is a way to make stories feel interactive and engaging &#8220;without asking your audience to learn how to interact with it.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpOFXNR55wo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>As you can see in the demo video above, Shorthand offers a fairly straightforward drag-and-drop interface for adding different text and media elements, as well as effects. Robinson said that unlike other tools like Webflow and Ceros, Shorthand was designed to be used by editors and writers. And although Shorthand does support the use of themes and templates, he said that&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to provide flexibility without making writers get into the weeds of web design or making them use complicated design tools,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The focus should be at the level of <em>story</em> design, not <em>web</em> design, and that’s really what sets Shorthand apart, and it&#8217;s why our customers are able to consistently produce highly engaging, award-winning content for their audiences.&#8221;</p>

<p>The company also says that demand has only increased during the pandemic, with usage quadrupling in the fourth quarter of 2020 and subscription revenue up 8.8% month-over-month in February of this year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Open-source software gave birth to a slew of useful software in recent years. Many of the great technologies that we use today were born out of open-source development: Android, Firefox, VLC media player, MongoDB, Linux, Docker and Python, just to name a few, with many of these also developing into very successful for-profit companies.</p>
<p>While there are some dedicated open-source investors such as the Apache Software Foundation incubator and OSS Capital, the majority of open-source companies will raise from traditional venture capital firms.</p>
<p>Our team has raised from traditional venture capital firms like Speedinvest, open-source-specific firms like OSS, and even from more hybrid firms like OpenOcean, which was created by the founders and senior leadership teams at MariaDB and MySQL. These companies understandably have a significant but not exclusive open-source focus.</p>
<p>Our area of innovation is an open-source AutoML server that reduces model training complexity and brings machine learning to the source of the data. Ultimately, we feel democratizing machine learning has the potential to truly transform the modern business world. As such, we successfully raised $5 million in seed funding to help bring our vision to the current marketplace.</p>
<p>Here, we aim to provide insights and advice for open-source startups that hope to follow a similar path for securing funding, and also detail some of the important risks your team needs to consider when crafting a business model to attract investment.</p>
<h2>Strategies for acquiring open-source seed funding</h2>
<p>Obviously, venture capitalists find many open-source software initiatives to be worthy investments. However, they need to understand any inherent risks involved when successfully commercializing an innovative idea. Finding low-risk investments that lead to lucrative business opportunities remains an important goal for these firms.</p>
<p>In our experience, we found these risks fall into three major categories: market risk, execution risk, and founders’ risk. Explaining all three to potential investors in a concise manner helps dispel their fears. In the end, low-risk, high-reward scenarios obviously attract tangible interest from sources of venture capital.</p>
<p>Ultimately, investment companies want startups to generate enough revenue to reach a valuation exceeding $1 billion. While that number is likely to increase over time, it remains a good starting point for initial funding discussions with investors. Annual revenue of $100 million serves as a good benchmark for achieving that valuation level.</p>
<h2>Market risks in open-source initiatives</h2>
<p>Market risks for open-source organizations tend to be different when compared to traditional businesses seeking funding. Notably, investors in these traditional startups are taking a larger leap of faith.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">However the outcome of today’s vote count turned out, there was one thing we knew for certain: it wasn’t going to mark the end of the battle between Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. With voting having broken overwhelmingly in Amazon’s favor, the union was quick to challenge the results.</p>
<p>The RWDSU was quick to offer TechCrunch a statement from President Stuart Appelbaum after no votes broke the 50% threshold, noting, “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon&#8217;s behavior in corrupting this election.”</p>
<p>Amazon, unsurprisingly, was quick to take a victory lap. In a blog post credited to “Amazon Staff,” the company writes:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Thank you to employees at our BHM1 fulfillment center in Alabama for participating in the election. There’s been a lot of noise over the past few months, and we’re glad that your collective voices were finally heard. In the end, less than 16% of the employees at BHM1 voted to join the RWDSU union. It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the company was quick to state that the election is “over,” the RWDSU is hopeful, both in terms of future organizing at the Bessemer warehouse and for what the movement will mean for unionizing efforts at Amazon, going forward.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AIQ7k0ThKS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/">More tech workers are starting to unionize</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More tech workers are starting to unionize&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/more-tech-workers-are-starting-to-unionize/embed/#?secret=AIQ7k0ThKS" data-secret="AIQ7k0ThKS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a press conference held earlier today, Appelbaum suggested that Amazon told workers that they would have to vote against the union if they wanted to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>“We believe a rerun election is going to be very likely,” the union president told media. “I think that if Amazon considers this a victory, they may want to reconsider it. At best, it’s a Pyrrhic victory. Look at what happened during this period. We exposed atrocious working conditions at Amazon for everybody to see.”</p>
<p>Appelbaum’s comments seem to refer, in part, to numerous reports of workers urinating in bottles over concerns about stringent quotas. In the midst of an aggressive social media campaign at the apparent behest of CEO Jeff Bezos, the company initially denied reports, before conceding they may apply to some drivers. Amazon was quick to deflect blame to broader industry issues, however.</p>
<p>“Amazon didn’t win—our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union,” the company added in its post. &#8220;Our employees are the heart and soul of Amazon, and we’ve always worked hard to listen to them, take their feedback, make continuous improvements, and invest heavily to offer great pay and benefits in a safe and inclusive workplace. We’re not perfect, but we’re proud of our team and what we offer, and will keep working to get better every day.”</p>
<p>A key part to the RWDSU’s challenge is a ballot box the company reportedly pressured the USPS to install, in defiance of a National Labor Relations Board ruling. Appelbaum said the box “creates the impression of surveillance.”</p>
<p>He added that the union has already been in communication with workers at other Amazon facilities, explaining, “We have already started talking to workers at other facilities, as well, before this election.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Amazon has offered the following statement about the ballot box, &#8220;We said from the beginning that we wanted all employees to vote and proposed many different options to try and make it easy. The RWDSU fought those at every turn and pushed for a mail-only election, which the NLRB&#8217;s own data showed would reduce turnout. This mailbox—which only the USPS had access to—was a simple, secure, and completely optional way to make it easy for employees to vote, no more and no less.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers say APKPure, a widely popular app for installing older or discontinued Android apps from outside of Google&#8217;s app store, contained malicious adware that flooded the victim&#8217;s device with unwanted ads.</p>
<p>Kaspersky Lab <a href="https://securelist.com/apkpure-android-app-store-infected/101845/?/kaspersky/april8/index.html">said that</a> it alerted APKPure on Thursday that its most recent app version, 3.17.18, contained malicious code that siphoned off data from a victim&#8217;s device without their knowledge, and pushed ads to the device&#8217;s lock screen and in the background to generate fraudulent revenue for the adware operators.</p>
<p>But the researchers said that the malicious code had the capacity to download other malware, potentially putting affected victims at further risk.</p>
<p>The researchers said the APKPure developers likely introduced the malicious code, known as a software development kit or SDK, from an unverified source. APKPure removed the malicious code and pushed out a new version, 3.17.19, and the developers <a href="https://apkpure.com/apkpure/com.apkpure.aegon/versions">no longer list</a> the malicious version on its site.</p>
<p>APKPure was set up in 2014 to allow Android users access to a vast bank of Android apps and games, including old versions, as well as app versions from other regions that are no longer on Android&#8217;s official app store Google Play. It later launched an Android app, which also has to be installed outside Google Play, serving as its own app store to allow users to download older apps directly to their Android devices.</p>

<p>APKPure is ranked as <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/apkpure.com">one of the most popular sites</a> on the internet.</p>
<p>But security experts have long warned against installing apps outside of the official app stores as quality and security vary wildly as much of the Android malware requires <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/android-malware-system-update/">victims to install malicious apps</a> from outside the app store. Google scans all Android apps that make it into Google Play, but some have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/android-users-tricked-adware-apps/">slipped through the cracks</a> before.</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted APKPure for comment but did not hear back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given the pandemic, huge changes are being wrought in tech events, something which used to be the lifeblood of the industry. Many a startup has pitched to win funding, and many a hackathon has formed teams that went on to greater things. It’s a sad fact that this era is over, at least until the pandemic has fully passed, but this could take some time. Two significant European events have now had to change in order to carry their brands into new realms.</p>
<p>European breakout success story <a href="http://Infobip.com">Infobip</a> (which has raised more than $200 million) was born out of Croatia. And so was the seminal developer conference <a href="https://shiftconf.co/">Shift</a>. With Infobip needing that engineering community, and Shift needing a more stable home in uncertain times, it seems only natural that Infobip would put developers front and center of their company strategy with the acquisition of Shift, and appointing its founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanburazin/">Ivan Burazin</a> to the board as chief developer experience officer. Shift will now form the basis of Infobip’s all-new Developer Experience department.</p>
<p>As Burazin said: “The vision was always to become one of the largest developer conferences in the world, and also to strengthen Croatia’s connection to the world of software developers. So now with the backing of a unicorn and the freedom to keep working on independently, the vision seems to have finally become possible.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says Shift won’t disappear, but will now expand globally, first to the U.S. and then to Latin America and southeast Asia, initially in remote events.</p>
<p>Infobip CEO Silvio Kutić said: “Infobip is on a growth trajectory to expand rapidly into the B2C vertical, or more specifically Business-to-Developer (B2D) space. Having Ivan on board with his experience as the founder of Codeanywhere, a B2D SaaS company, and creator of Shift, the largest developer conference in the region, will be an asset to us going forward.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a key startup and founder/investor-oriented conference &#8220;Tech Open Air Berlin” is also changing.</p>
<p>Tech Open Air (TOA), was known for its technology and startup festival, which attracted upwards of 20,000 people in Berlin every summer, but it has now pivoted into a new brand: <a href="http://toaklub.com">TOA Klub</a>. This will now be a “cohort-based learning and doing platform.” The four-six weeks of online programs will be aimed at helping professionals progress in the tech industry.</p>
<p>TOA Klub will offer Founders Klub (for founders learning to startup); Investors Klub (for newbie investors); Crypto Klub (a “crash course in the crypto field”); and Co-Creators Klub (for founders looking to pivot and grow).</p>
<p>The first confirmed mentors and speakers include Rolf Schrömgens (founder, Trivago), Dominik Richter (founder, HelloFresh) and Jeannette zu Fürstenberg (founding partner, La Famiglia VC).</p>
<p>Nikolas Woischnik, founder of TOA said: “The world will come out of this pandemic having digitally aged by decades, not years. The complexity of our business environment has greatly accelerated. At TOA this gives our long-time mission of &#8220;making people, organizations and the planet futureproof&#8221; ever more purpose. With the launch of Klub, it is time for us to leverage technology to deliver on our mission in a more impactful and accessible way.”</p>
<p>I for one am glad these greats brands have found new homes, because I know the brands and the founders both carry huge respect in the European startup scene.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bain Capital Ventures managing director Sarah Smith talks about how to ensure the critical early hires are the right ones to grow a business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From building out Facebook&#8217;s first office in Austin to putting together most of Quora&#8217;s team, Bain Capital Ventures managing director Sarah Smith has done a bit of everything when it comes to hiring. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a>, she spoke about how to ensure the critical early hires are the right ones to grow a business. As an investor at Bain Capital Ventures, Smith has a broad view into the problems that companies face as they search for the right candidate to spur organizational success.</p>
<p>In our conversation, Smith touched on a number of issues such as who to hire and when, when to fire, and how to ensure diversity from the earliest days.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What to consider when you first think about hiring</h3>
<p>When a company is making its first hires — and then evolving into a bigger organization — the processes and needs may change, but the culture should be consistent from the beginning, according to Smith. From there, an emphasis on good early managers is critical.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would really encourage you to take some time to think about what kind of company you want to make first before you go out and start interviewing people. So that really is going to be about understanding and defining your culture. And then the second thing I&#8217;d be thinking about when you&#8217;re scaling from, you know, five people up to, you know, 50 and beyond is that managers really are the key to your success as a company. It&#8217;s hard to overstate how important managers, great managers, are to the success of your company.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ll talk a little bit about how to think about that, as there&#8217;s a lot of questions around helping people grow into management for the first time. You, as a founder, might be managing people for the first time, so how to think about setting up the company for success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/joby-aviation/">Joby Aviation</a> founder JoeBen Bevirt has spent more than a decade developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft — an effort that was largely shrouded in secrecy until January 2020 when the company announced a $590 million Series C round of funding that was led by Toyota Motor Corporation (that round later expanded to $620 million).</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The buzzy announcements continued with Joby&#8217;s acquisition of Uber Elevate and then culminated in February with its bid to become a publicly traded company through a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners, a special purpose acquisition company from well-known investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Zynga founder Mark Pincus.</p>
<p>Joby is just getting started. The company plans to use capital generated via its public listing to fund the launch of passenger service, which is expected to begin in 2024. And Joby still must complete certification of its aircraft and develop manufacturing facilities, but it is already on its way to achieving both. The company is also planning to begin construction on a 450,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, designed in conjunction with Toyota, later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The upshot: Bevirt has a lot to share. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to announced that Bevirt and Hoffman will join us on our virtual stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>. The virtual event, which features the best and brightest minds in the world of mobility, will be held on June 9. Bevirt and Hoffman will discuss building a startup — and keeping it secret while raising funds — the future of flight and, of course, SPACs.</p>
<p>The pair will join other speakers TechCrunch has announced, a list that so far <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/investors-clara-brenner-quin-garcia-and-rachel-holt-are-coming-to-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">includes investors</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/clara-brenner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Clara Brenner</strong></a> of Urban Innovation Fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/quin-garcia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Quin Garcia</strong></a> of Autotech Ventures and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/rachel-holt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rachel Holt</strong></a> of Construct Capital, as well as Starship Technologies co-founder and CEO/CTO Ahti Heinla. Stay tuned for more announcements in the weeks leading up to the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We approach it (SPACs) as venture capital at scale,&#8221; Hoffman told TechCrunch in a February interview. So it&#8217;s not a &#8216;this-year thing,&#8217; it&#8217;s a next three years, next five years, next 10 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yes, Hoffman believes SPACs are here to stay. Although we plan to check in on his stance in June. &#8220;I think that it&#8217;s valuable to the market and valuable to society to have multiple, different paths by which companies can go public,&#8221; Hoffman said.</p>

<p>As for Bevirt, the move to go public marks Joby&#8217;s readiness to be more open with the rest of the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think that this is a really exciting moment, where we stand on the threshold of really redefining mobility,&#8221; Bevirt said in a previous interview. &#8220;And we really want to bring the world along on our exciting journey. Previously, only a very exclusive set of investors has had access to be part of our journey, and it&#8217;s really exciting for us to be able to share that more broadly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>We can’t wait to hear from Bevirt and Hoffman at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> on June 9.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If we’ve said it once, we’ve said it 1,000 times. Startup Alley is ground zero for entrepreneurial opportunity. It’s where hundreds of savvy, exhibiting startups increase their brand recognition, connect with investors, grow their network, expand their customer base and garner invaluable media coverage.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place on September 21-23, and we’ve added new features and experiences to help Startup Alley exhibitors make the most of the virtual expo area. Ready to make a minimal investment for maximum opportunity? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=TRUE">Buy a Startup Alley Pass for $199</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Play beat the clock:</strong> That super early-bird price remains in effect only until <strong>May 13 at 11:59 pm (PST).</strong> Get moving, and you’ll save $50.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s what’s new in Startup Alley this year, starting with yet another reason to get your exhibitor&#8217;s pass ASAP.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">Startup Alley+</a>:</strong> TechCrunch will select 50 Startup Alley exhibitors to form an elite cohort. These founders receive — at no additional cost — access to a curated pre-Disrupt experience. You’ll compete in a pitch-off at Extra Crunch Live, attend a series of founder masterclasses and receive introductions to top early-stage investors. It’s specifically designed to provide more opportunities for exposure and growth before Disrupt even opens.</p>
<p>The timing matters because Startup Alley+ begins in July at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising</a> — and the cohort attends for free. If you want a crack at this opportunity, get your exhibitor pass now.</p>
<p><strong>The Startup Alley Crawl:</strong> Every tech category gets a dedicated, hour-long crawl. TechCrunch editors will select several startups from each category and interview the founders live from the Disrupt stage. We’ll list the specific times for each in the agenda closer to the event.</p>
<p><strong>From Startup Alley to Startup Battlefield:</strong> TechCrunch will award two stand-out startups a Startup Battlefield Wild Card. Those founders will get to compete in the thrilling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> for a chance to win $100,000.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone pitches:</strong> Every exhibiting startup is eligible for this opportunity. You’ll have two minutes to throw your best pitch across the plate and receive feedback from pitch-savvy TechCrunch staff. Talk about an opportunity to improve and impress. Your pitch session can have long-term benefits — as told to us by Jessica McLean, the director of Marketing and Communications at Infinite-Compute.</p>
<p>“Disrupt is a great avenue to network with potential investors. It carries a lot of street cred and talking about our CEO’s experience pitching in Startup Alley helps us make those connections and start important conversations.”</p>
