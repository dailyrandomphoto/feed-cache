										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech employees build amazing consumer-facing apps for the world. But for their internal communications, they are stuck using applications that don’t play well with one another.</p>
<p>This is a problem since most employees at a mid-sized or large-sized firm spend a fourth or third of their days on internal communication applications.</p>
<p>Now a San Francisco-headquartered startup is attempting to build a software that makes it much more convenient to engage with business services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gorattle.com">Rattle</a> is building a real-time and collaborative “connectivity tissue” to address the siloed nature of modern record-keeping and intelligence platforms, said Sahil Aggarwal, co-founder and chief executive of the eponymous startup, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“To use Salesforce, as an example, you are using it for two things: you’re writing data into Salesforce and you’re taking data out of it,” he explained. “What Rattle does is it enables you to send all the insights from Salesforce into a messaging platform and then lets you write data from within the messaging service back into Salesforce.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2196241 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rattle.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rattle.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rattle.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rattle.jpg?resize=300,137 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rattle.jpg?resize=768,350 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rattle.jpg?resize=680,310 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rattle.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Rattle’s usecase extends to even more services. It can recognize phone calls and prompt individuals to log that and pursue that opportunity on Slack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We started with integrating Slack and Salesforce, and now with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">their acquisition</a> the idea has been definitely gotten validated. It’s so so transformational for companies,” said Aggarwal, who got the idea about this startup at his previous venture when an application he built for the internal team received great feedback.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched its offering in March, is already seeing over 70% conversion rate among enterprises that have given it a try. Rattle has amassed over 50 customers including Terminus, Olive, Litmus, Imply and Parsely.</p>
<p>After implementing Rattle “[our] lead response time has gone down by 75% and key processes have sped up from days to minutes,” said Jeff Ronaldi, GTM Ops Manager at LogDNA.</p>
<p>The startup announced on Tuesday that it has raised a seed round of $2.8 million from Lightspeed and Sequoia Capital India. Amy Chang (EVP at Cisco &amp; Disney board member), Ellen Levy (early investor in Outreach), Jake Seid (early investor in Brex &amp; Carta), and Krish &amp; Raman (the founders of unicorn SaaS firm Chargebee) also participated in the round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Businesses worldwide are mired in processes &#8211; from sales to marketing, HR, IT, and more. With increased digitization and remote work, processes and adherence thereof are only going to diverge over time,” said Hemant Mohapatra, Partner at Lightspeed, in a statement. “The Rattle team impressed us by their unrelenting focus on the most important piece of this puzzle: the people caught in these processes. Rarely have we seen such intense customer love so early in a company&#8217;s life and are honored to go on this journey with Rattle together!&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup, which charges anywhere between $20 to $30 per user per month, plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its product offerings including adding integration with more enterprise applications.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The voices on Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, Google Assistant and other AI assistants are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-09-in-pursuit-of-the-perfect-ai-voice.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">far ahead</a> of old-school GPS devices, but they still lack the rhythms, intonation and other qualities that make speech sound, well, human. NVIDIA has unveiled new research and tools that can capture those natural speech qualities by letting you train the AI system with your own voice, the company announced at the <a href="https://www.interspeech2021.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Interspeech 2021</a> conference.</p>
<p>To improve its AI voice synthesis, NVIDIA’s text-to-speech research team developed a model called RAD-TTS, a winning entry at an NAB broadcast convention competition to develop the most realistic avatar. The system allows an individual to train a text-to-speech model with their own voice, including the pacing, tonality, timbre and more.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RknIx6XmffA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Another RAD-TTS feature is voice conversion, which lets a user deliver one speaker&#8217;s words using another person&#8217;s voice. That interface gives fine, frame-level control over a synthesized voice’s pitch, duration and energy.</p>
<p>Using this technology, NVIDIA&#8217;s researchers created more conversational-sounding voice narration for its own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHnYvH1qtObE_PjzaAFqS_CpmumGx5cW" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">I Am AI video series</a> using synthesized rather than human voices. The aim was to get the narration to match the tone and style of the videos, something that hasn&#8217;t been done well in many AI narrated videos to date. The results are still a bit robotic, but better than any AI narration I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this interface, our video producer could record himself reading the video script, and then use the AI model to convert his speech into the female narrator’s voice. Using this baseline narration, the producer could then direct the AI like a voice actor — tweaking the synthesized speech to emphasize specific words, and modifying the pacing of the narration to better express the video’s tone,&#8221; NVIDIA wrote.</p>
<p>NVIDIA is distributing some of this research — optimized to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs, of course — to anyone who wants to try it via open source through the NVIDIA NeMo Python toolkit for GPU-accelerated conversational AI, available on the company&#8217;s NGC hub of containers and other software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Several of the models are trained with tens of thousands of hours of audio data on NVIDIA DGX systems. Developers can fine tune any model for their use cases, speeding up training using mixed-precision computing on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs,&#8221; the company wrote.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Octane, a metered SaaS billing system, helps vendors create a plan, monitor usage and charge in a similar way to Snowflake and AWS.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software billing startup <a href="https://www.getoctane.io/">Octane</a> announced Tuesday that it raised $2 million on a post-money valuation of $10 million to advance its pay-as-you-go billing software.</p>
<p>Akash Khanolkar and his co-founders met a decade ago at Carnegie Mellon University and since then went off in different directions. In Khanolkar’s case, he ran a cloud consulting business and saw how fast companies like Datadog and Snowflake were coming to market and dealing with Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>He found that the commonality in all of those fast-growing companies was billing software using a pay-as-you-go business model versus the traditional flat-rate plans, Khanolkar told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>However, he explained that monitoring consumption means that billing becomes complicated: companies now have to track how customers are using the software per second in order to bill correctly each month.</p>
<p>Seeing the shift toward consumption-based billing, the co-founders came back together in June 2020 to create Octane, a metered billing system that helps vendors create a plan, monitor usage and charge in a similar way to Snowflake and AWS, Khanolkar said.</p>
<p>“We are API-driven, and you as a vendor will send us usage data, and on our end, we store it and then do real-time aggregations so at the end of the month, you can accordingly bill customers,” Khanolkar said. “We have seen contention between engineering and product. Engineers are there to create core plans, so we built a no-code experience for product teams to be able to create new price plans and then perform changes, like adding coupons.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Within the global cloud billing market, which is expected to reach $6.5 billion by 2025, there are a set of Octane competitors, like Chargebee and Zuora, that Khanolkar said are tackling the subscription management side and succeeding in the past several years. Now there is a usage and consumption-based world coming and a whole new set of software businesses, like Octane, coming in to succeed there.</p>
<p>The new round of funding was led by Basis Set Ventures and included Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, Github CTO Jason Warner, Fortress CTO Assunta Gaglione, Scale AI CRO Chetan Chaudhary, former Twilio executive Evan Cummack, Esteban Reyes, Abstraction Capital and Script Capital.</p>
<p>“With the rise of product-led growth and usage-based pricing models, usage-based billing is a critical and foundational piece of infrastructure that has been simply missing,&#8221; said Chang Xu, partner at Basis Set Ventures, via email. &#8220;At the same time, it’s something that every department cares about as it’s your revenue. Many later-stage companies we talk to that have built this in-house talk about the ongoing maintenance costs and wishes that there is a vendor they can outsource it to.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are super impressed with the <span class="il">Octane</span> team with their dedication to building a best-in-class and robust usage-based billing solution. They’ve validated this opportunity by talking to lots of engineering teams so they can solve for all the edge cases, which is important in something as mission critical as billing. We are convinced that <span class="il">Octane</span> will become an inevitable part of the tech infrastructure.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Quolum announces $2.75M seed investment to track SaaS spending&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/quolum-announces-2-75m-seed-investment-to-track-saas-spending/embed/#?secret=tZrBiCtjcl" data-secret="tZrBiCtjcl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new funding will go primarily toward hiring engineers, as well as product, marketing and sales staff. Octane currently has seven employees, and Khanolkar expects to be around 10 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The company is working with a large range of companies, primarily focused on infrastructure and the depth gauge industries. Octane is also seeing some unique use cases emerge, like a construction company using the usage meter to track the hours an employee works and companies in electric charging using the meter for those purposes.</p>
<p>“We didn’t envision construction guys using it, but in theory, it could be used by any company that tracks time — even legal,” Khanolkar added.</p>
<p>He declined to speak about the company’s revenue, but did say it now had two to three years of runway.</p>
<p>Up next, the company plans to roll out new features like price experimentation based on usage to help customers better make decisions on how to price their software, another problem Khanolkar sees happening. It will build ways that customers can try different plans against usage data to validate which one works the best.</p>
<p>“We are still in the early innings of consumption-based models, but we see more end users opting to go with an enterprise that wants to let them try out the software and then pay as they go,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft offered a broad “Holiday 2021” release date when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/microsoft-announces-windows-11-generally-available-by-the-holidays/">announced Windows 11, back in June</a>. Of course, it didn’t specify precisely which holiday. Perhaps the company was aiming for World Teachers’ Day, a belated Sukkot or an extremely early Halloween. After strongly implying a late-October release a few months back (which some pointing to the 20th), the company this morning announced that the operating system is set to arrive October 5.</p>
<p>The date is, undoubtedly, on the early side of Microsoft’s release window. The first major release since 2015 will be available as a free upgrade to users with an eligible PC running Windows 10. October 5 will also see the availability of the first systems shipping with Windows 11 preloaded.</p>

<p>Frederic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/the-first-preview-of-windows-11-is-now-available/">wrote up the first preview build</a> when it became available through the Windows Insider Dev Channel. He noted at the time, “This is definitely more than just another bi-annual Windows 10 update with a few minor UI changes.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the company fittingly offers an <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176111">11 point blog post</a> highlighting the major changes that will arrive in the October update. The first – and most immediately apparent – is one that has been around since that earliest preview build. The operating system’s design has been refreshed for a cleaner feel throughout.</p>
<p>That includes new Snap Layouts, Groups and Desktops designed to offer a more organized approach to multitasking. A number of the company’s online services have been more deeply integrated into the OS. Microsoft 365 is built into the Start menu, offering up access to recently viewed files, for more cross-platform integration. Teams, meanwhile, has been added to the taskbar (Microsoft <em>really</em> wants you to use Teams, folks). You’ll find Widgets there, as well, with quick access to information like news, weather, sports and stocks.</p>

<p>There are a range of accessibility updates. In <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/07/01/whats-coming-in-windows-11-accessibility/">a lengthy post from July</a>, Microsoft highlights those updates, noting, “Accessible technology is a fundamental building block that can unlock opportunities in every part of society. A more accessible Windows experience has the power to help tackle the “disability divide” — to contribute to more education and employment opportunities for people with disabilities across the world.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Store get a design upgrade, as well, and the company has promised more access for independent developers to create new tools for the operating system. The new version of Windows continues to offer a focus on desktop gaming, with features like e DirectX12 Ultimate, DirectStorage and Auto HDR.</p>

<p>There’s been some confusion around what, precisely, all of this means for unsupported machines of late – as well, as, frankly, which <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/">machines qualify as supported</a>. It was <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/windows-11-wont-offer-windows-update-on-unsupported-devices">reported earlier this week</a> that those systems that don’t fall within Microsoft’s parameters won’t get Windows Update when the new operating system is installed manually. That’s obviously a massive bummer, given that the utility deliveries security patches and other updates.</p>
<p>“The free upgrade to Windows 11 starts on October 5 and will be phased and measured with a focus on quality,” the company writes in this morning’s post. “Following the tremendous learnings from Windows 10, we want to make sure we’re providing you with the best possible experience. That means new eligible devices will be offered the upgrade first. The upgrade will then roll out over time to in-market devices based on intelligence models that consider hardware eligibility, reliability metrics, age of device and other factors that impact the upgrade experience.”</p>
<p>The company says it expects all qualified machines will be offered the upgrade by some point in mid-2022. For those systems that aren&#8217;t upgraded, Microsoft says it will continue supporting Windows 10 through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630463044278000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7leN6NI0Cx3GReL0U4ITtgqmJrg">October 14, 2025</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Quip is focused on growth, innovation and community building among its over 7.5 million customers in 100 countries.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Quip is on a mission to be the go-to platform for both personal and professional oral care, and a new $100 million cash infusion is giving the New York-based company fuel to do it.</p>
<p>The new round from Cowen Sustainable Investments (CSI), labeled a Series B, follows the company reaching profitability in April 2020 and gives Quip more than $160 million in total funding since the company was founded in 2015. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/quip-raises-another-40-million-for-dental-care-products-and-services/">last publicly announced raise was $40 million</a> in 2018. The company showcased its service at TechCrunch Disrupt NY’s Startup Alley in 2015.</p>
<p>At that time, Quip was best known as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/04/quips-subscription-based-toothbrush-replacement-service-yes-really-raises-seed-funding/">subscription-based toothbrush replacement service</a>, but over the years has steadily taken on more of the <a href="https://emag.medicalexpo.com/the-global-dental-services-market-expected-to-grow-to-435-billion-in-2021-report/">$435 billion global oral healthcare market</a> by adding other products like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/quip-wants-to-help-you-floss/">flossers</a>, mouthwash, gum, smart electric toothbrushes and, most recently, a virtual orthodontist-enabled clear aligner service launched in April.</p>

<p>Company co-founder and CEO Simon Enever told TechCrunch that its long-term vision is to “build a lasting global business in the oral care category, and it is important to keep the business on the right scale.” Quip is focused on growth, innovation and community building among its over 7.5 million customers in 100 countries.</p>
<p>“The timing of this round, and raising such a significant round, was deliberate and strategic,” he added. “We wanted to prove a couple of things: that we create a high-profile, profitable core business that people know today, aligning the first pieces of the pie on our oral care app and then services, such as the clear aligner that we launched a couple of months ago.”</p>
<p>When Quip first launched and received funding six years ago, there were very few oral care startups and not much funding going into the space, Enever said. In fact, that was what led him to start the company in the first place — a dental visit eight years ago where he learned how little investment was being made to improve the space. Since then, more startups are innovating dental care and there is investment in both the personal care side and professional, especially in sub areas like orthodontics and appointment bookings, which Quip is working on, he added.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to further scale its personal care platform, which already has over 7.5 million users, and continue to connect them with a network of more than 50,000 dental professionals. It will also go into new verticals, expand its global footprint and roll out new features to its oral care companion mobile app.</p>
<p>Quip expects to reach over 1 million app users in 2022, Enever said. New features will complement the company’s mission to track oral habits, coaching and health monitoring. Members can then earn points by improving their habits and health and redeem them for products and discounts from Quip and other partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Enever also plans to double Quip’s 200-person team (located in New York and Salt Lake City) by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>“We had an amazing lean and driven team that has gotten us to the point where we are at now, and we are excited to scale that and have more support to take things to the next level,” he added. “It is incredible to watch the team. In the past few years, they hit their goals and launched four brand new personal care product lines, rolled out in Walmart and helped us become profitable. It has been amazing to watch the team despite the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Retail sales are up more than 100% compared to last year, according to the company. In addition to going into Walmart, the company’s products are also in Target, giving it over 10,000 retail locations.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Artem Mariychin, managing director at CSI, is joining the company’s board. CSI, an environmental sustainability focused growth investment strategy, looks for companies having a positive impact on the world’s environment, like addressing waste, which was one of the attractions to Quip, he said.</p>

<p>The company estimated over 100 million single-use plastic components were diverted from landfills through its paper packaging and refillable products recycling program. It aims to reach over 1 million pounds of plastic reduction or diversion in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Mariychin was also attracted to Quip’s growth versus other consumer companies and its ability to be capital efficient and also consumer-centric, something he said was unique in the oral care business.</p>
<p>“They aren’t expensive, but they are high-quality and solve consumer needs and pain points,” he said. “Simon’s origin was to improve brushing outcomes — only 50% of people brush twice a day now. However, with the brush built, they looked at what else they can do and expanded into the floss pick and mouthwash. What is impressive is that subscribers are now purchasing other products. Quip is now expanding into other parts of dental, like the liners, and that is atypical of others in e-commerce.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.walnut.io/">Walnut</a> raised $15 million in Series A funding, led by Eight Roads Ventures, to continue developing its sales experience platform.</p>
<p>Founders Yoav Vilner and Danni Friedland started the company in July 2020. Vilner told TechCrunch that while at a previous company, he was building a category called technology marketing in Israel. He realized that company sales people often ran into problems when it was time to demonstrate their product — the product would break, or they would have to ask another department to open something or add a feature, none of which happened instantaneously, Vilner added.</p>
<p>He and Friedland’s answer to that problem is a no-code platform for teams to create customized product demonstrations quickly, be able to integrate them into their sales and marketing processes and then generate insights from the demos.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195751" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2195751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="352" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=1536,794 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mock-engage.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195751" class="wp-caption-text">Walnut engagement example. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walnut</p></div></p>
<p>“We let the sales and marketing teams replicate the SaaS product in our cloud environment, which is disconnected from the back end,” Vilner explained. &#8220;They can create a storyline to fit their customer and the demonstration, and then following the demo, sales leaders can get insight on what was good or bad. It encourages the sharing of knowledge and what story worked best for which kind of company.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company’s latest round gives it $21 million raised to date, and follows a $6 million seed round that included NFX, A Capital, Liquid2 Ventures and Graph Ventures, Vilner said.</p>
<p>Walnut serves over 60 business-to-business clients, including Adobe, NetApp, Varonis and People AI. In addition to Tel Aviv, the company has offices in New York and London.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vilner intends to use the new funding to grow the team across the U.S, Europe and Israel and continue developing its technology and platform, including tools to embed demos into a website for product-led growth. He also expects to double the team of 25 over the next year.</p>
<p>Eyal Rabinovich, an investor at Eight Roads Ventures, said his brother is a Walnut customer, and the company fits with one of the firm’s theses around broad vertically integrated brands in SaaS and deep technology.</p>
<p>Rabinovich was tracking the sales enablement space for a while and said many companies claim to provide something unique, but it is usually workflow and processes. In Walnut’s case, it is solving something at the core of sales.</p>
<p>“They make everything measurable, and the ‘holy grail’ is conversion, and even just 1% conversion could mean millions of dollars,” he added. “Every company we spoke to wanted to use this product. Customers were telling us they closed the sales cycle within two weeks.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify today is officially <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-31/how-spotifys-newest-personalized-experience-blend-creates-a-playlist-for-you-and-your-bestie/">rolling out</a> its shared playlist feature called Blend to global users, with a few changes. Earlier this summer, Spotify had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/">first launched</a> the new shared playlist experience into beta testing. The feature, which allows two people to combine their favorite songs into one shared playlist, uses the same music mixing technology that powers other multi-person playlists like Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/family-mix/">Family Mix</a> and <a href="https://support.spotify.com/ie/article/duo-mix/">Duo Mix</a>. However, Blend allows any Spotify user, including both free users and paid subscribers, to merge their musical tastes, too.</p>
<p>The feature has been further developed since its beta release, Spotify says.</p>
<p>Now, users who create a Blend (aka their shared playlist) will get something called a &#8220;taste match score&#8221; that shows them how similar or different their listening preferences are, when compared with their friends. After the Blend is created for the first time, this taste match score is demonstrated as a percentage and will be accompanied by text that tells users which song brings them together.</p>
<p>Blends will also feature new cover art to help users find their playlists more easily.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2196202" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="260" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png 3841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=300,115 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=768,293 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=680,260 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=1536,587 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=2048,782 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Blend-Header.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Premium subscribers will get an extra perk, as well. On their version of a Blend, listeners will be able to see which of the user&#8217;s preferences contributed to each song on the playlist.</p>
<p>Spotify says during tests of Blend, Olivia Rodrigo took the top spot for the most-streamed artist on Blend playlists, followed by others like Doja Cat, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, and Lil Nas X.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature isn&#8217;t only meant to be serve a fun addition to Spotify. It&#8217;s also a user acquisition strategy. Since free users are able to create or join a Blend, the feature can serve as a way to entice someone to join Spotify for the first time &#8212; even if they currently don&#8217;t pay for music, or if they subscribe to a rival service. But once they&#8217;re in Spotify&#8217;s app, they may decide to stay, the thinking goes.</p>
<p>Blend was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/">announced in June alongside</a> a new in-app experience called Only You, which focuses on your favorite music and how you listen &#8212; sort of like a mid-year version of Spotify&#8217;s popular annual retrospective, Spotify Wrapped. Like Only You, Blend includes support for social sharing. Users will be able to share Blend&#8217;s &#8220;data stories&#8221; across their social channels. This is the screen that pops up immediately after a Blend is created, but can also be accessed from any time within the Blend playlist itself.</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s bigger message with features like this, which are released at a fairly steady cadence, is about conveying to users and competitors alike that&#8217;s it&#8217;s further ahead when it comes to personalization technology. Even though rivals now dupe Spotify&#8217;s ideas for playlists, the company tends to have something new to release shortly after, whether that&#8217;s Only You, or a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/spotify-launches-your-daily-drive-a-personalized-playlist-that-combines-music-and-podcasts/">playlist aimed at commuters</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/spotifys-latest-personalized-playlists-are-designed-for-your-workouts/">those for the gym</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spotify-adds-three-new-types-of-personalized-playlists-with-launch-of-spotify-mixes/">a collection of new mixes based on artists, genres and decades</a>.</p>
<p>You can access Blend from the Made for You hub on Spotify&#8217;s mobile app. To get started, you&#8217;ll click &#8220;Create Blend&#8221; then &#8220;invite&#8221; to select a friend to join your Blend. When the friend accepts, Spotify will create the cover art, tracklists and display your taste match score. You can then click &#8220;Share this Story&#8221; to post your data story to your social networks.</p>
<p>Blend will begin rolling out to all users worldwide, starting today. Large-scale rollouts can take time, so you don&#8217;t see it immediately, just check back later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the broader crypto world enjoys a late summer surge in enthusiasm, more and more blockchain developers who have taken the plunge are bumping into the blaring scaling issues faced by decentralized apps on the Ethereum blockchain. The popular network has seen its popularity explode in the past year but its transaction volume has stayed frustratingly stable as the network continues to operate near its limits, leading to slower transaction speeds and hefty fees on the crowded chain.</p>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s core developers have been planning out significant upgrades to the blockchain to rectify these issues, but even in the crypto world&#8217;s early stages, transitioning the network is a daunting, lengthy task. That&#8217;s why developers are looking to so-called Layer 2 rollup scaling solutions, which sit on top of the Ethereum network and handle transactions separately in a cheaper, faster way, while still recording the transactions to the Ethereum blockchain, albeit in batches.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Layer 2 landscape is early, but crucial to the continued scalability of Ethereum. As a result, there&#8217;s been quite a bit of passionate chatter among blockchain developers regarding the early players in the space. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Offchain Labs has been developing one particularly hyped rollup network called Arbitrum One, which has built up notable support and momentum since it beta-launched to developers in May, with about 350 teams signing up for access, the company says. </span></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve attracted some high-profile partnerships including Uniswap and Chainlink who have promised early support for the solution. The company has also quickly piqued investor interest. The startup tells TechCrunch it raised a $20 million Series A in April of this year, quickly followed up by a $100 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners which closed this month and valued the company at $1.2 billion. Other new investors include Polychain Capital, Ribbit Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Pantera Capital, Alameda Research and Mark Cuban.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196045" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196045" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2196045" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/founders-casual.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196045" class="wp-caption-text">Offchain Labs co-founders Felton, Goldfeder and Kalodner</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a fairly lengthy ride for the Arbitrum technology to public access. The tech was first developed at Princeton &#8212; you can find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpzrLOk4Zy0">YouTube video</a> where the tech is first discussed in earnest back in early 2015.  Longtime Professor Ed Felton and his co-founders CEO Steven Goldfeder and CTO Harry Kalodner detailed a deeper underlying vision in a 2018 research paper before licensing the tech from Princeton and building out the company. Felton previously served as the deputy U.S. chief technology officer in the Obama White House, and &#8212; alongside Goldfeder &#8212; authored a top textbook on cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>After a lengthy period under wraps and a few months of limited access, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the startup is ready to launch the Arbitrum One mainnet publicly, they tell TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This team&#8217;s scaling solution has few direct competitors &#8212; a16z-backed Optimism is its most notable rival &#8212; but Arbitrum&#8217;s biggest advantage is likely the smooth compatibility it boasts with decentralized applications designed to run on Ethereum, compared with competitors that may require more heavy-lifting on the developer&#8217;s part to be full compatibility with their rollup solution. That selling point could be a big one as Arbitrum looks to court support across the Ethereum network and crypto exchanges for its product, though most Ethereum developers are well aware of what&#8217;s at stake broadly.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;There’s just so much more demand than there is supply on Ethereum,&#8221; Goldfeder tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Rollups give you the security derived from Ethereum but a much better experience in terms of costs.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As artificial intelligence continues to weave its way into more enterprise applications, a startup that has built a platform to help businesses, especially non-tech organizations, build more customized AI decision making tools for themselves has picked up some significant growth funding. <a href="https://peak.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peak AI</a>, a startup out of Manchester, England, that has built a &#8220;decision intelligence&#8221; platform, has raised $75 million, money that it will be using to continue building out its platform as well as to expand into new markets, and hire some 200 new people in the coming quarters.</p>
<p>The Series C is bringing a very big name investor on board. It is being led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, with previous backers Oxx, MMC Ventures, Praetura Ventures, and Arete also participating. That group participated in Peak&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/peak-ai-nabs-21m-for-a-platform-to-help-non-tech-companies-make-ai-based-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B of $21 million</a>, which only closed in February of this year. The company has now raised $119 million; it is not disclosing its valuation.</p>
<p>(This latest funding round was <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/softbank-vision-fund-takes-stake-in-uk-ai-start-up-peak-12389426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored last week</a>, although it was not confirmed at the time and the total amount was not accurate.)</p>
<p>Richard Potter, Peak&#8217;s CEO, said the rapid follow-on in funding was based on inbound interest, in part because of how the company has been doing.</p>
<p>Peak&#8217;s so-called Decision Intelligence platform is used by retailers, brands, manufacturers and others to help monitor stock levels, build personalized customer experiences, as well as other processes that can stand to have some degree of automation to work more efficiently, but also require sophistication to be able to measure different factors against each other to provide more intelligent insights. Its current customer list includes the likes of Nike, Pepsico, KFC, Molson Coors, Marshalls, Asos, and Speedy, and in the last 12 months revenues have more than doubled.</p>
<p>The opportunity that Peak is addressing goes a little like this: AI has become a cornerstone of many of the most advanced IT applications and business processes of our time, but if you are an organization &#8212; and specifically one not built around technology &#8212; your access to AI and how you might use it will come by way of applications built by others, not necessarily tailored to you, and the costs of building more tailored solutions can often be prohibitively high. Peak claims that those using its tools have seen revenues on average rise 5%; return on ad spend double; supply chain costs reduce by 5%; and inventory holdings (a big cost for companies) reduce by 12%.</p>
<p>Peak&#8217;s platform, I should point out, is not exactly a &#8220;no-code&#8221; approach to solving that problem &#8212; not yet at least: it&#8217;s aimed at data scientists and engineers at those organizations so that they can easily identify different processes in their operations where they might benefit from AI tools, and to build those out with relatively little heavy lifting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There have also been different market factors that have also played a role. Covid-19, for example, and the boost that we have seen both in increasing &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; in businesses, and making e-commerce processes more efficient to cater to rising consumer demand and more strained supply chains, have all led to businesses being more open to and keen to invest in more tools to improve their automation intelligently.</p>
<p>This, combined with Peak AI&#8217;s growing revenues, is part of what interested SoftBank. The investor has been long on AI for a while, but it has been building out a section of its investment portfolio to provide strategic services to the kinds of businesses that it invests in. Those include e-commerce and other consumer-facing businesses, which make up one of the main segments of Peak&#8217;s customer base. Notably, one of its big, recent investments specifically in that space was made earlier this year <em>also</em> in Manchester, when it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-thg-raise-1-bln-softbank-unit-fund-large-portion-2021-05-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took a $730 million stake</a> (with potentially $1.6 billion more down the line) in The Hut Group, which builds software for and runs D2C businesses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“In Peak we have a partner with a shared vision that the future enterprise will run on a centralized AI software platform capable of optimizing entire value chains,&#8221; Max Ohrstrand, senior investor for SoftBank Investment Advisers, said in a statement. &#8220;To realize this a new breed of platform is needed and we’re hugely impressed with what Richard and the excellent team have built at Peak. We’re delighted to be supporting them on their way to becoming the category-defining, global leader in Decision Intelligence.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not clear that SoftBank&#8217;s two Manchester interests will be working together, but it&#8217;s an interesting synergy if they do, and most of all highlights one of the firm&#8217;s areas of interest.</p>
<p>Longer term, it will be interesting to see how and if Peak evolves to be extend its platform to a wider set of users at the organizations that are already its customers.</p>
<p>Potter said he believes that &#8220;those with technical predispositions&#8221; will be the most likely users of its products in the near and medium term. You might assume that would cut out, for example, marketing managers, although the general trend in a lot of software tools has precisely been to build versions of the same tools used by data scientists for these tell technical people to engage in the process of building what it is that they want to use. &#8220;I do think it’s important to democratize the ability to stream data pipelines, and to be able to optimize those to work in applications,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://kevala.com/">Kevala</a>, the startup that collects and analyzes energy grid infrastructure data for utility companies, renewable energy providers, EV charging companies, regulators and other energy industry stakeholders, has raised $21 million in a Series A round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it will use the funds to grow its team from 60 employees to around 100 by the end of 2021 and increase the deployment of its grid analytics tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevala’s Assessor Platform, its interactive cloud-based grid analytics toolbox, allows a range of energy industry stakeholders to leverage massive quantities of data the company has collected from public sources, as well as from its clients, in order to predict and plan for things like “extreme weather events, renewable energy adoption and increasing demand from vehicle, building and industry electrification,” according to a statement released by the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, there is a greater range of energy sources and receptors than ever before. There&#8217;s also more extreme weather conditions, with the <a href="https://www.wwno.org/news/2021-08-29/mass-power-outages-reported-in-louisiana-hurricane-ida-could-leave-residents-in-dark-for-weeks">latest power outages in New Orleans due to Hurricane Ida</a> being a prime example of ways the current grid system falls short. Visualization software that uses AI to cross reference not only demand on the grid but also other relevant information, like demographics of a specific location, maps of electrical wires and locations of solar panels, is going to be essential for managing it all. Google’s moonshot arm, X, is starting to move into this space via a recent partnership with AES, an electricity distributor. The two will work together to </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aes-collaborates-with-x-the-moonshot-factory-on-new-grid-virtualization-technologies-to-accelerate-a-cleaner-energy-future-301346632.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">simulate and virtualize AES’s distribution grids in Indiana and Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While Google has big business muscle behind it, Kevala has been working in this space since 2014 and is potentially poised to become an industry leader. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kevala has first mover advantage in providing comprehensive big data analytics on grid infrastructure,” said Zulfe Ali, managing partner at C5 Capital, in a statement. C5 Capital’s fund focused on data-driven technologies transforming critical infrastructure, C5 Impact Partners LP, led the Series A round alongside Thin Line Capital. Senior energy sector executives Tom Werner, current chairman and former CEO of SunPower Corp., and Mark Ferron, former California Public Utilities Commissioner, also participated in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re incredibly excited to partner with the company as it expands into new markets such as cybersecurity and national security, as well as new geographies outside of the United States,” continued Ali. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevala already has nearly the entire country mapped in terms of above-ground distribution infrastructure, and is working on expanding its coverage internationally. The company’s data set, which Kevala founder and CEO Aram Shumavon says is in the terabytes range, is largely sourced from publicly available data. That can mean data that’s observable from satellite imagery or found in building permits that allow the company to see things like where wind turbines are located or where rooftop photovoltaic (PV), or solar powered, systems are. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can take all the houses in a localized area, check it against the weather, and see what the energy consumption will be, what do we think the PV production would be for all of the PVs on those rooftops, and you can start to see how investments in different technologies will affect the overall loading and utilization of the grid and begin to better understand how resources could be utilized to drive cost savings, or alternatively, might increase the cost of that infrastructure as a whole,” Shumavon told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a walkthrough of Kevala’s dashboard, Shumavon explained how energy industry stakeholders might be able to, say, predict which neighborhood might see an increase in EV ownership based on household income and other demographics data. From there, visualizing the ratio of electricity to rooftop PVs to other renewable energy is helpful in predicting power usage, but Shumavon took it a step further by playing out a scenario of placing a battery in that location. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Automotive startup Upstream raises $62M Series C to scale cloud-based security&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/automotive-cybersecurity-startup-upstream-raises-62m-series-c-to-scale-cloud-based-security/embed/#?secret=XPgUDfmSQp" data-secret="XPgUDfmSQp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could I reduce the cost of the grid in this area by limiting the need for building out new infrastructure in the form of wires, and instead shifting that load to another period of time?” said Shumavon. “And that savings can be also calculated for any investment that might be able to provide a similar service, whether it&#8217;s a battery or an investment in an energy efficiency measure, or potentially a rooftop PV system or a demand response program where you agree to not charge your car during peak hours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s just one example of the types of analyses Kevala is performing everyday. The startup also hopes to increase its cybersecurity services to help protect grid infrastructure. Shumavon said one area Kevala is particularly interested in is third-party devices that have the ability to be compromised and potentially used to destabilize the grid. For example, someone with malicious intent might hack into thousands of IoT-connected washing machines and suddenly turn on all of the heating coils in the machine, creating a drastically increased load that can affect both the supply and demand of electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitoring a situation like this is usually outside the control of traditional utility control systems, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shumavon says through overseeing energy use data, Kevala is able to observe anomalies and mitigate them when they happen, as well as plan for attacks on the horizon so stakeholders are ready with an appropriate response. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevala is also focusing on data privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing increasingly large amounts of information about end-use customers become potentially available when they use electricity and how advanced metering infrastructure, like smart meters, can contain very detailed information about when people consume electricity and how much,&#8221; said Shumavon. &#8220;Being able to make sure if those data need to be used by third parties that they&#8217;re not revealing information that would be considered personally identifiable is another area where we provide service, which is a strong corollary to cybersecurity work. We really see cybersecurity and privacy as two sides of the same coin.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a loved one with specialized care needs is incredibly challenging, but not something that people who have never had to deal with the issue would necessarily quite understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone who has had to help care for someone with special needs, the lack of options out there to navigate finding access to care providers is almost shocking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twin sisters Melanie Fountaine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Melissa Danielsen know the problem firsthand, having</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped take care of their brother, who had a developmental disability and severe epilepsy, for years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw the struggle for our family to find reliable care,” Danielsen told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he passed away 12 years ago at the age of 29, the siblings decided they wanted to dedicate their careers to making disability care accessible to families with complex care needs. They founded Josh’s Place, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a company that provided group home accommodations and other services to adults across Minnesota, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which ended up being acquired by REM Minnesota in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair then came up with the concept behind </span><a href="https://joshin.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital care platform that aims to connect care providers to families with specialized care needs. (Both companies were named after the sisters’ brother, who was named Josh). And today, that startup is announcing it has closed on a $3 million seed round of funding co-led by Anthemis Group and The Autism Impact Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshin started out as an app that creates a care plan that helps it match families to a “carefully vetted” trained caregiver. It has evolved to also include a corporate benefits program that involves Joshin partnering with companies who want to offer an inclusive care benefit to their employees.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196034" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196034" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196034 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joshin_Product1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="341" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joshin_Product1.jpg 2433w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joshin_Product1.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joshin_Product1.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joshin_Product1.jpg?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joshin_Product1.jpg?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joshin_Product1.jpg?resize=1536,771 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joshin_Product1.jpg?resize=2048,1028 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Joshin_Product1.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196034" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joshin</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated one in five families have complex health needs, ranging from children with neurodivergence to dependent adults with developmental and physical disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted the need for support, making it even more difficult to find necessary care. As such, many people (most of which are women) are finding they have to leave jobs to become full-time caregivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For too long, people with special health needs and their families have been underserved and had fragmented access to disability care providers,” said CEO Danielsen.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As ADA turns 30, tech is just getting started helping people with disabilities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/as-ada-turns-30-tech-is-just-getting-started-helping-people-with-disabilities/embed/#?secret=DZJ5TBT0Z8" data-secret="DZJ5TBT0Z8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COO Fountaine says that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically the care economy has focused on children under 12, or adults over 65 &#8212; childcare and eldercare, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Joshin really is positioned to be the leader in that huge age gap that&#8217;s out there,” she said. “We work with people at all stages of life, and I think it’s unfortunate that until now, that’s been missing from the conversation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital in part to grow its network of care providers. It also aims to expand its corporate benefits program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re continuing to scale our technology to lessen the burden of caregiving responsibilities for employees and their families,” added Danielsen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 12 months, Joshin’s community of members and caregivers has grown 200%. With the new funding, the startup plans to expand its services to Los Angeles and Seattle. It is currently operational in its home base of Minneapolis, Minn., Chicago and New York City.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshin will be soft launching in 8 new markets over the next few weeks and hopes &#8220;to be national very soon,” Fountaine said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is starting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with employers, and building up the data that it derives from that effort. Over the next year, it intends to partner with managed Medicaid organizations, and with both private and public insurance companies so that it &#8220;can get families access to this care, quickly,” said Danielsen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to make this to make quality care free for families who need it,” she told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Male, co-founder of the Autism Impact Fund, said his organization backs companies that are addressing unmet needs of the autism community. Finding, retaining, and coordinating care are three of the biggest hurdles that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families face, according to Male.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Joshin has a proven ability to provide a reliable means to source caregivers with diverse skill sets and potential to serve as a platform for streamlining access to a variety of critical yet highly fragmented services for the special needs community,” he said. “Given the current insurance payer landscape and employer emphasis on DEI, Joshin is not only generating strong impact for a large disability market, but is a monetizable opportunity as both a reimbursable service and as a benefit to employees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By partnering with employers, Male added, Joshin will help provide an environment of support that will allow “employees to quickly and easily access key resources and thus minimize downtime. “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Jones, managing director at Anthemis, said his firm doubled down on its investment in the startup because it saw in its founders “one of the strongest examples of founder-market fit out there.” (Anthemis also led the company’s $1.6 million funding round in July of 2020).</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The progress that they have made since our last investment &#8211; coupled with the insights that they have collected &#8211; led us to believe that doubling down in this round was a no-brainer,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the complexity that comes with building technology in the space &#8220;makes the barriers to entry very high,” Jones added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team&#8217;s grit, combined with their understanding of the problems and opportunities associated with disability-related care, set Joshin apart,&#8221; he wrote via email. &#8220;No other platform comes close in terms of having such specialized leaders at the helm, so it&#8217;s no surprise that corporates are lining up to add Joshin to their roster of employee benefits.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://humcapital.com/">Hum Capital</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blair-silverberg-4133775/">Blair Silverberg</a> thinks that the future of fundraising requires a return to old school Wall Street &#8211; sans the fraud.</p>
<p>Back in the day, he explained, people would go to Wall Street and request funding for different projects, such as a rail line from New Jersey to St. Louis or a new store. A banker would chat through all the financing options, analyze different tradeoffs, and eventually help business owners pick the best capital option for their goals.</p>
<p>“It was very, ‘let&#8217;s think about the problem we&#8217;re trying to solve, and then let’s make the financing fit,’” Silverberg said. “Today, we do the opposite.” Even with ample capital in the market, startup check-writing is still a game dictated by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/lunchclub-raises-4m-from-a16z-for-its-ai-warm-intro-service/">warm intros</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/dont-send-vc-a-cold-deck-ever-again-start-sending-video-pitches/">cold pitches, </a>and oftentimes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/the-story-behind-rent-the-runways-first-check/">sheer luck that the founder bugged the right person</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/how-to-fundraise-over-zoom-more-effectively/">the right way</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/craft-your-pitch-deck-around-that-one-thing-that-can-really-hook-an-investor/">the right time.</a></p>
<p>Silverberg said the current climate forces founders and investors to do a “crazy adversarial dance” when it comes to partnerships, which feels “backwards.” He wants his startup, Hum Capital, to bring optionality back into the mix.</p>
<p>“The dream scenario is that any company in the world uses Hum to articulate what they’re trying to do with their mission, and then gets all the relevant forms of financing just sitting right there waiting for them to pick the one that makes the most sense,” he said. No term-sheets for term-sheets sake, but instead, Hum Capital can be a clear way to visualize and compare different financing options for a company’s goal.</p>
<p>The nod to nostalgia has helped the startup land fresh capitalization for the future. Hum Capital announced today that it has raised $9 million in a Series A round led by Steve Jurvetson’s Future Ventures. Jurveston was an early investor in SpaceX, Tesla and Memphis Meats, which Silverberg thinks symbolizes that “[Hum Capital is] an equally world changing company.”</p>
<p>At this stage, Hum Capital’s product is easy to explain: it uses artificial intelligence and data to connect businesses to the some available funders on the platform. The startup connects with a capital-hungry startup, ingests financial data from over 100 SaaS systems including Quickbooks, Netsuite and Google Analytics, and then translates them to the some 250 institutional investors on its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a navigation engine for startups that aren’t sure whether they should go for venture debt, traditional VC, revenue-share financing options, or others. The average deal size is $6.4 million, but Hum can help founders access checks up to $50 million for their businesses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196018" style="width: 947px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196018" loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2196018" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hum-digital.gif" alt="" width="937" height="527" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196018" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hum</p></div></p>
<p>Hum is free for startups and investors to use for data-sharing purposes and eventual connections. The startup makes money by charging a 2% marketplace fee on capital raised whenever a deal is closed through its platform.</p>
<p>Founders could theoretically use Hum to meet investors and then close the deal offline to avoid the 2% fee. Silverberg said that most users to-date don’t do this because they want to be repeat customers during future fundraises.</p>
<p>Hum’s biggest challenge is that it isn’t human. In venture, especially at the earliest stages, most check-writing comes down to an investor believing in a person’s ambition (and maybe their pitch deck). Hum leans heavily on data as a determinant of success, and while numbers don’t lie, it could mean early ideas with big ambition are left without options.</p>
<p>Silverberg argued that Hum isn’t meant to replace chemistry, but can work to make sure that the business makes financial sense for an investor. Meetings still matter, but with Hum, he thinks a founder and investor can spend the 30 minute meeting talking about mission and vision, and skip other basics of the business.</p>
<p>Fair rebuttal aside, Hum could be limited in the sorts of startups that it funds long-term. It doesn’t need to find ways to fit into traditional VC &#8211; since most businesses aren’t venture-bacable, but it will need to find a way to make sure high-quality investors consistently use the platform for deal flow. Today, much of the investment on the platform is classified as venture debt.</p>
<p>Early adoption suggests some early trends. Companies from 46 states have uploaded data to its Intelligent Capital Market (ICM) platform, and nearly half of all companies on the platform come outside of California and New York.</p>
<p>To date, the platform has helped facilitate more than $400 million in capital transactions across 150 fee agreements. The majority of that money moved between March and now, with customers including SecurityScorecard, Evolv AI and Flaviar.</p>
<p>Hum Capital’s raise is announced in a time where traditional financing feels challenged: Carta <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/carta-says-it-just-used-its-own-product-to-establish-a-new-and-far-higher-valuation-for-itself/'">just raised money off of a valuation it set for itself</a>, Brex launched <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/brex-launches-150-million-venture-debt-business">a $150 million venture debt business, </a>and Clearco, an alternative to VC, raised money from VCs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">at an over a $2 billion valuation. </a></p>
<p>“[Resource allocation] as important as making the world multiplanetary, or global problems like climate change,” Silverberg said. “&#8230;We’re at the book sales stage of Amazon.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Owner.com provides a free online ordering, delivery and marketing platform for independent restaurants that puts them on a similar playing fields with large restaurant chains.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Independent restaurants don’t typically have the luxury to create their own online food ordering and delivery capabilities or negotiate for lower rates from legacy ordering platforms like the large restaurant chains do.</p>
<p>Here’s where <a href="http://www.owner.com/">Owner.com</a> comes in. The Beverly Hills-based company provides a free online ordering, delivery and marketing platform for independent restaurants that puts them on similar playing fields with the big guys. And unlike the legacy food delivery services, Owner.com restaurants own their customer data and can automate marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Adam Guild is the company’s 21-year-old co-founder and CEO, a high school dropout and a Thiel Fellow, who originally started by assisting his mother’s dog grooming business that was having difficulties attracting customers. After stepping in with some online marketing methods, her business grew, and later expanded into multiple locations. Guild then wanted to work with a bigger group of people and stumbled across restaurants while helping some clients create online landing pages.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7m7nQXFI69"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/starship-technologies-is-bringing-food-delivery-robots-to-four-more-us-college-campuses-this-year/">Starship Technologies is bringing food delivery robots to four more US college campuses this year</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Starship Technologies is bringing food delivery robots to four more US college campuses this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/starship-technologies-is-bringing-food-delivery-robots-to-four-more-us-college-campuses-this-year/embed/#?secret=7m7nQXFI69" data-secret="7m7nQXFI69" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With consumer demand shifting to primarily online ordering and delivery over the past 18 months, <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-food-delivery/worldwide">online ordering revenue</a> is expected to double from $248 billion in 2020 to $449 billion by 2025. Ordering platforms like Doordash, Uber Eats and Grubhub <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/01/food-delivery-apps-calorie-labeling/">control 80% of orders</a> and typically charge between 20% and 30% per order to restaurants and additional fees to consumers.</p>
<p>In contrast, Owner.com is free for restaurants and charges customers a flat $4 fee when they order from the website. Guild explained that larger restaurant chains have the buying power to negotiate lower rates, while independent restaurants do not. With the inability to keep up, some <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/26/restaurants-bars-closed-2020-jobs-lost-how-many-have-closed-us-covid-pandemic-stimulus-unemployment/">110,000 restaurants in the U.S. closed in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Guild initially bootstrapped his company, working with large restaurant chains, like P.F. Chang’s, drive online orders. Then the global pandemic hit. He ended up losing all of his revenue and had to let all of his employees go but one. To add to his bad luck, he was then rejected from Y Combinator and other accelerator programs.</p>
<p>“For the first three days, I was depressed,” Guild told TechCrunch. “I had spent two years building a company and now it was dead. In the same way we were disrupted, I began to think there was no better position to be in than a scrappy startup. I didn’t know what the next business would look like, so I started cold-calling restaurant owners, asking how I can be helpful and what type of technology they were looking for. Many of them told me that online ordering sucked, but if they didn’t solve it soon, they would go out of business.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One pivot and a year later with co-founder Dean Bloembergen, Owner.com closed on $10.7 million in seed funding led by SaaStr Fund, with participation from Redpoint Ventures and Day One Ventures, as well as a group of individual investors including Naval Ravikant, CNBC’s The Profit host Marcus Lemonis, The Kitchen Restaurant Group’s Kimbal Musk, DoNotPay founder Joshua Browder, Figma founder Dylan Field, The Chainsmokers and independent restaurant owners and customers of Owner.com.</p>
<p>Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaStr Fund, said restaurant SaaS was a space in which his firm was interested in investing, but thought it was a bit boring — there were already quite a few vendors in the space, like Toast and Grubhub, and most were just technology solutions. However, when he heard that Owner.com was a break-out company from the monotony, he said he had to take a look.</p>
<p>“The ability to own the customer relationship is that ultimate differentiation,” Lemkin said. “Their ultimate goal is to provide a robust technology platform to increase margins, have people order more and come back often.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Guild intends to use the new funding to continue product development and add new features like landing pages, the ability to make reservations and native apps for white-label service.</p>
<p>Since the launch last year, the company has reached a seven-figure run-rate and over 105% monthly revenue retention across over 700 restaurant locations, Guild said. To date, Owner.com has transacted over $18 million and helped its restaurant customers avoid paying $3 million to online order platform fees annually.</p>
<p>“It’s all about empowering the 40% of the restaurant industry that is run by people who started off in entry-level positions, and over the years, worked their way up to own the ‘American Dream,’ ” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Max Q is a weekly newsletter from TechCrunch all about space. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here to receive it weekly on Mondays in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>We had a few launches this week, including SpaceX&#8217;s first one after one of its longer recent pauses in activity. Astra hoped to have its first commercial payload mission go well, but instead it had one of the more visually interesting takeoff mishaps in private spaceflight.</p>
<h2>Astra&#8217;s launch drifts and then nearly recovers</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2196184" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E96A9faX0AM-qKi.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196184" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2196184" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E96A9faX0AM-qKi.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E96A9faX0AM-qKi.jpeg 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E96A9faX0AM-qKi.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E96A9faX0AM-qKi.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E96A9faX0AM-qKi.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E96A9faX0AM-qKi.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E96A9faX0AM-qKi.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E96A9faX0AM-qKi.jpeg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/E96A9faX0AM-qKi.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2196184" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Astra</p></div></p>
<p>Astra&#8217;s launch from Kodiak, Alaska was its first attempt since it nearly reached orbit with a successful test last year. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/">engines all lit as planned, but almost as quickly, one of those went out and the result was a rocket that nearly toppled over,</a> before floating horizontally for a while, while the remaining engines redistributed power to ultimately start the vehicle climbing skyward.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s perhaps more impressive that the Astra rocket didn&#8217;t crash and burn right away, even if this was ultimately a failure. The rocket eventually climbed to an altitude of around 160,000 feet before Astra&#8217;s flight engineers issued an abort command and the vehicle returned safely to Earth after the engines cut off.</p>
<p>This was a disappointment because the mission was meant to be Astra&#8217;s first commercial flight, since it was carrying a simulated test payload on behalf of client the U.S. Space Force. But it also was still technically a test, and the company says it gathered a lot of valuable data from the roughly 2.5 minutes that the rocket was flying before the abort command was given.</p>
<p>While the newly public Astra&#8217;s share price took a hit on the news, I think the more instructive bit for the company&#8217;s long-term fortunes will be how long it takes to recover from this mishap and try again, and also what the result will be of that follow-up mission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>SpaceX breaks in its new landing barge</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2196185" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shortfall-of-gravitas.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196185" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2196185" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shortfall-of-gravitas.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="545" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shortfall-of-gravitas.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shortfall-of-gravitas.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shortfall-of-gravitas.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shortfall-of-gravitas.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shortfall-of-gravitas.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shortfall-of-gravitas.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2196185" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SpaceX</p></div></p>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s return to flight was another of the Commercial Resupply Services flights it performs for NASA to the International Space Station, and this one went smoothly as usual. The cargo included a new robotic arm for use on the station, as well as interesting experiments including live ants.</p>
<p>The launch also saw SpaceX use its new &#8216;A Shortfall of Gravitas&#8217; autonomous drone ocean landing ship for the first time. This is the third drone ship that SpaceX has in its fleet, and everything went smoothly with the landing for a successful recovery of the first stage booster used for the flight.</p>
<h2>Blue Origin launches suborbital, non-crewed flight</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2196186" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ns-17-booster-landing.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196186" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2196186" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ns-17-booster-landing.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ns-17-booster-landing.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ns-17-booster-landing.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ns-17-booster-landing.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ns-17-booster-landing.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ns-17-booster-landing.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ns-17-booster-landing.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ns-17-booster-landing.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2196186" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blue Origin</p></div></p>
<p>Blue Origin has launched its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/watch-blue-origin-launch-a-test-of-nasas-future-moon-landing-tech-live/"> 17th New Shepard reusable rocket mission</a>, though this one wasn&#8217;t as impressive as its last effort: No Jeff Bezos on board. Unlike that first human spaceflight, there weren&#8217;t any passengers in the capsule this go around, but there were a healthy collection of experiments.</p>
<p>One of those was a NASA experimental landing system component that&#8217;s going to be used eventually for the agency&#8217;s lunar landing vehicle. The interesting subtext here is that Blue Origin is actually suing the agency over its award process for the human lander contract, which selected SpaceX (and only SpaceX) as a lunar lander vehicle provider earlier this year.</p>
<h2>Rocket Lab goes public</h2>

<p>Rocket Lab is now a public company, trading under the name RKLB on the NASDAQ after a SPAC merger. This is one of the largest private space companies yet to go public via any means, and our own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/peter-beck-on-rocket-labs-public-listing-debut-space-spacs-and-the-neutron-rocket/">Aria Alamalhodaei spoke to Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck</a> to get the low-down on the company and what it means to be a member of the public markets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ispace-unveils-bigger-moon-lander-capable-of-surviving-lunar-nights/">ispace is creating a larger lunar lander</a> that can make it through lunar nights. Its existing small lander design isn&#8217;t intended to last long in the dark, since its power reserves would deplete quickly and also the super low temperatures are not kind to most electronics.</p>
<h2>Join us at TC Sessions: Space in December</h2>
<p>Last year we held our first dedicated space event, and it went so well that we decided to host it again in 2021. This year, it&#8217;s happening December 14 and 15, and it&#8217;s once again going to be an entirely virtual conference, so people from all over the world will be able to join — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">you can, too</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The rumored satellite features for future iPhones are reserved for emergency uses only, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/apple-plans-to-add-satellite-features-to-iphones-for-emergencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg&#8217;s</em></a> Mark Gurman. A few days ago, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-leo-satellite-communication-165409961.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">report</a> by well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the next iPhones will come with support for Low Earth Orbit satellite calls and messages. Gurman&#8217;s sources said, however, that Apple isn&#8217;t turning its devices into actual satellite phones, at least for now. Instead, the tech giant is reportedly developing at least two emergency-related features relying on satellite networks.</p>
<p>The first feature is called Emergency Message via Satellite and will be added as a third protocol, alongside iMessage and SMS, to the Messages app. It&#8217;s apparently codenamed Stewie inside the company and will allow users to text emergency services even when there&#8217;s no signal, which sounds especially useful during emergencies in remote locations, such as mountains and forests.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The tool will also give users a way to text their emergency contacts simply by typing Emergency SOS in the recipient line. Messages will be restricted to a shorter length, but the senders&#8217; contacts will get a notification for them even if their phone is set to Do Not Disturb. Satellite messages will appear as gray bubbles instead of blue or green so they can be easily identified. Eventually, the feature could handle phone calls, as well.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Apple is also reportedly working on a second satellite feature that will allow users to report crisis situations like plane crashes and fires. This system will give users a way to report the incident at length and will ask them specifics, such as if anybody needs search-and-rescue services or if anybody in the vicinity is armed. It can also automatically send authorities the reporter&#8217;s location and their details from the Health app, such as their medical history, age, medications and information like height and weight. The feature can also a notify the reporter&#8217;s emergency contacts for them.</p>
<p>While both features sound useful, their availability is restricted by satellite location and reach. They might not work for some regions, and in some cases, users may have to walk outdoors in a certain direction where their iPhone can connect to a satellite. Also, Gurman&#8217;s sources said it&#8217;s unlikely that the features will be ready before the year ends, which means the next iPhones expected be announced sometime in September won&#8217;t be able to send messages via satellite yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the two years since Gatik AI came out of stealth, the autonomous vehicle startup has launched pilots with Walmart and Canadian retail giant Loblaw in its bid to prove that self-driving technology combined with box trucks is the secret economic sauce for hauling goods short distances.</p>
<p>Now, the company is expanding into Texas — its fourth market — with a fresh bundle of capital. Gatik said Tuesday it has raised $85 million in a Series B round led by new investor Koch Disruptive Technologies, the venture arm of Koch Industries. Existing investors Innovation Endeavours, Wittington Ventures, FM Capital, Dynamo Ventures, Trucks VC, Intact Ventures and others also participated. Gatik has raised $114.5 million to date.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very much in expansion mode in growth mode and felt that Koch Industries would add the most value,&#8221; Gatik CEO and co-founder Gautam Narang said in a recent interview, adding that he views the company as a strategic investor.</p>
<p>Gatik has been shuttling goods as part of pilot programs for Walmart in Arkansas and Louisiana and in Ontario, Canada for Loblaw Companies Limited. Gatik also struck a manufacturing partnership with Isuzu in 2020 with an aim to mass produce medium duty autonomous trucks by early 2023.</p>
<p>Unlike other autonomous delivery companies, Gatik isn&#8217;t targeting consumers. Instead, the startup is using its autonomous trucks to shuttle groceries and other goods from large distribution centers to retail locations. For instance, Gatik uses about five box trucks to carry goods for Loblaw. On one route in Arkansas, Gatik has removed the human safety driver, which means some of the autonomous box trucks used to carry goods are now &#8220;driverless.&#8221; The goal is to remove safety operators from all of its box trucks.</p>
<p>Gatik said it has opened an autonomous trucking facility in the AllianceTexas Mobility Innovation Zone, a 26,000-acre industrial, mixed-use, and residential planned development in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that has become a hub of transportation and logistics. The company is already carrying freight for several customers, which it declined to name. Narang did say that the trucks deployed in Texas are based on the Isuzu platforms.</p>
<p>The company plans to have presence in multiple cities within Texas, Narang said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its move to Texas follows other autonomous vehicle technology companies such as Aurora, Kodiak Robotics, TuSimple and Waymo that have set up shop in the state. The decision to expand into Texas was driven by its status an international shipping hub, the regulatory environment that supports autonomous vehicle testing and deployment on public roads and favorable weather. Narang added that the abundance and variety of potential customers will also allow it to have a multi-tenant operation. This means it can use the same truck throughout the day for multiple customers.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used add more vehicles to its fleet of Class 3-6 multi-temperature autonomous box trucks and hire more employees, particularly in Texas. Today, Gatik&#8217;s roughly 70 employees are spread between its headquarters in Palo Alto, engineering center in Toronto and operations in Arkansas and Louisiana.</p>
<p>Narang said they plan to double the number of employees to around 150 people in the next six to nine months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In India, a country that is more densely populated and has lower rates of car ownership, auto rickshaws and other two- or three-wheeled vehicles play a central role. While many auto rickshaws on Indian roads are already electric, they tend to rely on lead-acid batteries that need to be replaced every six to 11 months.</p>
<p>Power Global, a two-year-old startup, wants to disrupt the auto rickshaw market by offering a retrofit kit for diesel-powered vehicles and swappable battery pack to transition the more common lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion.</p>
<p>Power Global was founded by Porter Harris, who had previously engineered the batteries for SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft. He also worked as the chief battery engineer at EV startup Faraday Future. Thus far, he estimates Power Global has been around 95% self-funded – thanks in part to the sale of his SpaceX stock.</p>
<p>“I’ve been looking at the Indian market now for about five years,” he told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The opportunity is certainly ripe, with some <a href="https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/india-electric-rickshaw-market">market research firms</a> estimating that the electric rickshaw market in India will grow to $1.3 billion by 2025. It’s also dire: last year, 15 out of the top 20 most polluted cities in the world were in India, according to air quality technology company <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=most+pulluted+cities+on+earth&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS942US942&amp;oq=most+pulluted+cities+on+earth&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i10l9.7304j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">IQAir</a>, and much of those emissions are due to transportation.</p>
<p>By offering two separate products for diesel-powered or electric rickshaws – the retrofit kit, which Harris said will fit over 90% of current models, and the “eZee” swappable battery – Power Global is aiming to capture almost the entire auto-rickshaw market.</p>
<p>Harris says the company already has around 48 dealers ready to sell their products, thanks largely to Power Global co-founder Pankaj Dubey’s extensive history working with Indian dealerships over his career with Hero Motors, Yamaha, and Polaris. And that’s a real benefit, because much of Power Global’s plan is dependent upon an extensive dealer network that can get people signed up to the swappable battery subscription model and help drivers buy and install the retrofit kits.</p>
<p>The main source of revenue will come from getting drivers on the energy-as-a-service monthly subscription model via Power Global’s “eZee” swappable batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It&#8217;s a totally different business model,” Harris said. “We can&#8217;t translate petrol or gas solutions and try and make that work for electric, it&#8217;s really a whole new thing. Our viewpoint is: a lot of kiosks, a small amount of [battery] modules per location.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2195777" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2195777" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2195777" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eZee-module.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eZee-module.jpg 7952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eZee-module.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eZee-module.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eZee-module.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eZee-module.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eZee-module.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eZee-module.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/eZee-module.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2195777" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.power.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Power Global <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The company wants to launch on the outskirts of New Delhi, National Capital Region to start, with the eventual goal of planning a kiosk every three kilometers or so. Drivers will also have the option to take the battery home and charge it using a Power Global home charger.</p>
<p>On the user side, the company’s also developing an app that will allow drivers to see stats like how many kilometers they’ve traveled that day, their remaining battery life and where they can find the nearest battery swapping kiosk.</p>
<p>Power Global expects its batteries to last four and a half to five years. The company plans to use the batteries for stationary energy storage application once they&#8217;re taken out of the eZee ecosystem. Harris said there are plans to eventually tie those batteries in with small solar panels to provide energy to rural areas. Once the battery has been completely depleted of all its useful life, Harris said it’ll be sent to a recycler.</p>
<p>The company aims to release its eZee swappable battery product in the first quarter of next year, followed by the retrofit kits. It has opened a battery production plant in Greater Noida, India, which it anticipates will produce about a gigawatt-hour – which is about 10,000 Model S packs –this time next year. That’ll make it one of the largest domestic manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries in the country. By the end of 2022, Power Global aims to have at least 10,000 vehicles on the eZee swappable system.</p>
<p>While Power Global is in discussion with some U.S.-based companies interested in the eZee product, Harris said the focus is ultimately further east. “Do we really need another solution for the top 10% of the world? No, we don&#8217;t. Let&#8217;s focus on the other 90% of the world and actually make a difference.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The scale of the tech industry&#8217;s spending to influence the European Union&#8217;s tech policy agenda has been laid out in a <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/The%20lobby%20network%20-%20Big%20Tech%27s%20web%20of%20influence%20in%20the%20EU.pdf">report</a> published today by Corporate Europe Observatory and Lobbycontrol &#8212; which found hundreds of companies, groups and business associations shelling out a total of €97 million (~$115M) annually lobbying EU institutions.</p>
<p>The level of spending makes tech the biggest lobby sector in the region &#8212; ahead of pharma, fossil fuels, finance, and chemicals &#8212; per the report by the two lobbying transparency campaign groups.</p>
<p>The EU has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">a raft of digital legislation in train</a>, including the Digital Markets Act, which is set to apply ex ante controls to the biggest &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; platforms to promote fair competition in the digital market by outlawing a range of abusive practices; and the Digital Services Act, which will increase requirements on a swathe of digital businesses &#8212; again with greater requirements for larger platforms &#8212; to try to bring online rules in line with offline requirements in areas like illegal content and products.</p>

<p>Tackling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">online disinformation</a> and threats to democratic processes &#8212; such as by updating the EU&#8217;s rules for political ads running online and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">tighter regulation of online ad targeting more generally</a> is also being eyed by Brussels-based lawmakers.</p>
<p>The bloc is also in the process of agreeing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">risk-based framework for applications of artificial intelligence</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">Data reuse</a> is another big EU regulatory focus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, enforcement of the EU&#8217;s existing data protection framework (GDPR) &#8212; which is widely perceived to have been (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/eu-hits-amazon-with-record-breaking-887m-gdpr-fine-over-data-misuse/">mostly</a>) weakly applied against tech giants &#8212; is another area where tech giants may be keen to influence regional policy, given that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">uniformly vigorous enforcement</a> could threaten the surveillance-based business models of online ad giants like Google and Facebook.</p>
<p>Instead, multiple GDPR complaints against the pair are still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">sitting undecided on the desk of Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission</a>.</p>
<p>A small number of tech giants dominant EU lobbying, according to the report, which found ten companies are responsible for almost a third of the total spend &#8212; namely: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Huawei, Amazon, IBM, Intel, Qualcomm and Vodafone &#8212; who collectively spend more than €32M a year to try to influence EU tech policy.</p>
<p>Google topped the lobbying list of Big Tech big spenders in the EU &#8212; spending €5.8M annually trying to influence EU institutions, per the report; followed by Facebook (€5.5M); Microsoft (€5.3M); Apple (€3.5M); and Huawei (€3M).</p>

Unsurprisingly, US-based tech companies dominate industry lobbying in the EU &#8212; with the report finding a fifth of the companies lobbying the bloc on digital policy are US-based &#8212; although it suggests the true proportion is &#8220;likely even higher&#8221;.</p>
<p>While China (or Hong Kong) based companies were only found to comprise less than one per cent of the total, suggesting Chinese tech firms are so far not invested in EU lobbying at anywhere near the level of their US counterparts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lobbying surrounding proposals for a Digital Services pack, the EU’s attempt at reining in Big Tech, provides the perfect example of how the firms’ immense budget provides them with privileged access: Commission high-level officials held 271 meetings, 75 percent of them with industry lobbyists. Google and Facebook led the pack,&#8221; write the pair of transparency campaign groups.</p>
<p>The report also shines a light on how the tech industry routinely relies upon astroturfing to push favored policies &#8212; with tech companies not only lobbying individually but also being collectively organised into a network of business and trade associations that the report dubs &#8220;important lobby actors&#8221; too.</p>
<p>Per the report, business associations lobbying on behalf of Big Tech alone have a lobbying budget that &#8220;far surpasses that of the bottom 75 per cent of the companies in the digital industry&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such a structure can allow the wealthiest tech giants to push preferred policy positions under a guise of wider industry support &#8212; by also shelling out to fund such associations which then gives them an outsized influence over their lobbying output.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Tech’s lobbying also relies on its funding of a wide network of third parties, including think tanks, SME and startup associations and law and economic consultancies to push through its messages. These links are often not disclosed, obfuscating potential biases and conflicts of interest,&#8221; the pair note, going on to highlight 14 think tanks and NGOs they found to have &#8220;close ties&#8221; to Big Tech firms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ethics and practice of these policy organisations varies but some seem to have played a particularly active role in discussions surrounding the Digital Services pack, hosting exclusive or skewed debates on behalf of their funders or publishing scaremongering reports,&#8221; they continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s an opacity problem here: Big Tech firms have fared poorly in declaring their funding of think tanks – mostly only disclosing these links after being pressured. And even still this disclosure is not complete. To this, Big Tech adds its funding of SME and startup associations; and the fact that law and economic experts hired by Big Tech also participate in policy discussions, often without disclosing their clients or corporate links.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 14 think tanks and NGOs the report links to Big Tech backers are: CERRE; CDI, EPC, CEPS, CER, Bruegel, Lisbon Council, CDT, TPN, Friends of Europe, ECIPE, European Youth Forum, German Marshall Fund and the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies.</p>
<p>The biggest spending tech giants were contacted for comment on the report. We&#8217;ll update this article with any response.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>A Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Like other companies who work with European institutions, we detail our work in the EU transparency register and we have clear policies in place to protect the independence of the people and organisations we sponsor, including a requirement to disclose funding.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft also sent a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The European Union has been and remains an important stakeholder for Microsoft. We seek to be a constructive and transparent partner to European policymakers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We also reached out to the European Commission for comment.</p>
<p>A Commission spokesman told us: &#8220;The criticism misses the point that the EU is regulating tech, faster and more thoroughly than any other democratic part of the world &#8212; first with the GDPR, and now with our DSA / DMA proposals, as well as with our proposals on AI and data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also when it comes to transparency, the Commission has been uncompromising in delivering the highest standards of transparency &#8212; on who we meet and on who seeks to influence us. We have led by example and have been applying the “no registration, no meeting” rule for years now. This means that only those singed up to the Transparency Register can meet with our key decision-makers. Information those meetings is published online and available for anyone to have a look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission is open to meeting anyone who wishes to speak to us,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The Commission does not, and will not control who requests meetings, nor how often. It is also not for the Commission to explain or comment on lobbying strategies of the different companies and interest representatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission spokesman also defended the outreach process it has engaged with on the DSA and DMA proposals specifically &#8212; pointing out that the public consultation ran from June to September and garnered approaching 3,000 replies (2k of which were from citizens) &#8212; adding: &#8220;<span lang="EN-GB">The European Commission services in charge of drafting and negotiating these regulations have taken extra care to engage with civil society actors, NGOs, and consumer organisations &#8212; at all stages of the proposal. All legitimate stakeholders have been granted sufficient access by the European Commission to have their voices heard before the regulation proposal was finalised, in line with the Better Regulation guidelines. The negotiation team continues to be in regular exchanges with civil society actors and consumer organisations. Let me also point you to the fact that as always, the Commission organised broad consultations in preparation of its proposals on platform regulation.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/final-vote-delayed-for-koreas-plan-to-ban-google-and-apple-in-app-payment-rules/">After a number of delays</a>, South Korea’s National Assembly today voted to approve the passage of its “Anti-Google law.” Nicknamed after the search giant but more wide-ranging, the law will prevent Google and Apple from forcing developers to use their in-app billing systems when building apps for their two market-dominating app stores .</p>
<p>This is the first time globally that a government has intervened to prevent Google and Apple from imposing their own payment rails on in-app purchases.</p>
<p>Google and Apple have been increasingly under scrutiny over the restrictive aspects of their respective systems in other market, and so now many will be looking to see if the move in South Korea becomes a tipping point, where the two might be subjected to similar measures in other countries. Most imminently, Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is also considering regulations for digital payments system of Apple, Google and WeChat, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-considering-new-laws-apple-google-wechat-digital-wallets-2021-08-30/">according to media reports.</a></p>
<p>South Korea’s preliminary committee voted on Wednesday, 25 August to proceed with the revised Telecommunication Business Act, seeking to restrict Google and Apple from charging app developer’s commission on in-app purchases.</p>
<p>Since August 2020, lawmakers in South Korea have proposed bills to prohibit the global tech companies from wielding their dominance in the app payment market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">Google in March 2021 reduced its commission to 15%</a> from an original 30% for all in-app purchases to appease app developers. But four months later, it announced that it will push back its new in-app billing system to March 2022.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">Apple in August proposed a settlement in a lawsuit filed</a> against it by software developers in the US that notes Apple will allow app developers to direct their payment options outside of their iOS app or the App Store, although it didn&#8217;t go as far as allowing developers to include alternative methods of payment within app themselves.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple said in its statement, &#8220;the proposed Telecommunications Business Act will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases, and features like &#8216;Ask to Buy&#8217; and Parental Controls will become less effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google could not be reached.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://loftyinccapital.vc/">LoftyInc Capital</a>, a pan-African VC firm, announced today that it is launching its third fund &#8212; LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund 3 &#8212; at $10 million for tech startups in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm has reached the first close of $5.5 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the limited partners in the vehicle include those from its second fund, FBNQuest Funds, syndicates from The Green Investment Club, HNIs from multinationals like Google, Facebook, and ExxonMobil; and Andela CEO Jeremy Johnson, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, LoftyInc has written checks to over 20 startups since it began raising money for the fund. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They cut across various industries like e-commerce, fintech, healthcare, logistics, and media in different regions within and outside Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Francophone Africa, the company has invested in Afrikrea and Star News Mobile. Then in Omnibiz, RXAll, Sudo Africa, Tech Advance, Aladdin, Flex Finance, Star Kitchens Group, and EPump across West Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For LoftyInc&#8217;s portfolio in North Africa, there&#8217;s Odiggo, Illa, Tagaddod, and Instadiet. Akiba Digital, Beamm, and Zazu Africa make up LoftyInc&#8217;s portfolio in South Africa, while Cashback and Dash are the startups funded in East Africa. LoftyInc also has Diasporan interests in OjaExpress and FitMatch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LoftyInc runs three funds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simultaneously. The second fund, which is its first formal VC fund, is largely focused on Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On the other hand, this third fund follows the thesis of LoftyInc&#8217;s first fund: investing in startups across different markets and sectors in Africa and the diaspora. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund says it wants to take big bets on markets outside the Big Four &#8212; Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Operating three funds</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A month ago, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/one-of-nigerias-high-profile-angel-investors-is-launching-a-fund-for-african-startups/">covered one of Africa&#8217;s most important angel investors Olumide Soyombo</a>. He is one of the few giants in a game that includes LoftyInc founder and general partner <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/belloidris">Idris Bello</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bello likes to describe his 12-year venture into technology and entrepreneurship as an &#8220;Afropreneurship journey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in business school in the U.S, he realized that the next wave of innovation that Africa as a continent needed rested on the shoulders&#8217; of up-and-coming founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, Bello started</span><a href="https://loftyincltd.biz/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">LoftyInc Allied Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside other entrepreneurs as an enterprise development company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spun off a technology hub and venture accelerator called Wennovation Hub and also the venture arm called LoftyInc Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, the firm launched the first fund &#8212; LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund 1 &#8212; as its pre-seed stage investment vehicle. The fund act more like a syndicate or an angel group of which investors includes senior executives in key industries across Africa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years later, as the founding partner, Bello teamed up with a long-time advisor Marsha Wulff, an early investor in healthtech company Teladoc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They launched the second fund,</span><a href="https://loftyinccapital.vc/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund 2</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside Michael Oluwagbemi, who also acts as a general partner at the firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2017 to 2020, LoftyInc wrote checks worth over $1.2 million in nine rounds to six </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian startups &#8212; Printivo, RelianceHMO, Epump, YouVerify, Shyft Power Solutions, and Flutterwave (at pre-Series A)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave serves as LoftyInc&#8217;s first exit, one which Bello said returned 3x to its LPs. It was this successful exit that laid the foundation for the third fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we exited our Flutterwave stake in February, our LPs wanted us to raise and put together another fund because we made returns for them. At first, we wanted to do a $2.5 million fund but after making enquiries from LPs, it rose to $4 million. Then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decided to make it $10 million, so we could invest in more startups,&#8221; Bello said to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when you look at Bello&#8217;s status in the African tech ecosystem and what similar Africa-focused funds are raising these days, one may wonder why the investor isn&#8217;t raising more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His answer to that:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I always say this &#8212; my approach is very different. I&#8217;m quite organic which is evident in how we moved from a group of angels to LPs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once you get up to $50m to $100m, your problem becomes good deployment, especially in Africa. And what I&#8217;m doing is to build a smaller base to a pyramid so when I&#8217;m raising a large fund, it won&#8217;t be a problem deploying the funds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another point he makes has to do with the limited partners involved. Most of the firm&#8217;s LPs in this third fund hold C-suite and managerial positions in banks and other multinationals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bello argues that if Fund 3 can make good on its promise to make fantastic returns for these individual LPs, it will be a no brainer to onboard the institutions they work with for a bigger fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to build an ecosystem of African investors. After that, we&#8217;ll start building up the institutions to also partake in making investments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LoftyInc has a robust deal flow and views about 30 decks per week, according to Bello. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says the fund receives this much flow because the founders of portfolio startups are the firm&#8217;s strongest source of proprietary deals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And that&#8217;s what he thinks differentiates LoftyInc from other VC firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, in a brief chat with TechCrunch, Andela CEO Jeremy Johnson mentioned that before anyone knew about his startup, LoftyInc already backed him</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And to him, it only makes sense to do the same by sourcing deals and investing in the fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the firm, via its first fund, also has an extensive investor base of African origin who live in and outside the continent. Per Bello, this angel network double as venture scouts for the firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We usually invest before any major investor does, hold the hand of new founders, source their initial clients within our large portfolio of over 65 African startups and our large African-based angel and LP network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We also provide meaningful introductions to regulators, partners, mentors, top hires and experienced board directors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, founders want us in their deals because they have seen us attract both early and later-stage investors to prior ventures.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what LoftyInc looks for in companies it invests in, there&#8217;s a bias towards those who go for a large market with little or no competition, a product that users love, and execution</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with most VC firms out there, LoftyInc claims to be sector agnostic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there&#8217;s some affinity towards startups playing in the IoT, fintech and healthtech space, Bello said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LoftyInc&#8217;s first fund, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> catered to by angel investors, is most bullish at the pre-seed stage. This year alone, the group has done over 50 pre-seed deals. For the others, the focus is on seed to Series A deals with an average ticket size of $250,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While LoftyInc&#8217;s target for Fund 3 is $10 million, Bello tells TechCrunch that the firm is hoping to achieve a final close above that figure before the end of Q4 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
