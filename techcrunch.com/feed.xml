										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Haven&#8217;t you heard that Instagram is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQwNfFBJr5A/">no longer a photo-sharing app</a>? Today, Instagram announced that users can now upload 60-second videos on Reels, the platform&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">TikTok competitor</a>.</p>
<p>This update also adds functionality for a captions sticker on Reels, which transcribes audio to text. Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/instagram-adds-a-captions-option-for-stories-and-soon-reels/">previously teased</a> this sticker for Reels when they added it to Stories, making the platform more accessible for Deaf or hard of hearing users, as well as people who want to use the app without sound. Right now, the caption sticker is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, but Instagram says they plan to expand to additional countries and languages soon. TikTok already has a similar feature.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reels. up to 60 secs. starting today. <a href="https://t.co/pKWIqtoXU2">pic.twitter.com/pKWIqtoXU2</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Instagram (@instagram) <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1420038313772150785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Previously, Instagram only supported Reels of up to 30 seconds, while TikTok recently made it possible for users to create videos up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/">three minutes long</a>. Still, the ability to post 60-second reels is especially useful for creators who want to re-post their existing content from TikTok or other competitor apps to grow their following across multiple platforms. More creators are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/a-bank-for-the-creator-economy-karat-raises-26m-in-series-a-funding/">making a living on social media</a> than ever, but with so many platforms available to them (even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">Pinterest is investing</a> in short-form video), it&#8217;s smart to cross-post content. So, this feature benefits Instagram creators who also have a following on TikTok, but it makes sense for the platform itself as well &#8212; the more eyes on Reels, the better. Instagram&#8217;s algorithm doesn&#8217;t promote content with a TikTok watermark, but savvy users have figured out how to recycle their videos without it.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/youtube-expands-tiktok-rival-shorts-to-the-uk-canada-latin-america-lets-users-tap-all-of-youtube-for-tunes/">YouTube Shorts</a> and Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a> also support videos of up to 60 seconds. In May, YouTube Shorts launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">$100 million creator fund</a> to distribute among top Shorts creators over the course of 2021 and 2022; Snapchat distributed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">$1 million per day</a> to viral Spotlight creators between its launch at the end of November through the end of 2020. Facebook and Instagram have also committed to <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/investing-in-content-creators-facebook-instagram">investing in digital creators</a>.</p>
<p>To access this feature, navigate to create a new Reel, then press the down button on the left side of the screen to reveal the menu. Tap &#8220;length&#8221; to toggle among options to create a 15-second, 30-second, or 60-second Reel. Not all creators have access to 60-second Reels just yet, but it should roll out to all users soon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The NBA’s Chicago Bulls launched its first-ever NFTs –– including digital artwork of NBA championship rings –– by launching an online store on Shopify.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shopify has made it possible for eligible sellers to sell NFTs (non-fungible tokens) via its platform, which opens up a whole new world for e-commerce merchants.</p>
<p>On Monday, the NBA’s Chicago Bulls launched its first-ever NFTs –– including digital artwork of NBA championship rings –– by launching an<a href="https://nft.bulls.com/"> online store on Shopify</a>. Instead of having to go to an NFT marketplace, Bulls fans can now purchase the digital art directly with the team’s online store using a credit or debit card. In its first day of making them available, the NBA team sold out of the NFTs within just 90 seconds, according to Kaz Nejatian, Shopify’s VP of merchant services.</p>
<p>“You could buy NFTs on credit cards before, but honestly the NFT buying experience outside Shopify isn’t awesome for anyone right now,” he told TechCrunch “That’s why we decided to do this work. Merchants and buyers shouldn’t have to take a course in crypto to buy things they care about.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s also about giving consumers more options to buy NFTs – especially those who are not well-versed in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>By making it possible for merchants to sell NFTs directly through their Shopify storefronts, the company says it’s creating access for merchants who want to sell NFTs. They will eventually be able to choose which blockchain they’d like to sell on based on their products and customer base since Shopify supports multiple blockchains, Nejatian said.</p>
<p>“By contrast, if merchants want to sell on an NFT marketplace, they need to choose based on the blockchain supported by that marketplace,” he added.</p>
<p>The Chicago Bulls selected the Flow blockchain for their NFTs, for example. But overall, Shopify merchants can today choose from Flow and Ethereum, but soon &#8220;will have more choice with other blockchains on Shopify,&#8221; according to Nejatian.</p>
<p>The move was also driven by demand from merchants asking for the ability to sell NFTs and the desire to give creators and artists another forum to grow professionally.</p>
<p>“Many creators are already seeing the value of selling NFTs to their fans, but we’re removing some of the friction for themselves and their buyers, allowing them to better monetize their work and their connection to their audience,” he added. “We’re opening up a world where their fans feel meaningful connection to their brands, and where NFTs just increasingly become part of how we buy and sell online.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-google-tv-brings-streaming-apps-live-tv-and-search-into-a-single-interface/">last fall&#8217;s debut of Google TV</a>, the new user interface for Chromecast devices, Google is today giving its Google TV companion app for Android a makeover. The updated version of the mobile app for Google TV includes an updated user interface, expanded set recommendations, and more TV and movies to watch.</p>
<p>The app in earlier days was known as &#8220;Google Play Movies &amp; TV&#8221; (whew!) but rebranded to just &#8220;Google TV&#8221; alongside the changes that rolled out to Chromecast in September. Here, users can browse over 700,000 movie and TV episodes from across top streaming apps, find new things to watch, and rent or purchase movies and shows, including new releases.</p>
<p>Now, Google is updating the app&#8217;s look-and-feel with new 16:9 widescreen movie and show posters which it says will give the app a more &#8220;cinematic&#8221; look.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2182602" style="width: 345px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182602" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2182602" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1.-GTV-Mobile-_For-You_-NEW.png?w=335" alt="" width="335" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1.-GTV-Mobile-_For-You_-NEW.png 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1.-GTV-Mobile-_For-You_-NEW.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1.-GTV-Mobile-_For-You_-NEW.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1.-GTV-Mobile-_For-You_-NEW.png?resize=768,1560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1.-GTV-Mobile-_For-You_-NEW.png?resize=335,680 335w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1.-GTV-Mobile-_For-You_-NEW.png?resize=756,1536 756w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1.-GTV-Mobile-_For-You_-NEW.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182602" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, it&#8217;s adding the Rotten Tomatoes scores directly under each poster to help users make decisions about what they want to watch next. You can also visit a movie or TV show&#8217;s details page and mark it as &#8220;watched&#8221; in order to improve the app&#8217;s recommendations. This will allow Google TV to make further recommendations based on your watch history, and could be helpful if you&#8217;re not a regular app user to start tailoring its suggestions to your interests. However, the feature won&#8217;t help you keep up with your progress in a show, as the Reelgood or TV Time apps allow for, as you can&#8217;t mark individual episodes as watched, only entire series.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4bEJEAP4aA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-google-tv-brings-streaming-apps-live-tv-and-search-into-a-single-interface/">The new Google TV brings streaming apps, live TV and search into a single interface</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The new Google TV brings streaming apps, live TV and search into a single interface&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-google-tv-brings-streaming-apps-live-tv-and-search-into-a-single-interface/embed/#?secret=4bEJEAP4aA" data-secret="4bEJEAP4aA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The recommendations are another feature that&#8217;s been improved with the latest release to be more aligned with what you&#8217;d see with the TV experience. In addition to featuring more rows of personalized suggestions to browse through, the app&#8217;s recommendation system will now be based on what you&#8217;ve watched in the past, your interests from your Google account, and trending and popular content in your region. Trending recommendations are sourced from what&#8217;s popular or trending across Google products, what&#8217;s being mentioned across the web, as well as hand-picked selections from human editors. For instance, you could see recommendations that suggest &#8220;summer blockbusters,&#8221; or other timely suggestions.</p>
<p>Users will also now see new movie and how recommendations as new content is released from services they subscribe to.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182603" style="width: 345px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182603" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2182603" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2.-Manage-Services.png?w=335" alt="" width="335" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2.-Manage-Services.png 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2.-Manage-Services.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2.-Manage-Services.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2.-Manage-Services.png?resize=768,1560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2.-Manage-Services.png?resize=335,680 335w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2.-Manage-Services.png?resize=756,1536 756w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2.-Manage-Services.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182603" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The app has also expanded its content lineup by adding new providers like Discovery+, Viki, Cartoon Network, PBS Kids, and Boomerang, as well as on-demand content from live TV services, including of course, YouTube TV, as well as Philo and fuboTV. These providers were previously unavailable for search and discovery inside the mobile app, following the platform update in the fall.</p>
<p>Google said during its I/O Developer conference in May that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/android-tv-os-reaches-80m-monthly-active-devices-adds-new-features/">Android TV OS had reached an install base of 80 million monthly active devices</a>, but it didn&#8217;t break down how many consumers streamed on through the Roku and Fire TV rival, Google TV for Chromecast, which is powered by Android TV OS under-the-hood. Instead, Google combined that figure with the numerous Android TV OS-powered devices on the market that include those offered by other streaming device brand partners and TV service providers &#8212; meaning the number included operator-tier and set-top boxes, too, which is a different type of market.</p>
<p>The company said the new features are available now on the Google TV Android app in the U.S. but couldn&#8217;t offer a timeline for other platforms or an international expansion.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Apple News on Monday announced a collaboration with NBCUniversal to develop exclusive daily recaps and audio briefings, event schedules and medal counts to help fans keep tabs on the games.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s hard to keep up with the Olympics any year, let alone when they&#8217;re taking place in a time zone that&#8217;s 13 hours ahead of you (if you&#8217;re on the U.S. East Coast). Apple News on Monday announced a collaboration with NBCUniversal (the U.S. broadcast rights holder for the Olympics) to develop exclusive daily recaps and audio briefings, event schedules and medal counts to help fans keep tabs on the games.</p>
<p>NBC Sports is the go-to app for streaming any Olympic event, but it&#8217;s a bit buggy. To their credit, streaming so many different feeds at once is hard to pull off, but the app can be tricky to navigate. Even though the app has an impressive catalog of every event, there&#8217;s no easy way to catch up with all the triumphs and defeats that took place while half the world was asleep, so this collaboration with Apple News fills a necessary void in NBC&#8217;s existing offerings.</p>

<p>One of the most useful features is the News app&#8217;s user-friendly schedule of every single Olympic event by sport, which can set calendar reminders for the events you can&#8217;t miss. (Though you might need to set your alarm for certain events, like the women&#8217;s gymnastics all-around final, which starts at 6:50 a.m. ET on Thursday. But don&#8217;t worry, for these highly anticipated events, there&#8217;ll be prime-time coverage, too). NBC Sports sends push notification reminders for sports that you choose, but a pre-set calendar event might be more useful for planning your evening (or early morning) Olympics viewing.</p>
<p>Of course, this partnership allows Apple to promote Apple Podcasts, which has more competition than ever as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">Spotify continues to grow</a> and Facebook adds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">support for podcasts</a>. NBC is pushing its Olympics podcasts like &#8220;The Podium&#8221; and &#8220;On Her Turf&#8221; pretty hard &#8212; &#8220;The Podium&#8221; often appears as a banner ad during live coverage on the web. Even though these shows aren&#8217;t exclusive to Apple, the partnership with NBC can only help drive traffic to their podcast platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three digits, so little time.</p>
<p>Numbers can take on profound cultural significance, but few numbers have quite the resonance as 911, the emergency number for the United States. Few want to dial it, but when they must, it works — every single time. <a href="https://www.nena.org/page/911Statistics">One industry trade association</a> estimates that 240 million 911 phone calls are made every year, ranging from the quotidian loud dog to the exceptional terrorist attack.</p>
<p>While it may be a singular number, 911 calls are directed to roughly 5,700 public safety answering points (PSAPs) across the country, all with independent operations, variegated equipment, disparate software, multifarious organizational structures, and vast inequalities of staffing and resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every 911 center is very different and they are as diverse and unique as the communities that they serve,&#8221; Karin Marquez, who we will meet later, put it. You have massive urban centers with dozens of staffers and the best equipment, and &#8220;you have agencies in rural America that have one person working 24/7 and they’re there to answer three calls a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>These organizations face a tough challenge: Transitioning their systems to incorporate information from billions of new consumer devices into the heart of 911 response. Location from mobile GPS, medical information from health profiles, video footage from cameras — all of this could be useful when police, firefighters and paramedics arrive on a scene. But how do you connect hundreds of tech companies to a myriad of 911 technology providers?</p>
<p>Over the last eight years, <b>RapidSOS</b> has become the go-to solution for addressing this problem. With more than $190 million raised, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform/">including an $85 million round this past February</a>, <a href="https://rapidsos.com">RapidSOS</a> now covers nearly 5,000 PSAPs and processes more than 150 million emergencies every year, and it’s technology is almost certainly integrated into the smartphone you’re carrying and many of the devices you have lying around (the company counts about 350 million connected devices with its software).</p>
<p>Yet, like many emergencies, the company’s story is one of reverses, misdirections and urgency as its founders worked to find a model to jump-start 911 response. RapidSOS may well be the only startup to pivot from a consumer app to a govtech/enterprise hybrid, and it has the most extensive directory of partnerships and integration relationships of any startup I have ever seen. Now, as it expands to Mexico, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, this startup with its roots in a rural farm in Indiana, is redefining emergency response globally for the 21st Century.</p>
<p>The lead writer of this EC-1 is <b>Danny Crichton</b>. In addition to being the EC-1 series editor, managing editor at TechCrunch, and regularly talking about himself in the third person, Danny has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">writing about disaster tech</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/03/rapidsos/">first covered RapidSOS back in 2015</a> prior to its public launch. The lead editor for this story was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, and illustrations were drawn by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><em>RapidSOS had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Crichton has no financial ties to RapidSOS, and <a href="https://www.dannycrichton.com/ethics/">his ethics disclosure statement is available here</a>.</em></p>
<p>The RapidSOS EC-1 comprises four articles numbering 12,400 words and a reading time of 50 minutes. Here are the topics we’ll be dialing into:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part 1: Origin story</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-origin/">Smoking pizza ovens and pilfered dollar bills, or the early story of RapidSOS</a>” (2,700 words/11 minutes) — explores the early years of RapidSOS and the company’s pivot from consumer app to govtech and integrated services for technology and device companies.</li>
<li><b>Part 2: Product and business</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-business/">RapidSOS learned that the best product design is sometimes no product design</a>” (3,700 words/15 minutes) —analyzes how RapidSOS made its pivot and why its current business model has performed so well.</li>
<li><b>Part 3: Partnerships</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-partnerships/">How RapidSOS used creative tactics to build partnerships and a BD engine at scale</a>” (4,000 words/16 minutes) —investigates how RapidSOS has built up so many dozens of corporate and individual partnerships in its quest to transform 911.</li>
<li><b>Part 4: Next-generation 911</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-future/">After a decade, Congress might finally bring 911 into the internet age</a>” (2,000 words/8 minutes) —looks at the future of 911 after a decade of stagnation and limited funding from Capitol Hill as well as the future prospects of RapidSOS.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[RapidSOS' story is one of a mission, a community, a team and a dream that every emergency should have the best chance to be resolved as positively as possible.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The irony of 911 is that it’s a number that everyone knows (at least in the United States), and yet, no one really <i>thinks</i> about it. Few of us will dial 911 more than a handful of times in our lives, and even when we do, we will meet the police officers and paramedics who respond, never the 911 call taker who handled the dispatch. These systems and the people behind them garner meager attention, whether from Congress, state legislatures, the public or anyone else outside the emergency response community.</p>
<p>Except, that is, for Michael Martin.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			RapidSOS&#8217; story is one of a mission, a community, a team and a dream that every emergency should have the best chance to be resolved as positively as possible.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>He, along with Nick Horelik and Matt Bozik very early on, became fascinated by the complexity and lack of innovation in the sector. &#8220;Uber had just come out. I could press a button and get a car. Why can’t I just press a button and get an ambulance? And then it sparks this curiosity,&#8221; Martin said. He sought knowledge, but for such a critical system, information was sparse. &#8220;The Wikipedia article on George Clooney is way longer than the one on 911,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>So began a nearly decade-long journey with RapidSOS that would see Martin and his team first attempt to build a consumer-safety app called Haven before pivoting exclusively to helping dozens of tech companies, including Apple and Google and device companies like SiriusXM, connect to a myriad of 911 software vendors. Along the way, they experienced the full vagaries of startup life, frenetically pivoting from product to product as they tried to get consumers to even <i>care</i> about emergencies.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy, and it took years before the company finally hit its stride. But RapidSOS&#8217;s story is one of a mission, a community, a team and a dream that every emergency should have the best chance to be resolved as positively as possible.</p>
<h2 id="Indiana: the callroads of America">Indiana: The callroads of America</h2>
<p>Martin grew up outside the rural town of Rockport, Indiana, population about 2,500 today. His mother was the local doctor, and he and his brother habituated to the openness and ennui of rural farming life. “We grew up on 35 acres of land; we had an enormous garden and a little hobby orchard and stuff like that,” he said. &#8220;We had ‘Drive-Your-Tractor-To-School Day.'&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For the founders of RapidSOS, improving the quality of emergency response by adding useful data, like location, to 911 calls was an inspiring objective, and one that garnered widespread support.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sometimes, the best missions are the hardest to fund.</p>
<p>For the founders of RapidSOS, improving the quality of emergency response by adding useful data, like location, to 911 calls was an inspiring objective, and one that garnered widespread support. There was just one problem: How would they create a viable business?</p>
<p>The roughly 5,700 public safety answering points (PSAPs) in America weren’t great contenders. Cash-strapped and highly decentralized, 911 centers already spent their meager budgets on staffing and maintaining decades-old equipment, and they had few resources to improve their systems. Plus, appropriations bills in Congress to modernize centers have languished for more than a decade, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-future/">a topic we’ll explore more in part four of this EC-1</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Who would pay? Who was annoyed enough with America’s antiquated 911 system to be willing to shell out dollars to fix it?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>People obviously desire better emergency services — after all, they are the ones who will dial 911 and demand help someday. Yet, they never think about emergencies until they actually happen, as RapidSOS learned from the poor adoption of its Haven app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-origin/">we discussed in part one</a>. People weren’t ready to pay a monthly subscription for these services in advance.</p>
<p>So, who would pay? Who was annoyed enough with America’s antiquated 911 system to be willing to shell out dollars to fix it?</p>
<p>Ultimately, the company iterated itself into essentially an API layer between the thousands of PSAPs on one side and developers of apps and consumer devices on the other. These developers wanted to include safety features in their products, but didn’t want to engineer hundreds of software integrations across thousands of disparate agencies. RapidSOS’ business model thus became offering free software to 911 call centers while charging tech companies to connect through its platform.</p>
<p>It was a tough road and a classic chicken-and-egg problem. Without call center integrations, tech companies wouldn’t use the API — it was essentially useless in that case. Call centers, for their part, didn’t want to use software that didn’t offer any immediate value, even if it was being given away for free.</p>
<p>This is the story of how RapidSOS just plowed ahead against those headwinds from 2017 onward, ultimately netting itself hundreds of millions in venture funding, thousands of call agency clients, dozens of revenue deals with the likes of Apple, Google and Uber, and partnerships with more software integrators than any startup has any right to secure. Smart product decisions, a carefully calibrated business model and tenacity would eventually lend the company the escape velocity to not just expand across America, but increasingly across the world as well.</p>
<p>In this second part of the EC-1, I’ll analyze RapidSOS’ current product offerings and business strategy, explore the company’s pivot from consumer app to embedded technology and take a look at its nascent but growing international expansion efforts. It offers key lessons on the importance of iterating, how to secure the right customer feedback and determining the best product strategy.</p>
<h2 id="The 311 on a 911 API">The 411 on a 911 API</h2>
<p>It became clear from the earliest stages of RapidSOS’ journey that getting data into the 911 center would be its first key challenge. The entire 911 system — even today in most states — is built for voice and not data.</p>
<p>Karin Marquez, senior director of public safety at RapidSOS, who we met in the introduction, worked for decades at a PSAP near Denver, working her way up from call taker to a senior supervisor. “When I started, it was a one-man dispatch center. So, I was working alone, I was answering 911 calls, non-emergency calls, dispatching police, fire and EMS,” she said.</p>

<p>As a 911 call taker, her very first requirement for every call was figuring out where an emergency is taking place — even before characterizing what is happening. “Everything starts with location,” she said. “If I don’t know where you are, I can’t send you help. Everything else we can kind of start to build our house on. Every additional data [point] will help to give us a better understanding of what that emergency is, who may be involved, what kind of vehicle they’re involved in — but if I don’t have an address, I can’t send you help.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our Extra Crunch Live series continues with some heavy hitters in August, including Jen Nwankwo, founder and CEO at 1910 Genetics, and Playground Global general partner Jory Bell. They&#8217;ll be with us live on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-playground-global-and-1910-genetics">August 11 at 12 p.m. PT (3 p.m. ET)</a> to tell us all about how Nwankwo and her startup won over Bell and Playground as an investor, and as we do every week on Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll conduct a live pitch feedback session featuring you, the members of our audience.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live gives you the chance to hear live from entrepreneurs who have successfully raised significant rounds of venture capital &#8212; and from the investors who believed in them. We go into detail about how the deal got done, and you&#8217;ll hear from both about what it takes to pitch VCs and what industry-leading VCs look for in prospective portfolio companies.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to have Nwankwo and Bell joining us for this episode. Nwankwo founded and leads 1910 Genetics, which takes advantage of AI to accelerate the discovery and development of new drug therapies across a wide range of disease and condition categories. She has a Ph.D. in pharmacology and experimental therapeutics from Tufts University School of Medicine and participated in drug discovery development that led to the creation of Type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity prior to her graduate school work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bell&#8217;s career includes designing and building autonomous robots for deep-sea exploration, as well as a six-year stint at Apple designing notebooks for the consumer technology leader. Bell&#8217;s venture investment work began at Playground Global in 2015; he focuses on deep tech investments, including in aerospace, genomics, synthetic biology, and AI-assisted drug discovery, as in the case of 1910 Genetics.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where startups in the audience can virtually “raise their hand” to pitch their startup live on our stream. Our expert guests will give their feedback on each pitch. If you want to throw your hat in the ring, you have to show up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most challenging aspects of leading a startup is the seeming impossibility of building partnerships and executing business development. Large companies are sclerotic and bureaucratic, taking eons in terms of startup years to make decisions that for them are small, but for a new company, can be life itself. Every startup ultimately needs to break through those logjams, and sometimes, they need to lock in quite a few partnerships to be successful.</p>
<p>And then there is RapidSOS. With a two-sided business built around relationships with dozens if not hundreds of companies on both sides of the coin, it needed to gain competency in building partnerships really early and really quickly as it scaled its data platform to improve emergency 911 calls. We’ve already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-origin/">covered the company’s origin story</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-business/">business</a> in parts one and two of this EC-1, and now I want to turn to the secret sauce: How a scrappy cadre of startup folks were able to break down the walls that imperil partnerships at some of the largest tech companies in the world.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For RapidSOS, which had to scale to support hundreds of partners over the years, the key has been building its team and training them for the unique partners they have signed agreements with.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The key, as we will learn, is a set of creative tactics that the company used to bind as many stakeholders into its business as possible. We’ll look at what these partnerships are and how they are formed, and then explore how RapidSOS integrated with software vendors in the 911 space. We&#8217;ll also explore how it educated call takers at public safety answering points (PSAPs), worked with its customer partners, and finally, how it built its advisory board and an industrywide initiative around health profiles to become a key thought leader in the market.</p>
<h2 id="The art of the partnership">The art of the partnership</h2>
<p>“Partnership” is a notably and intentionally vague term often thrown around startup circles. Simply put, it describes a business relationship, generally consummated with a contract or statement of work, that brings two companies together over a common initiative. Unlike a mere sale, where one company supplies a product and perhaps customer support in exchange for compensation, partnerships tend to be much broader and more strategic, and can include everything from cross-promotion and channel marketing to engineering assistance, venture investment, exclusivity commitments and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to user-interface design, 911 is about as good as it gets. It’s the “most recognized number in the United States,” Steve Souder, a prominent 911 leader, points out. Simple, fast, and it works from any telephone in the United States. No matter what the emergency is, the call takers on the other side will triage and dispatch assistance.</p>
<p>I’ve taken that ubiquity and simplicity for granted over the past three parts of this EC-1 on RapidSOS as we’ve looked at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-origin/">startup’s origin story</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-business/">business and products</a>, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1-partnerships/">its partnerships and business development engine</a>. The company is deeply enmeshed with 911, which means that the prospects of 911 as a system will heavily determine the trajectory of RapidSOS in the coming years, or at least, until its international expansion hits scale and it isn’t so dependent on the U.S. market.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Right now, a $15 billion funding bill to invest in NG911 has been proposed in Congress as part of the LIFT America infrastructure bill that is currently winding its way through the appropriations process and negotiations between Democratic and Republican leaders.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Now, you might think, “911, how could they screw that up?” But this is America, and you’d be surprised.</p>
<p>Despite the daily heroic work of tens of thousands of 911 personnel who keep this brittle system afloat, the reality today is that America’s emergency call infrastructure is in a perilous state. After more than a decade of heavy advocacy, the transition to the “next generation” of 911 (dubbed NG911), which would replace a voice-centric model with an internet-based one designed around data streams, has been trundling along, with some early traction but little universality.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/details?prodcode=R45253">a Congressional Research Service report</a> described it just a few years ago, “funding has been a challenge, and progress has been relatively slow.” Three years later, the words are just as true as they were then.</p>
<p>Given that RapidSOS’ future ultimately relies on a competent government capable of providing core infrastructure, this fourth and final part of the EC-1 will look at the current state of 911 services and what their prospects are, and finally, how one should ultimately judge RapidSOS given all that we have seen.</p>
<h2 id="The three-digit number that feels like it is three digits old">The three-digit number that feels like it is three-digits old</h2>
<p>911 was invented in the late 1960s to unify America around one emergency number. Early forays to create emergency lines had sprouted up across cities and states, but each used their own system and telephone number, creating massive complications for travelers and people living on jurisdictional boundaries. <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/archives/ncjrs/42.pdf">President Lyndon Johnson’s 1967 crime task force</a> recommended creating a single number for emergency calls as a crime-prevention tool, and on February 16, 1968, the first 911 call was dialed in Haleyville, Alabama.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After announcing that threads were on the way <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/discord-stage-discovery/">earlier this year</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/discord/status/1419721721519689733">teasing the feature on Twitter</a>, Discord is now introducing the long-requested way to make conversations in bustling servers more comprehensible.</p>
<p>Starting today, any server with &#8220;community&#8221; features enabled will be able to transform messages into threaded conversations across mobile and desktop. Threads are designated by their own subject name, making it easy to compartmentalize an off-topic idea into its own mini-conversation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182483" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182483" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182483 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/discord-threads.gif?w=600" alt="" width="600" height="338" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182483" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Discord</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/EbkxHNSVc0">pic.twitter.com/EbkxHNSVc0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Discord (@discord) <a href="https://twitter.com/discord/status/1419721721519689733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Channel members can create a thread by selecting a new hashtag symbol that now appears in the contextual menu when hovering over messages or pressing the plus sign in the chat bar and choosing &#8220;create thread.&#8221; The feature will be enabled in all servers automatically by August 17.</p>
<p>&#8220;[W]e wanted to help communities stay engaged while avoiding having to shut down conversation to maintain organization,&#8221; the company wrote in a <a href="https://blog.discord.com/connect-the-conversation-with-threads-on-discord-3f5fa8b0f6b?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">blog post</a> announcing the feature, noting that hopping into a busy new channel can &#8220;feel like walking into the middle of three different movies.&#8221; Discord introduced replies last year to help the flow of conversations; threads is an expansion of that same idea.</p>
<p>From the flow of a channel, Discord&#8217;s new threads open up into a split-view pane instead of taking over the full screen, serving their function as side conversations naturally. Threaded topics will also show up in the list of channels and will open to the full screen if selected from the channel list.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182519" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182519" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182519 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/discord-thread-plants.png?w=680" alt="Discord thread about plants" width="680" height="483" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/discord-thread-plants.png 1999w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/discord-thread-plants.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/discord-thread-plants.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/discord-thread-plants.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/discord-thread-plants.png?resize=680,483 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/discord-thread-plants.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/discord-thread-plants.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182519" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Discord</p></div></p>
<p>Threads will auto-archive after 24 hours of inactivity — a nice way to keep channels from being clogged up with off-topic or time-sensitive chats. Boosted servers can keep a thread around for a week instead of a single day, giving a channel&#8217;s members more time to hop into relevant side conversations.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8IjA9Zeong?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Servers that are boosted through Discord&#8217;s premium features will also be able to create private threads that don&#8217;t show up in the channel list. Private threads only appear to users who are manually added to them or mentioned by name within a thread.</p>
<p>Discord designed private threads so that users could hold group conversations without adding each person in the conversation as a friend, a feature that may be a boon to moderators looking to have one-on-one or small group chats more easily.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182515" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182515" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182515 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/private-thread.png?w=680" alt="Discord private thread" width="680" height="297" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/private-thread.png 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/private-thread.png?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/private-thread.png?resize=300,131 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/private-thread.png?resize=768,335 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/private-thread.png?resize=680,297 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/private-thread.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182515" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Discord</p></div></p>
<p>Moderators will also be able to designate who can create threads within a channel. Channel members can be given permissions to use private threads, manage threads or just be allowed to use public threads (&#8220;send messages&#8221; must be toggled on to allow them to create new threads). Threads will work the same way regular channels do for moderation bots.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Sony has launched its first vlogging-specific mirrorless camera, the ZV-E10, that borrows a number of features from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-zv-1-vlogging-camera-review-162822651.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">ZV-1 compact</a> vlogging model. At the same time, it&#8217;s roughly based on the A5000 and A6000-series APS-C mirrorless cameras, with all the good (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-sony-a6600-review-misstep.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">and bad</a>) that entails.</p>
<p>The two biggest advantages of the ZV-E10 over the ZV-1 are the larger 24-megapixel APS-C sensor and interchangeable mirrorless mount. The latter feature opens Sony&#8217;s range of 60-plus E-mount lenses to vloggers, making the ZV-E10 much more versatile than the fixed-lens ZV-1. The larger sensor, meanwhile, will deliver improved light sensitivity and a shallower depth of field.</p>

<p>The ZV-E10 uses the aging 24-megapixel APS-C sensor found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-sony-a6100-review.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">A6100</a> and other recent Sony models. While that delivers sharp, downsampled 4K video at up to 30 fps (or 120 fps 1080p), it&#8217;s likely to have a serious amount of rolling shutter that&#8217;s not ideal for its intended purpose.</p>
<p>On the more positive side, it offers optical and active electronic image stabilization, just like the ZV-1. That should smooth out handheld shooting pretty well, though don&#8217;t expect miracles for walk-and-talk type vlogging — especially if rolling sensor wobble proves to be an issue.</p>
<p>Size-wise, the ZV-E10 is smaller than any of the A6000-series cameras at 343 grams and isn&#8217;t much larger and heavier than the ZV-1. It lacks an electronic viewfinder, but it&#8217;s Sony&#8217;s first APS-C mirrorless camera with a fully-articulating flip-out screen — a basic requirement on any vlogging camera these days.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-07%2F64212810-eee8-11eb-baff-b61f12e08d82&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=793af9203a3031778b3f00278753057af3a9b368" alt="Sony’s ZV-E10 brings interchangeable lenses to its vlogging camera series" data-uuid="e242a174-5557-3063-9622-1bdd40262cda" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div>
</figure>
<p>The ZV-E10 comes with Sony&#8217;s latest phase-detect autofocus system, both for video and still shooting. That means you should get incredibly quick subject tracking, along with reliable eye, face and head detect autofocus. It also has an S&amp;Q (slow &amp; quick) feature that lets you record time-lapse and slow motion footage in-camera without the need for any post processing work.</p>
<p>It borrows several vlogging features directly from the ZV-1. The first is called &#8220;product showcase,&#8221; a setting that allows it to instantly focus away from your face and onto an object placed in front of the camera. That&#8217;s particularly handy for vloggers reviewing products, devices, etc.</p>
<p>The other is a bokeh switch that instantly sets the lowest f-stop available for lighting conditions. That way, you can have the background as defocused as possible, allowing your subject to stand out clearly.</p>
<p>The ZV-E10 has a built-in, high-quality three-way microphone (left, right and central channels) that&#8217;s designed to pick out your voice. That means you can vlog without the need to buy a microphone, though it still won&#8217;t match the quality and voice isolation of a dedicated shotgun or lapel mic. It also comes with a hotshoe-attached muff to help block wind noise, and if that&#8217;s not enough, a wind noise reduction setting. It also comes with a microphone input, though not a headphone output.</p>
<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re into live streaming, you can connect the ZV-E10 directly to a smartphone and stream directly to YouTube or other services — much as you can with Panasonic&#8217;s latest GH5-II. It will also work directly as a webcam, streaming both video and audio (not just video like other cameras) so you can take advantage of its high-quality microphone.</p>
<p>The ZV-E10 will be available in either black or white by the end of August and will cost $700 for the body, or $800 in a bundle including Sony&#8217;s 16-50mm F/3.5-5.6 power zoom lens.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The LIVE experience will include a number of new features for creators to make it more competitive with platforms like Instagram Live.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-live-features-2021">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s expanding its TikTok LIVE platform, which currently allows creators to livestream to fans while responding to viewer comments and questions and accept <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/live-gifting/">virtual gifts</a>. Now, the LIVE experience will include a number of new features for creators to make it more competitive with platforms like Instagram Live, including the ability to go live with others, host Q&amp;As, use moderators and improved keyword filters, and more.</p>
<p>For viewers, TikTok is also adding new discovery and viewing tools, among other changes.</p>
<p>The company recently <a href="https://twitter.com/tiktokcreators/status/1417527500121415680">teased</a> some of the LIVE updates to creators across social media ahead of today&#8217;s announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; TikTok Creators (@tiktokcreators) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiktokcreators/status/1417527500121415680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>According to TikTok, select markets have already had access to LIVE Events, which is a new tool that lets creators better plan their upcoming LIVE sessions.</p>
<p>Creators can schedule and promote their event in advance to build anticipation across their community, while fans can discover, register, and then get notifications and reminders when the LIVE Event is about to begin. Scheduling tools are a fairly common baseline feature for livestreaming platforms to offer, so it makes sense that TikTok would add this.  </p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182486" style="width: 662px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182486" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2182486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-events.png?w=652" alt="" width="652" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-events.png 884w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-events.png?resize=144,150 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-events.png?resize=288,300 288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-events.png?resize=768,801 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-events.png?resize=652,680 652w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-events.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-events.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182486" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>To use this feature, creators can select the LIVE Events icon from the top-right corner of their profile page, then name the event, list the start time and write a brief description. Once they hit create, the LIVE event will go through a brief review process before being visible to the rest of TikTok.</p>
<p>After the event is scheduled, creators can share it through in-app messages, promote with a TikTok video using a LIVE countdown sticker or promote it outside of TikTok. They can also make changes or even delete the event. As they plan for their event, TikTok will show how many people have already registered to attend to better inform creators&#8217; promotional efforts.</p>
<p>This feature had already become available in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but is now testing in other global markets, the company said.</p>
<p>Creators can also now go live with others in order to benefit from the combined audience. Currently, the ability to go live with one other co-host is available worldwide, but TikTok is testing going live with multiple hosts in select regions. For comparison, Instagram this year launched the ability for creators to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/instagram-launches-live-rooms-for-live-broadcasts-with-up-to-four-creators/">go live with up to four others</a> in Live Rooms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok&#8217;s LIVE Q&amp;As allow audience members to ask questions during the creator&#8217;s livestreams. Creators can view these questions in their stream chat from a separate panel and have the option to show the questions to all viewers and answer them formally through the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/tiktok-launches-tiktok-qa-a-new-feature-for-creators-to-engage-with-users-questions/">existing</a> Q&amp;A tools.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182488" style="width: 642px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182488" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2182488" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-qa.png?w=632" alt="" width="632" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-qa.png 818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-qa.png?resize=139,150 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-qa.png?resize=279,300 279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-qa.png?resize=768,826 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-qa.png?resize=632,680 632w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-qa.png?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182488" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Another new tool allows creators to assign trusted moderators to manage their streams before a livestream starts. These moderators will have the ability to mute and block users from the chat as needed. The keyword filtering tool, which blocks words the creators don&#8217;t want to appear in their chats, has also been expanded to support up to 200 terms.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, TikTok will also introduce a way for hosts and moderators to temporarily mute viewers and remove comments.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182490" style="width: 657px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182490" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182490 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-mods.png?w=647" alt="" width="647" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-mods.png 874w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-mods.png?resize=143,150 143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-mods.png?resize=286,300 286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-mods.png?resize=768,807 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-mods.png?resize=647,680 647w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tiktok-live-mods.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182490" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>For viewers, meanwhile, TikTok will make it easier to find LIVE videos to watch. Soon, users will be able to tune into LIVE videos directly from the For You Feed and Following pages, by tapping on the new LIVE button, which some may already have, then the &#8220;Explore&#8221; button, which launches a side panel where they can browse the various LIVE videos available now.</p>
<p>TikTok says the top LIVE categories to date included chat/Q&amp;A, gaming, talents, fashion and daily life.</p>
<p>Viewers will also be prompted to reconsider their comments during the livestream if the system detects they&#8217;re about to post something potentially harmful or abusive. TikTok has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/tiktok-to-flag-and-downrank-unsubstantiated-claims-fact-checkers-cant-verify/">used prompts before to flag</a> unsubstantiated claims in videos its fact-checkers couldn&#8217;t verify and it has used a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/tiktok-rolls-out-new-commenting-features-aimed-at-preventing-bullying/"> similar prompt to address potentially bullying comments. </a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182492" style="width: 658px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182492" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2182492" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tikok-live-prompts.png?w=648" alt="" width="648" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tikok-live-prompts.png 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tikok-live-prompts.png?resize=143,150 143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tikok-live-prompts.png?resize=286,300 286w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tikok-live-prompts.png?resize=768,805 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tikok-live-prompts.png?resize=648,680 648w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/tikok-live-prompts.png?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182492" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Livestream viewers can also now use picture-in-picture mode on iOS and Android to watch LIVE videos while continuing to use their phone.</p>
<p>The TikTok LIVE experience became particularly popular during the pandemic. And while the company declined to share exact viewer metrics for its livestreams, it said that the number of people going live and the number of people watching LIVE videos had doubled over the last year. These videos may be helping to fuel demand for the app as well, as a recent report from Sensor Tower noted <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">TikTok became the first non-Facebook app to reach 3 billion downloads</a> worldwide, despite being banned in India. </p>
<p>The report also noted that in Q2 2021 the app saw its greatest quarter-over-quarter growth in consumer spending in a year&#8217;s time, climbing 39% to $534.6 million, up from $384.7 million in the previous quarter. This could signal increased interest in livestreams, as that&#8217;s where creators tend to generate revenue through virtual gifts.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s LIVE platform is only open to users over the age of 16, and it regularly removes those who the system detects may be underage. (Asked about a recent purge, TikTok said it&#8217;s just enforcing its existing guidelines.) It also bans accounts that impersonate or mislead the community about their identity, it said.</p>
<p>All of the new features are available, in some form, to global audiences presently.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Edtech investors are increasingly going global, but regulatory crackdowns in China, which instructed K-12 tutoring startups to go nonprofit, have led to a chill among check-writers in the country.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Edtech investors based in the U.S. are increasingly going global, but <a href="http://www.moe.gov.cn/jyb_xxgk/moe_1777/moe_1778/202107/t20210724_546576.html">recent regulatory crackdowns in China</a>, which instructed local K-12 tutoring startups to go nonprofit, have led to a chill among check-writers looking at the country.</p>
<p>When I first started reporting on edtech over a year ago, U.S.-based investors often cited China as validation of the opportunity for direct-to-consumer businesses in the K-12 world. The success of Chinese edtech was used to predict the surge of U.S.-based consumer edtech, which saw parent adoption surge during the pandemic.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			On Saturday, the Chinese government rolled out legislation aimed at easing the financial burden of education services on families, at the cost of venture-backed startups.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>On Saturday, however, the Chinese government rolled out legislation aimed at easing the financial burden of education services on families, at the cost of venture-backed startups. The reactions were mixed: One founder told me they doubled their personal stake in every publicly traded Chinese edtech startup, considering the present issues a blip in the timeline, but another told me that they were glad they sold their investments in China just last month.</p>
<p>And everyone seems to be looking to India as the next geographic testing ground.</p>
<h2>&#8220;We didn’t think we were smart enough&#8221;</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-confirms-for-profit-tutoring-core-school-subjects-is-barred-xinhua-2021-07-24/">Reuters reported last week</a> that China is barring for-profit tutoring platforms on core school subjects. The country has also introduced time caps and tutoring curfews, and notably, forbade the platforms from raising capital through IPOs as well as advertising their programs. The news <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">sent Chinese edtech stocks tumbling</a> — NYSE-listed TAL Education&#8217;s shares, for instance, closed at $4.47 per share on Monday, down nearly 80% from $20.52 per share last Thursday before the news broke.</p>
<p>Owl Ventures, which has one of the largest edtech-focused funds at $585 million, has been actively investing globally over the past few years. Investor Ian Chiu said last October that he views K-12 tutoring in China as “the biggest market right now in education.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Among Silicon Valley circles, a fun parlor game is to ask to what extent world GDP levels are held back by a lack of computer science and technical training. How many startups could be built if hundreds of thousands or even millions more people could code and bring their entrepreneurial ideas to fruition? How many bureaucratic processes could be eliminated if developers were more latent in every business?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is on the order of “a lot,” but the barriers to reaching this world remain formidable. Computer science is a challenging field, and despite proactive attempts by legislatures to add more coding skills into school curriculums, the reality is that the demand for software engineering vastly outstrips the supply available in the market.</p>
<p>Coding is not a bubble, and <a href="https://bubble.io">Bubble</a> wants to empower the democratization of software development and the creation of new startups. Through its platform, Bubble enables anyone — coder or not — to begin building modern web applications using a click-and-drag interface that can connect data sources and other software together in one fluid interface.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a bold bet — and it’s just received a bold bet as well. Bubble announced today that Ryan Hinkle of Insight Partners has led a $100 million Series A round into the company. Hinkle, a longtime managing director at the firm, specializes in growth buyout deals as well as growth SaaS companies.</p>
<p>If that round size seems huge, it’s because Bubble has had a long history as a bootstrapped company before reaching its current scale. Co-founders Emmanuel Straschnov and Josh Haas spent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/bubble-lets-you-create-web-applications-with-no-coding-experience/">seven years bootstrapping and tinkering with the product</a> before securing a <a href="https://bubble.io/blog/bubble-raises-seed-round/">$6.5 million seed round in June 2019</a> led by SignalFire. Interestingly, according to Straschnov, Insight was the first venture firm to reach out to Bubble all the way back in 2014. Seven years on, the two have now signed and closed a deal.</p>

<p>Since the seed round, Bubble has been expanding its functionality. As a no-code tool, any missing feature could potentially block an application from being built. “In our business, it’s a features game,” Straschnov said. “[Our users] are not technical, but they have high standards.” He noted that the company introduced a plugins system that allows the Bubble community to build their own additions to the platform.</p>

Its editor offers a clickable interface for designing dynamic web applications. </p></div></p>
<p>As the platform matured, it happened to nail the timing of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, which saw people scrambling for new skills and improving their prospects amid a gloomy job market. Straschnov says that Bubble saw an immediate bump in usage in March and April 2020, and the company has tripled revenue over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Bubble’s focus for the past eight years has been on helping people turn their ideas into startups. The company’s proposition is that a large number of even venture-backed companies could be built using Bubble without the expense of a large engineering team writing code from scratch.</p>
<p>Unlike other no-code tools, which focus on building internal corporate apps, Straschnov says that the company remains as focused today on these new companies as it has always been. “[We’re] not trying to move upmarket just yet — we are trying to do the same thing that AWS and Stripe did five years ago,” he said. Instead of trying to dominate the enterprise, Bubble wants to grow with its nascent customers as they expand in scale.</p>
<p>The company today charges a range of prices depending on the performance and scale requirements of an application. There’s a free tier, and then professional pricing starts at $25/month all the way to $475/month for its top-listed offering. Enterprise pricing is also available, as is special pricing for students.</p>
<p>On the latter point, Bubble is looking to invest heavily in education using its newly raised capital. While the platform is easy to use, the reality is that any design of a web application can be intimidating for a new user, particularly one who isn’t technical. So the company wants to create more videos and documentation while also heavily investing in partnerships with universities to get more students using the platform.</p>
<p>While the no-code space has seen prodigious investment, Straschnov said that “I don’t look at all the no-code players as competition … the true competition we have is code.” He noted that while the no-code label has been assumed by more and more startups, very few companies are focused on his company’s specific niche, and he believes he offers a compelling value proposition in that category.</p>
<p>The company has doubled headcount since the beginning of the pandemic, growing from around 21 employees to about 45 today. They are lightly concentrated in New York City, but the company operates remotely and has folks in 15 states as well as in France. Straschnov says that the company is looking to aggressively hire technical talent to build out the product using its new funds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s the latest in a succession of secretive tests Joby's been conducting, all part of its goal to achieve certification with the Federal Aviation Administration and start commercial operations.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Santa Cruz, California-based Joby Aviation has completed the longest test flight of an eVTOL to date: Its unnamed full-sized prototype aircraft concluded a trip of over 150 miles on a single charge, the company said Monday.</p>
<p>The test was completed at Joby’s Electric Flight Base in Big Sur, California, earlier this month. It’s the latest in a succession of secretive tests the company’s been conducting, all part of its goal to achieve certification with the Federal Aviation Administration and start commercial operations.</p>
<p>The prototype spent more than an hour and 17 minutes in the air and covered 154.6 statute miles on a single battery charge, traveling along a predefined circuit. While the test flight was remotely piloted by Joby’s chief test pilot, Justin Paines, the company plans to have pilots in the aircraft when it opens its ridesharing service for customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Headed by JoeBen Bevirt, Joby Aviation has spent the past 12 years designing eVTOL – an electric vertical take-off and landing craft that ascends like a helicopter but flies like an airplane and is magnitudes quieter than both.</p>
<p>Joby is one of a suite of startups looking to make electric air travel a reality for the average American. The company’s website features a graphic showing a proposed trip from Los Angeles airport to Newport Beach – over an hour and 44 miles by car, but only 15 minutes and 35 miles with Joby. Joby aims to make such trips a reality by 2024, and tests like these are a major sign to the public, investors and regulators that it is on track to meet that timeline.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Future of Flight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/video/the-future-of-flight/embed/#?secret=M5YQg700bW" data-secret="M5YQg700bW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Significantly, the company uses commercially available lithium-ion batteries that it has adapted for air travel, so this test flight is also proof that its battery tech is up for the challenge. It’s tricky: The battery must have enough energy density to fly around 150 miles while also having enough power to take off and land vertically. But Joby says it&#8217;s nailed a specific combination of cathode and graphite anode to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>Besides being one of the oldest eVTOL developers, Joby is also the best-funded, having raised nearly $800 million in funding to date. That includes a $75 million investment from Uber after Joby bought its air taxi arm, Elevate, and a $400 million investment from Toyota Motor Corp. Joby is going to go public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/joby-aviation-takes-flight-into-the-public-markets-via-a-spac-merger/">via a merger</a> with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners, a business combination that will inject the startup with an additional $1.6 billion in capital.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of money, but designing and commercializing a novel aircraft is an expensive business. According to some estimates, it could cost up to $1 billion all told.</p>
<p>“We’ve achieved something that many thought impossible with today’s battery technology,” Bevirt said in a statement. “By doing so we’ve taken the first step towards making convenient, emissions-free air travel between places like San Francisco and Lake Tahoe, Houston and Austin, or Los Angeles and San Diego an everyday reality.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been just over five months since Carl Pei first told the world about Nothing. Perhaps it’s just the way time moves these days or maybe it’s the fact that the company has trickled out information in the intervening months. Whatever the case, it feels like we’ve been waiting on today’s full Ear (1) reveal forever.</p>
<p>It’s been a pretty savvy strategy for a brand-new consumer hardware startup, building on the built-in buzz/anticipation from Pei’s connection to OnePlus. We’ve covered a number (but certainly not all) of the announcements between February and now and gotten most of the jokes about its name out of our system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181963" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181963" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2181963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Nothing-ear-1-ladybirds-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Nothing-ear-1-ladybirds-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Nothing-ear-1-ladybirds-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Nothing-ear-1-ladybirds-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Nothing-ear-1-ladybirds-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Nothing-ear-1-ladybirds-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Nothing-ear-1-ladybirds-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Nothing-ear-1-ladybirds-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181963" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Nothing (Note the&#8230;friendly insect marketing theme). </p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Frankly, the sheer volume of news Nothing has released hasn’t left a lot to the imagination. Our interview with Pei revealed the pricing of the buds ($99 USD), along with their noise canceling. We recently caught an image of the transparent charging case and battery life (24 hours, all told, with the case and ANC turned on, 36 hours without) via a StockX auction. In fact, the only thing left to reveal was the buds themselves (a pretty big piece, admittedly).</p>
<p>In conversations I’ve had with Pei, the founder has emphasized aesthetics as a key differentiator. The message has, admittedly, been somewhat muddled by the imagery Nothing has chosen to release. The first image associated with the company and product was actually the silhouette of the device’s PCB (printed circuit board). The second was an early concept Pei said was inspired by his grandmother’s tobacco pipe.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Nothing was keen to highlight how much it iterated on this project before launch. In fact, Pei told me that such iterations were part of the reason the product’s original launch was pushed back by a few months. For one thing, the company wanted the Ear (1) to look distinct from anything else on the market. For another, there’s an added level of complications when making your gadget at least partially transparent. That means the insides — the components and the glue that gold them together — need to look as good as the outside.</p>
<p>One thing you can say almost immediately about the Ear (1): Nothing looks quite like them. From a form factor standpoint, they most closely resemble AirPods, with a long stem that drops down from the buds. The stems themselves feature the majority of the product’s transparency (putting aside the case for a moment). The bud segment is an opaque white, likely owing to the fact that the those insides are frankly more unsightly.</p>
<p>Each stem features a touch panel single color dot — red and white — to distinguish right from left. That’s a subtle nod to RCA cables, with red for right and white for left. Another nice aesthetic touch is the Nothing logo printed down the lengths of the stem. The dotted text is an homage to printing on circuit boards — it’s an aesthetic the company is using across its press material. Around the other side are two magnetic dots that connect to the charging pins in the case.</p>

<p>The case is made of transparent plastic, with a pair of dots that keep the buds in place. A third, large concave circle further secures the case and doubles as a spot for your thumb while holding it. A white swath runs through the center of the case, again presumably covering up some unsightly electronics.</p>
<p>The buds themselves feature 11.6mm drivers and audio tuned by Teenage Engineering, which also served as the design team. There’s Bluetooth 5.2 onboard and a trio of listening modes: Active Nose Canceling, Light Mode and Active Transparency. Some other features worth, including a built-in chirp for locating lost buds via the app.</p>
<p>They go on sale July 31 for $99. Stay tuned for a review.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The latest financing brings Fireblocks’ total raised since its 2018 inception to $489 million. The valuation boost correlates with its increase in customers and ARR this year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.fireblocks.com">Fireblocks</a>, an infrastructure provider for digital assets, has raised $310 million in a Series D round of funding that tripled the company’s valuation to $2.2 billion in just over five months.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/">Sequoia Capital</a>,<a href="https://www.stripes.co/"> Stripes</a> and<a href="https://sparkcapital.com/"> Spark Capital</a> co-led Fireblocks’ latest round, which also included participation from<a href="https://www.coatue.com/"> Coatue</a>,<a href="https://drwvc.com/"> DRW VC</a> and<a href="https://www.scb10x.com/"> SCB 10X</a> – the venture arm of Thailand’s oldest bank – and Siam Commercial Bank. The latter is the third global bank to invest in Fireblocks in addition to the Bank of New York (BNY) Mellon and SVB Capital.</p>
<p>In February, the New York-based startup<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/crypto-infrastructure-provider-fireblocks-raises-133-million/"> raised $133 million in a Series C round</a> at a $700 million valuation. The latest financing brings Fireblocks’ total raised since its 2018 inception to $489 million. And as for Fireblocks’ valuation boost, the growth correlates with its increase in customers and ARR this year, according to CEO and co-founder Michael Shaulov.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since January, Fireblocks has seen its customer base increase to about 500 compared to 150 in January. Its ARR (annual recurring revenue) is also up &#8212; by 350% so far in 2021 compared to 2020. Last year, ARR rose by 450% compared to 2019.</p>
<p>“We expect to end the year up 500%,” Shaulov said. “We’ve already adjusted our revenue predictions for 2021 three times.”</p>
<p>Put simply, Fireblocks aims to offer financial institutions an all-in-one platform to run a digital asset business, providing them with infrastructure to store, transfer and issue digital assets. In particular, Fireblocks provides custody to institutional investors and has secured the transfer of over $1 trillion in digital assets over time.</p>
<p>Fireblocks launched out of stealth mode in June 2019 and has since opened offices in the United Kingdom, Israel, Hong Kong, Singapore, France and the<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4623/dach-countries/"> DACH region</a>. Today, it has over 500 financial institutions as customers &#8212; a mix of businesses that already support crypto and digital assets and those that are considering entering the space. Customers include global banks, crypto-native exchanges, lending desks, hedge funds and OTC desks, as well as companies such as Revolut, BlockFi, Celsius, PrimeTrust, Galaxy Digital, Genesis Trading,<a href="http://crypto.com/"> crypto.com</a> and eToro, among others.</p>
<p>Of those 500 institutions, Fireblocks is working with 70 banks that are looking to join the cryptocurrency space and start platforming their infrastructure, according to Shaulov. Siam Commercial bank, for example, is using the company’s infrastructure to transform into a blockchain-based bank.</p>
<p>“Our platform creates highly secure wallets for cryptocurrencies and digital assets where institutions can store their funds or their customer funds and also get security insurance,” he said.</p>

<p>Fireblocks’ issuance and tokenization platform allows for the creation of asset-backed tokens.</p>
<p>“We handle all the security or compliance, all the policies and workflows,” Shaulov said. “Basically all the complicated stuff you need to do as a business when you want to start working with this new technology. So it’s a bit like ‘Shopify for crypto.’”</p>
<p>Sequoia Partner Ravi Gupta is naturally bullish on the company, describing Fireblocks as “the leading back-end infrastructure for crypto products.”</p>
<p>“The team has the potential to build a large, enduring business serving crypto-native companies, consumer fintech companies and traditional financial institutions alike,” he told TechCrunch. “Their growth has been tremendous, and the quality of their product and customer sentiment are remarkable.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182284" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182284" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182284 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19_1-e1627345255350.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182284" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Left to right: Fireblocks co-founders Idan Ofrat, Michael Shaulov and Pavel Berengoltz / Fireblocks</p></div></p>
<p>Fireblocks has also started to see businesses outside of what would be identified as fintech or finance show interest in its platform, such as e-commerce websites that are looking to create NFTs on the back of their merchandise.</p>
<p>The Fireblocks platform, Shaulov said, helps spread the expansion of digital asset use cases beyond bitcoin into payments, gaming, NFTs and digital securities and “ultimately allows any business to become a digital asset business.”</p>
<p>What that means is that Fireblocks’ technology can be white-labeled for crypto custody offerings, “so that new and established financial institutions can implement direct custody on their own without having to rely on third parties,” the company said.</p>
<p>Shaulov emphasized Fireblocks’ commitment to staying an independent company after a wave of consolidation in the space. Earlier this year, PayPal announced its plans<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/paypal-to-acquire-cryptocurrency-custody-startup-curv/"> to acquire Curv</a>, a cryptocurrency startup based in Tel Aviv, Israel. In early May, bitcoin-focused Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. said it agreed to buy BitGo Inc. for $1.2 billion in cash and stock in<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/galaxy-digital-to-buy-bitgo-in-crypto-sectors-first-1-billion-deal-11620212281"> the first $1 billion deal</a> in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p>“Consolidation can be painful for clients,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. “It’s important for us that we stay independent and that’s part of the purpose of this round.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company will also use the funds to increase its engineering and customer success operations and expand geographically, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fireblocks provides the most secure and flexible platform for a wide range of customer needs,” said Sequoia’s Gupta. “It uses world-class multi-party computation technology to secure digital assets in storage and in transit, and has the most flexible platform with controls for product teams to be able to build on and manage Fireblocks effectively.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The previously bootstrapped 1Password raised its first round of external capital in 2019, a $200 million Series A led by Accel that represented the VC firm’s largest single investment in its 35 years.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto-based <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> is one of those rare companies that is a) profitable and b) transparent enough to share financials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the company announced that it raised $100 million in a Series B round of funding that doubles the company’s valuation to $2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may recall that the previously bootstrapped 1Password only raised its first round of external capital in 2019 – </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/fourteen-years-after-launching-1password-takes-first-funding-a-200m-series-a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $200 million Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Accel that represented the venture firm’s largest single investment in its 35-year history</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the time, 1Password was hardly a startup, having been founded in 2005. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel also led its latest round, which notably included participation from Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, Kim Jackson&#8217;s Skip Capital and a slew of tech executives including Tobias Lütke, CEO of Shopify; Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify; Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and CEO of Slack; Anthony Caselena, founder and CEO of Squarespace; Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, co-CEOs of Atlassian; and Kevin Hartz, co-founder and chairman of Eventbrite, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profitable since day one, 1Password recently crossed the $120 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue) mark, according to CEO Jeff Shiner. Over 90,000 businesses use its SaaS platform, including a number of big names such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Armour, Shopify, the PGA, IBM, GitLab, Slack and PagerDuty. That’s up from 50,000 customers at the time of its November 2019 raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founding couples </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Sara Teare and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roustem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Natalia Karimov came up with the idea for 1Password while they were growing another company that built websites and realized the struggle of keeping up with passwords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started out focused on consumers only. Over time, it evolved and began offering its password management services to businesses. This move took an already successful company to another level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also caught the attention of Accel, which has a history of investing in bootstrapped and profitable businesses. In both its Series A and B rounds, the venture firm approached the company about investing.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="U2kyw0AIwD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/lower-raises-100m-series-a-from-accel/">In its first funding in 7 years, profitable fintech Lower raises $100M Series A led by Accel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In its first funding in 7 years, profitable fintech Lower raises $100M Series A led by Accel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/lower-raises-100m-series-a-from-accel/embed/#?secret=U2kyw0AIwD" data-secret="U2kyw0AIwD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel partner Arun Mathew, who drove his firm’s investment in 1Password in both rounds, noted that “1Password has a very unique company profile. To see a company riding all these market tailwinds with fundamentals and metrics like this is really, really unusual. Our hope is this [latest round] allows the entire company to be even more aggressive about winning this market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its last raise, 1Password has continued to evolve &#8212; a testament to its self-proclaimed intent to never sit on its laurels, said Shiner. For one thing, it has increased its headcount from 174 employees to about 475 today, including the formation of a go-to-market team, which the company never really had before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the past few months, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password has expanded its business offerings, launching</span><a href="https://blog.1password.com/introducing-secrets-automation/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Secrets Automation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in April and more recently,</span><a href="https://blog.1password.com/introducing-events-api/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password Events, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an enterprise offering aimed at protecting “critical”  business information. It has also launched a </span><a href="https://blog.1password.com/welcoming-linux-to-the-1password-family/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linux Desktop Application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and integrations with Slack and Rippling. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2182195" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2182195" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2182195 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="459" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg 2432w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=768,518 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=680,459 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=1536,1036 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=2048,1381 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/01-Lock-screen.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2182195" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> 1Password</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secrets Automation, Shiner said, allows 1Password to protect a business’ infrastructure secrets “machine to machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Password management is usually human to machine, so it’s a huge win for us and expands what we do into the broader infrastructure,” he added. It was able to launch Secrets Automation with the help of the acquisition of a Dutch company, SecretHub. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is planning to use some of its new capital for further acquisitions as the number of startups in the cybersecurity space continues to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having a stronger balance sheet </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only helps the company take calculated risks and be opportunistic about potential M&amp;A or investing even more aggressively where we see opportunity,” Accel’s Mathew said. “For almost 16 years, this company has been one of the best-kept secrets, no pun intended, for businesses and consumers alike.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting work-from-home shift only led to more demand for 1Password’s offering. In fact, with each business account, 1Password is giving each employee a free family account to use at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As work and home have mixed, it’s been a huge benefit for users,” Shiner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That line-blurring is one of the reasons that Accel sees even more potential in 1Password. The firm has 24 active security investments across its portfolio, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel partner Ethan Choi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This doubling down [on 1Password] signifies our belief that this is one of the most important areas of security today,&#8221; Choi said. &#8220;CIOs and CISOs want their employees to be productive and get into the applications they need to, but they also need them to be secure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, 1Password believes that despite being around for 16 years, it’s only “just scratching the surface,” according to Shiner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that’s what gets us excited, is just this incredible opportunity that we see in front of us,” he said. “We need to keep moving forward, with urgency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaining the insight of so many experienced tech execs was also a factor in raising more capital, Shiner said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Site reliability engineering platform <a href="http://www.blameless.com/">Blameless</a> announced Tuesday it raised $30 million in a Series B funding round, led by Third Point Ventures with participation from Accel, Decibel and Lightspeed Venture Partners, to bring total funding to over $50 million.</p>
<p>Site reliability engineering (SRE) is an extension of DevOps designed for more complex environments.</p>
<p>Blameless, based in San Mateo, California, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/blameless-emerges-from-stealth-with-20m-investment-to-help-companies-transition-to-sre/">emerged from stealth in 2019</a> after raising both a seed and Series A round, totaling $20 million. Since then, it has turned its business into a blossoming software platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blameless’ platform provides the context, guardrails and automated workflows so engineering teams are unified in the way they communicate and interact, especially to resolve issues quicker as they build their software systems.</p>
<p>It originally worked with tech-forward teams at large companies, like Home Depot, that were “dipping [their toes] into the space and now [want] to double down,” co-founder and CEO Lyon Wong told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company still works with those tech-forward teams, but in the past two years, more companies sought out resident SRE architect Kurt Anderson to advise them, causing Blameless to change up its business approach, Wong said.</p>
<p>Other companies are also seeing a trend of customers asking for support — for example, in March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/google-cloud-launches-a-new-support-option-for-mission-critical-workloads/">Google Cloud unveiled its Mission Critical Services support option</a> for SRE to serve in a similar role as a consultant as companies move toward readiness with their systems. And in February, Nobl9 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/nobl9-raises-21m-series-b-for-its-slo-management-platform/">raised a $21 million Series B</a> to provide enterprises with the tools they need to build service-level-objective-centric operations, which is part of a company’s SRE efforts.</p>
<p>Blameless now has interest from more mainstream companies in the areas of enterprise, logistics and healthcare. These companies aren’t necessarily focused on technology, but see a need for SRE.</p>
<p>“Companies recognize the shortfall in reliability, and then the question they come to us with is how do they get from where they are to where they want to be,” Anderson said. “Often companies that don&#8217;t have a process respond with ‘all hands on deck’ all the time, but instead need to shift to the right people responding.”</p>
<p>Lyon plans to use the new funding to fill key leadership roles, the company’s go-to-market strategy and product development to enable the company to go after larger enterprises.</p>
<p>Blameless doubled its revenue in the last year and will expand to service all customer segments, adding small and emerging businesses to its roster of midmarket and large companies. The company also expects to double headcount in the next three quarters.</p>
<p>As part of the funding announcement, Third Point Ventures partner Dan Moskowitz will join Blameless’ board of directors with Wong, Accel partner Vas Natarajan and Lightspeed partner Ravi Mhatre.</p>
<p>“Freeing up engineering to focus on shipping code is exactly what Blameless achieves,” said Moskowitz in a written statement. “The Blameless market opportunity is big as we see teams struggle and resort to creating homegrown playbooks and point solutions that are incomplete and costly.”</p>
