The 2021 edition of the awards was also a watershed year for Apple TV+, which took home 10 Emmys including seven for its comedy series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ted-lasso-season-two-july-23-apple-tv-plus-225341867.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Ted Lasso</em></a>.</p>
<p>To be sure, a huge chunk of Netflix&#8217;s Emmy harvest came from the 34 Creative Arts Emmys it won last week. However, it still took a further 10 primetime Emmys including acting awards for Olivia Colman, Gillian Anderson and Josh O&#8217;Connor in <em>The Crown</em>, along with Ewan McGregor in <em>Halston</em>. <em>The Crown</em> also won for writing and directing, while taking the prestigious best drama series prize. Netflix&#8217;s The Queen&#8217;s Gambit, starring Anya Taylor-Joy, won for best limited series.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apple TV+ had its best Emmys yet with 10 total, including seven in primetime. It dominated the comedy series category with seven wins for <em>Ted Lasso</em>, including three in the acting category for Brett Goldstein and Hannah Waddingham (best supporting actors) along with Jason Sudeikis (best actor). <em>Ted Lasso</em> also took the award for best comedy series.</p>
<p>Thanks in large part to that series, Apple TV+ fared much better than its rivals. Disney+ did beat it with 14 awards total, up from eight in 2020, but only one of those was a primetime Emmy (<em>Hamilton</em> for best pre-recorded variety special). Amazon and Hulu were completely shut out in 2021, after both won Emmys in 2020.</p>
<p>HBO and HBO Max led all rivals with 130 nominations and took 19 Emmys, including 9 in primetime. The biggest winners last night were Jean Smart for <em>Hacks</em> (best actress in a comedy series) and Kate Winslet for <em>Mare of Easstown</em>(best actress in a limited series). After she was controversially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-the-crown-win-big-at-the-golden-globe-awards-091701851.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">shut out</a> of the Golden Globes nominations, Michaela Coel took the prize for best writing in a limited series for <em>I May Destroy You</em>.</p>
<p>It was notable in 2018 when Netflix managed to tie a cable network, HBO (pre-HBO Max), for the most Emmy wins. This year, it beat all rivals by a long way, and streaming platforms overall took the top four spots. Whether that can continue when the pandemic starts to wane — and subscription growth declines — remains to be seen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eli Electric Vehicles, an early stage compact EV manufacturer, announced the start of production on its flagship Eli Zero, a micro &#8220;neighborhood electric vehicle&#8221; that is built for city commuting. The company plans to roll out small batches of the two-seater EV to distributors across 13 European countries over the next few months with a starting price of $11,999.</p>
<p>Micro-electric vehicles are on the rise with other compact quadricycles coming to market recently, including the <a href="https://www.renault.co.uk/electric-vehicles/twizy.html">Renault Twizy</a>, the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Citro%C3%ABn+Ami.&amp;oq=Citro%C3%ABn+Ami.&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l9.1372j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Citroën Ami</a>, the <a href="https://newatlas.com/urban-transport/triggo-tilting-electric-quadricycle/">tilting Triggo EV</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/squad-mobility-eyes-shared-platforms-as-target-for-its-compact-solar-electric-quadricycle/">Squad Mobility solar-assisted car</a>. In terms of pricing, the Eli is at the higher end of the spectrum along with the Twizy at a starting price of around $16,000. For comparison, the Ami costs around $6,000 and the Squad car costs $6,790.</p>
<p>While Eli is based in Los Angeles, its manufacturing partner is in China, and ongoing geopolitical tensions are part of  the reason the company is pursuing a European strategy initially. The varied laws per state on what maketh a street legal vehicle also make it difficult to go to market in the U.S. first, according to Marcus Li, CEO and founder of Eli. In Europe, the Zeros are street legal and there is already a culture around smaller, compact cars that don&#8217;t go too fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a lot of European cities, for example in Paris, they now have very strict legal speed limit of 30 kilometers per hour (19 mph), and I think we see that being a trend in European cities like Vienna and Amsterdam,&#8221; Li told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Zero, which is built of recyclable polypropylene and high-strength aluminium, has a top speed of 25 miles per hour. It&#8217;s about 7 feet long, 4.5 feet wide and 5 feet high with a storage capacity of 160 liters. The batteries have a 5.8 kWh capacity, a range of 50 miles and can charge from 0 to 100 percent in 2.5 hours at 220 volts.</p>
<p>The micro-vehicle also has power-assisted braking and steering, a rear camera, a parking sensor and other internal features like a USB charging port, cup holders, heat and cooling, a tiltable sunroof and a 7 inch dashboard display. The basic colors are pearl white and silver, and the premium colors available are graphite and baby blue.</p>
<p>Eli also recently announced its equity crowdfunding campaign<a href="https://www.startengine.com/eli"> via StartEngine platform</a>. At the time of publishing this article, the company had raised $224,705 that it will use to fund further production. Li said the company has more reservations than it does vehicles at the moment, which he reckons is a good problem to have.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eli had previously raised around $1.4 million on StartEngine&#8217;s platform and to date, has raised over $6.5 million. Li said the company had attempted to seek VC funding last year, but VCs only wanted to invest if Eli would use its vehicle for car sharing.</p>
<p>&#8220;At some point, to be honest, we did think about pivoting to car sharing because that&#8217;s just the feedback from most institutional investors,&#8221; said Li. &#8220;Their business model is a little different from conventional hardware companies in terms of return on investment, and they would have preferred that we go more into a car sharing and high valuation model to see a return three years down the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Li said one investment group was ready to invest if Eli agreed to do the operations of a car sharing platform themselves, but this was just before the pandemic and ultimately, he&#8217;s glad the company didn&#8217;t pivot in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking a very traditional approach to sales,&#8221; said Li. &#8220;We&#8217;re not doing B2C. We&#8217;re selling through an established distributor called KSR Group and they have their launch strategy first to Austria, Germany and Switzerland and then to more countries in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using a distributor helps Eli as an early stage startup so they can outsource things like servicing, deliveries and test drives, says Li.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to revolutionize urban trips, connect cities and communities in a new way that reduces congestion and pollution.,” said Li in a statement. “As urban areas continue to grow along with a rapidly changing climate, opening up a space for micro-EVs like Eli ZERO that is energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The virtual diabetes clinic is designed to provide people living with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes access to personalized care and affordable medications from their homes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founders like to create companies around what they know, and Frank Westermann and Anton Kittelberger know diabetes.</p>
<p>They met and bonded over both having type 1 diabetes — Westermann was diagnosed over 25 years ago — and started the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/11/digital-health-startup-mysugr-gets-4-8m-to-make-diabetes-suck-less/">MySugr</a> app for diabetes self-management in 2012 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/06/mysugr-wins-techcrunch-vienna-as-the-city-proves-its-startups-mettle/">they won a TC pitch-off back in 2011</a>). Four years later, Westermann moved to the U.S. from Austria to introduce MySugr stateside before the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/07/diabetes-platform-mysugr-exits-to-roche-for-as-much-as-100m/">acquired by Roche</a> for $100 million in 2017.</p>
<p>The pair moved on to their next journey, also in diabetes, starting <a href="https://www.9am.health/">9am.health</a> in April, a virtual diabetes clinic designed to provide people living with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes access to personalized care and affordable medications from their homes. 9am.health’s clinic was launched in August.</p>
<p>Today, the San Diego-based company announced a $3.7 million seed round from Founders Fund, Define Ventures, Speedinvest and iSeed Ventures to target the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/10195-1-3-americans-diabetes-2050-cdc.html">1 in 3 people living with diabetes in the United States</a>, Westermann told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We understand the day-to-day challenges that people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes have,” he added. “Access to care is the real issue, and rather than have patients wait weeks to get an appointment, we send a kit with tests to your home, and you send it back to us.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Diabetes platform mySugr exits to Roche for as much as $100M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/07/diabetes-platform-mysugr-exits-to-roche-for-as-much-as-100m/embed/#?secret=BMAEmtdKdz" data-secret="BMAEmtdKdz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>9am.health kicked off in Texas and California, and is now available in 33 states. It is finding patients through digital outreach, community work and hospitals.</p>
<p>Even with insurance, the average person living with diabetes<a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2018/03/20/dci18-0007"> spends about $16,750 per year</a> on medical expenses and has approximately<a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2018/03/20/dci18-0007"> 2.3 times higher</a> the costs than if they didn’t have the disease. Instead, patients can subscribe to 9am.health for $40 per month; that includes online prescription shipping, unlimited personal medical care, medications to manage diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia and at-home lab tests.</p>
<p>Westermann sees other companies working in the diabetes space, but says 9am.health is unique in providing “a digital front door for entire diabetes care,” while others focus on specific pain points. By taking that whole approach, he sees opportunity in going beyond diabetes to the general chronic disease realm as many living with diabetes — 98% of Americans in fact — also have other comorbidities like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and mental health issues, he added.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to grow its team and carve out some of the <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/digital-diabetes-management-market-2021-growth-analysis-top-trends-and-forecasts-till-2027/">digital diabetes market share</a> that was valued at $13 billion in 2020 and is forecasted to grow annually by 18.8% through 2027. 9am.health will also invest in advancing its virtual screening ability and expand the types of medication it can offer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2204649" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204649" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2204649" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg 3839w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BoxClosed_Horizontal-Wood.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204649" class="wp-caption-text">9am.health diabetes kit</p></div></p>
<p>“We want to tear down the barriers and make care as easy as possible and managing diabetes part of life,” Westermann said. “When you live with chronic illness, it is an everyday thing, and sometimes you feel good, and others days you don’t. That’s why we named the company 9am.health because you can wake up at 9 a.m. and start your diabetes journey all over again.”</p>
<p>Lynne Chou O’Keefe, founder and managing partner at Define Ventures, says the future of healthcare is going to be more consumer-focused and will be wrapped around the patient’s care journey. She considers 9am.health to be leading this type of care with a platform that bundles education, community, coaching and care that is direct-to-consumer.</p>
<p>Chou O’Keefe has been investing in healthcare her entire VC career, and sat on the board of Livongo for four years. Through that experience she learned how patients struggle with their care decisions, and finds 9am.health’s founders to have a similar deep expertise and understanding in diabetes, especially with the success they had with MySugr.</p>
<p>“The last place you should receive healthcare is in the doctor’s office, while the first place should be wherever you are,” she added. “This is a very different way than what the healthcare system is today. We feel that people want to manage their diabetes, but then go on and live their lives.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook&#8217;s lead privacy regulator in Europe has raised concerns about a pair of &#8216;smart&#8217; Ray-Ban sunglasses the tech giant is now selling.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s lead privacy regulator in Europe has raised concerns about a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebook-debuts-its-ray-ban-stories-smart-sunglasses/">pair of &#8216;smart&#8217; Ray-Ban sunglasses</a> the tech giant is now selling. The glasses include a face-mounted camera which can be used to take pictures and short videos with a verbal cue.</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) said <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/data-protection-commission-statement-concerning-facebook-view-glasses">Friday</a> that it&#8217;s asked the tech giant to demonstrate that an LED indicator light also mounted on the specs &#8212; which lights up when the user is taking a video &#8212; is an effective way of putting other people on notice that they are being recorded by the wearer.</p>
<p>Italy&#8217;s privacy watchdog, the Garante, already<a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9698698"> raised concerns</a> about Facebook&#8217;s smart glasses &#8212; but Ireland has an outsized role as a regulator for the tech giant owing to where the company&#8217;s regional base is located.</p>
<p>Facebook announced what it couched as the &#8220;next step&#8221; on the road to making a pair of augmented reality &#8216;smart&#8217; glasses a full <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-ar-glasses-2021/">year ago</a> &#8212; saying initial specs would not include any AR but announcing a multi-year partnership luxury eyewear giant Luxottica, as it seemingly planned for a pipeline of increasingly feature-loaded &#8216;smart&#8217; eyewear.</p>
<p>The first Facebook Ray-Ban-branded specs went on sale earlier this month &#8212; looking mostly like a standard pair of sunglasses but containing two 5 MP cameras mounted on the front that enable the user to take video of whatever they&#8217;re looking at and upload it to a new Facebook app called View. (The sunglasses also contain in-frame speakers so the user can listen to music and take phone calls.)</p>
<p>The specs also include a front mounted LED light which is supposed to switch on to indicate when a video is being recorded. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">However European regulators are concerned that what the DPC describes as a &#8220;very small&#8221; indicator is an inadequate mechanism for alerting people to the risk they are being recorded.</span></p>
<p>Facebook has not demonstrated it conducted comprehensive field testing of the device with a view to assessing the privacy risk it may pose, it added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;While it is accepted that many devices including smart phones can record third party individuals, it is generally the case that the camera or the phone is visible as the device by which recording is happening, thereby putting those captured in the recordings on notice. With the glasses, there is a very small indicator light that comes on when recording is occurring. It has not been demonstrated to the DPC and Garante that comprehensive testing in the field was done by Facebook or Ray-Ban to ensure the indicator LED light is an effective means of giving notice,&#8221; the DPC wrote.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s lead EU data protection regulator goes on to say it is calling on the tech giant to &#8220;confirm and demonstrate that the LED indicator light is effective for its purpose and to run an information campaign to alert the public as to how this new consumer product may give rise to less obvious recording of their images&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Facebook has been contacted with questions.</span></p>
<p>It is not clear whether Facebook engaged with any EU privacy regulators during the design of the smart glasses.</p>
<p>Nor whether or when they might launch in Europe.</p>
<p>The specs sent on sale in the US earlier this month &#8212; costing $299. The price to Americans&#8217; privacy is tbc.</p>
<p>Over the years, Facebook has delayed (or even halted) some of its product launches in Europe following regulatory concerns &#8212; including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/facebook-turns-off-facial-recognition-in-the-eu-gets-the-all-clear-from-irelands-data-protection-commissioner-on-its-review/">facial tagging feature</a> (which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/20/just-say-no/">later reintroduced in another form</a>).</p>
<p>The launch of Facebook&#8217;s dating service in Europe was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-dating-launches-in-europe-after-9-month-delay-over-privacy-concerns/">delayed for more than nine months</a> &#8212; and arrived with some claimed changes after an intervention by the DPC.</p>
<p>There are also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/14/whatsapp-will-not-share-user-data-with-facebook-until-it-complies-with-gdpr-ico-closes-investigation/"> ongoing limits</a> on how the Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp can share data with Facebook itself in Europe, again owing to regulatory push back. Although plenty of data does still flow from WhatsApp to Facebook in the EU and &#8212; zooming out &#8212; scores of privacy complaints against the tech giant remain under investigation in the region, meaning these issues are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/">undecided and unenforced</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">Earlier this month</a> Ireland&#8217;s DPC did announce its first decision against a Facebook company (under the EU&#8217;s GDPR)  &#8212; hitting WhatsApp with a $267 penalty related to transparency failures. However the DPC has multiple unresolved complaints against Facebook or Facebook-owned businesses still on its desk.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">January</a> the Irish regulator also agreed to &#8220;swiftly&#8221; resolve a (pre-GDPR) 2013 complaint against Facebook&#8217;s data transfers out of the EU to the US. That <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows/">decision is still pending too</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Speaking of Amazon &#8212; which is reportedly conducting an investigation to find whether its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/amazon-starts-probe-over-bribe-to-govt-officials-by-its-lawyers-in-india-report-says/">lawyers bribed government officials in India</a> &#8212; the company announced today it plans to roll out the voice shopping experience feature in the Hindi language in the South Asian market ahead of the Diwali festival in early November.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant, which rolled out the voice shopping experience in English last year, said the feature in the Hindi language &#8212; which will roll out in “coming weeks” &#8212; will enable users to search for products and check their order status using voice commands such as “joote dikhao,” which is Hindi for ‘show me shoes.’</p>
<p>Only 10% of India’s 1.3 billion people speak English. And in recent years, voice search has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-typing-the-internets-next-billion-users-will-use-video-and-voice-1502116070">dramatically surged in India</a> as many new internet users find it difficult to type on virtual keyboards. Scores of tech companies &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/flipkart-hindi-free-video-streaming/">Amazon&#8217;s rival, Flipkart</a> &#8212; have in recent years made push to add support for more regional languages, or introduce support for voice queries &#8212; and in some cases, do both.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s voice shopping experience will be available to only Android users, the company said.</p>
<p>“Since the launch of voice shopping in 2020, we are humbled to see by the adoption of voice by Amazon.in customers to fulfil their shopping needs has grown by 2X year-on-year. We will continue to focus on bringing new features for our customers on voice to make their shopping experience exciting and fulfilling,” said Kishore Thota, Director of Customer Experience and Marketing at Amazon India, in a statement.</p>
<p>The new rollout is part of a broader localization push from the company. Amazon said today that its website and apps are now also available in Marathi and Bengali. The website already supports five additional regional languages &#8212; Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu.</p>
<p>“Our aim with regional language shopping experience is to make ecommerce accessible, relevant and convenient for customers. Every month, tens of millions of customers visit Amazon.in in regional languages and 90% of the customers are from tier 2 and below cities. This festive season we are happy to expand the Amazon.in experience for our customers in Marathi and Bengali,” said Thota.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet The Ken <a href="https://the-ken.com/story/amazons-alexa-is-building-payments-from-india-for-the-world/">reported last week</a> that Amazon was also working on building a voice-based payments authentication system. The company declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has launched an investigation into the conduct of its legal representatives in India following a complaint from a whistleblower who alleged that one or more of the company&#8217;s reps had bribed government officials, Indian news and analysis outlet the Morning Context <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/amazon-whistleblower-alleges-india-lawyers-bribed-officials">reported on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>The company is investigating whether legal fees financed by it was used for bribing government officials, the report said, which cited unnamed sources and didn&#8217;t identify the government officials. Amazon has placed Rahul Sundaram, a senior corporate counsel, on leave, the <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/amazon-whistleblower-alleges-india-lawyers-bribed-officials">report</a> (paywalled) added.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson said the company has “zero tolerance” for corruption, but didn&#8217;t comment on the investigation.</p>
<p>“We take allegations of improper actions seriously, investigate them fully, and take appropriate action. We are not commenting on specific allegations or the status of any investigation at this time,” the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>India is one of the key overseas markets for Amazon. The American e-commerce firm has invested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">over $6.5 billion in its South Asian nation’s operations</a> and aggressively expanded to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/amazon-announces-250-million-venture-fund-for-indian-startups/">multiple categories in recent years</a>.</p>
<p>The new development comes months after Reuters reported that Amazon had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/indian-trader-group-calls-for-ban-on-amazon-following-dodging-regulations-claims/">secretly favored big sellers</a>, misrepresented its ties with those firms, and used such arrangements to circumvent the South Asian nation&#8217;s foreign investment rules.</p>
<p>Amazon is also subject of an ongoing antitrust investigation in India. A top level executive at the company, which made an unsuccessful attempt to appeal against that investigation, was summoned and questioned earlier this year by local police over allegations that one of its political dramas on Prime Video hurt religious sentiments and caused public anger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/amazon-issues-rare-apology-in-india-over-drama-series/">later issued a rare apology</a> to users in India over the nine-part mini series.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">FloBiz, an Indian startup that is building a neobank for small- and medium-sized businesses in the South Asian market, said on Monday it has raised $31 million in a new financing round as it works to broaden its product offerings.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India and Think Investments co-led the 18-month-old startup’s Series B financing round. Existing investors Elevation Capital and Beenext also participated in the round, which brings <a href="https://flobiz.in">FloBiz</a>&#8216;s all-time raise to over $41 million.</p>
<p>The startup’s marquee offering &#8212; called myBillBook &#8212; helps small- and medium-sized businesses digitize their invoicing, streamline business accounting, and automate workflows of their enterprises.</p>
<p>India, the world’s second largest internet market, is home to millions of small- and medium-sized businesses. Scores of startups have launched neobanks in the country in recent years to focus on serve millennials or businesses.</p>
<p>“SME-focussed neobanks are building engagement with business- clients through their ability to provide solutions like automated invoicing, collections/payments, accounting, inventory and sales management, taxes and in some cases interest on current deposits as well (banks can&#8217;t pay interest). This may help to ramp- up and upfront their monetisation prospects,” analysts at Jefferies wrote in a report to clients last week.</p>
<p>myBillBook, which supports Hindi, Gujarati and Tamil as well as English, will add support for “at least” five more regional languages within the next six months, the startup said, adding that the app has been downloaded over 5 million times.</p>
<p>“The product will also see deeper use of technologies like AI &amp; image processing to make the onboarding process for the less tech-savvy SMB owners in tier 2 and tier 3 cities of India a delightful first step to digital accounting,” the startup said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Scores of high-profile entrepreneurs &#8212; including Vijay Shekhar Sharma of Paytm, Kunal Shah of CRED, Jiten Gupta of Jupiter, Amrish Rau of Pine Labs, Krishnan Menon of BukuKas, and Nitin Gupta of Uni Cards &#8212; have also backed FloBiz in the new financing round.</p>
<p>“Small businesses are the real heroes of our economy. In order to power the SMB economy with technology, one needs deep understanding, instinct and empathy for this audience,” said Tejeshwi Sharma, Managing Director of Sequoia Capital India, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are really impressed by the user centricity, product focus and experimentative approach of the FloBiz founders. There is almost a perfect founder market fit. The team is stoked to partner with FloBiz on their mission of building a neobank for the growing SMBs of India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rahul Raj, co-founder and chief executive of FloBiz, said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to “accelerate projects which have been in the works up till now &#8211; building personalisable modules &amp; features into myBillBook, diversifying core product offerings and preparing to roll out financial services. We have a slew of developments in the pipeline to further delight our SMB partners in the next 12 months.”</p>

<p>Applications are deployed on a global edge network and most of the logic is handled by API calls. The result is a website or an application that loads quickly and can handle a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>Deploying a Jamstack website is quite easy as it often integrates tightly with your Git repository. When you commit code changes, serverless platforms take care of deploying your application. Integrating with API-based developer tools is relatively effortless as well as you don’t manage the logic yourself.</p>
<p>For instance, deploying a website with static content and a Stripe checkout module doesn’t require a ton of effort —&nbsp;Stripe manages the payment servers for you. It gets a bit more complicated if you want to use a live database and interact with it. Traditional database software doesn’t rely on API calls across the internet to add a row, search through multiple rows and find data.</p>
<p>Xata is focusing on databases and want to make it easier to integrate a database with your serverless app. You don’t have to take care of the underlying infrastructure as Xata can scale the database for you. You don’t have to update software, move data to a new server, etc.</p>
<p>Your database is distributed across multiple data centers to improve response times and redundancy. It supports many data types including images. After that, interacting with the database works like any RESTful API out there.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is also drawing some inspiration from popular no-code startups, such as Airtable. You can open your database in a web browser and interact with your data directly from there. For instance, you can filter the current view, sort data using a specific criteria and get the API query that you can use in your code.</p>
<p>If you store a lot of data in your database, you can search through your data using a free-text search feature. You can also leverage Xata for analytics by creating charts and visualizations.</p>
<p>The ability to interact with your data from a web browser is Xata’s competitive advantage. Many companies rely on Airtable as their first backend to prototype a new project. Xata could become a production-ready version of this Airtable-as-a-backend data management model.</p>
<p>The $5 million round was led by Index Ventures. Operator Collective, SV Angel, X-Factor and firstminute capital also participated. Some business angels, such as Shay Banon and Uri Boness from Elastic, Neha Narkhede from Confluent, Guillermo Rauch from Vercel, Elad Gil from Color Genomics and Christian Bach and Mathias Biilmann from Netlify also invested.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by Monica Sarbu, who used to be the Director of Engineering at Elastic. So she probably knows a thing or two about scaling databases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The used car market is getting another major infusion of venture capital today, with one of the faster scaling startups out of India picking up a major round of financing to double down on growth: <a href="https://www.cars24.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cars24</a> &#8212; a site and app that sells users cars and used two-wheeled motorbikes &#8212; has raised $450 million, a Series F of $340 million and $110 million in debt. The investment values Cars24 at $1.84 billion post-money, the company said, making it one of the more valuable privately-held used car startups globally.</p>
<p>DST Global, Falcon Edge and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 co-led the Series F, with Tencent and existing investors Moore Strategic Ventures and Exor Seeds also participating.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The debt round came from a mix of financial institutions. This fundraise, now confirmed and official, was <a href="https://www.vccircle.com/cars24-raises-fresh-funding-from-softbank-others/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> in past weeks, although at a smaller amount: it didn&#8217;t include the debt portion, and some reports were based on regulatory filings for less than the sum ultimately raised.</span></p>
<p>Vikram Chopra, the CEO who co-founded the company in Gurugram with Mehul Agrawal, Ruchit Agarwal and Gajendra Jangid, said that the plan will be to use the funds across a range of areas.</p>
<p>They include national and international expansion (it&#8217;s already operating in India, Australia and UAE, and has its eyes on more markets); technology (specifically areas like further expanding its virtual appraisal process, as well as more data science around pricing and other details related to sales and after-sales); and financing both to buy in vehicles, as well as to help consumers make purchasing a vehicle a viable economic option.</p>
<p>Cars24 is active more than 200 cities in India, and it has sold 400,000 vehicles to date (both cars and motorbikes) with upwards of 13 million monthly visitors on its site. All this gives it claim to being the largest platform of its kind in India. But its ambition is to improve the inefficiencies of selling a car, or buying a used car, in many parts of the globe, not just its home market.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Buying or selling a car is hard anywhere in the world,&#8221; Chopra said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a broken experience everywhere, so we are trying to solve for this.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">This is also where the financing and technology figure significantly. When Cars24 first started out in 2015 in India, Chopra said, it faced the added issue (or opportunity?) of a tricky economic landscape with very low car ownership penetration overall &#8212; just 2%, or 2 cars per 100 people, compared to typically between 50 and 80 cars per 100 people in Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;But buying a used car in India is a way for a person to own <em>any</em> car,&#8221; Chopra said. In a country like India, &#8220;we want to take the penetration to 10 or 15.&#8221; He added that the car resale market today in India is around $25 billion, but is on track to soon get to $100 billion.</p>
<p class="p1">Cars24 has been built around a &#8220;buying-in, fixing up, and then reselling&#8221; model similar to that of the real-estate juggernaut Opendoor: it appraises vehicles from individuals looking to sell them; buys them up if an agreed price can be reached; reconditions them; and then re-sells and delivers them to new owners. This model, Chopra said, gives Cars24 an edge over some of the shortcomings that exist with traditional players (both on and offline).</p>
<p>First, it provides a centralized platform, cars24.com and its corresponding app, where users can browse a one-stop-shop inventory that goes beyond their local areas (and local dealers). That inventory is curated and made discoverable using a number of algorithms, and pricing is also determined by Cars24&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>“Cars24 is building a data-enabled tech platform that is organizing the fragmented used car market in India,&#8221; said Munish Varma, managing partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. &#8220;We have been closely tracking its approach and efforts that have disrupted the used car retailing in India.”</p>
<p>“We believe Cars24 is enhancing the customer experience in the used car industry with its sharp focus on technology,&#8221; said Sumer Juneja, partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. &#8220;We will continue to support this growth given our expertise in e-commerce businesses across markets”.</p>
<p>Second, when consumers do make a purchase, they can keep and try out a vehicle for up to seven days &#8220;and return it if you don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, Chopra continued, is in contrast to other used-car sales sites, as well as physical dealers: either they don&#8217;t offer trial runs, or (in the case of physical dealers or individual offline sellers), they might give a driver 10 or 15 minutes tops, with someone attending you as you drive the vehicle around: not a great way to discover what you like or don&#8217;t like about a vehicle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a model that investors believe will give Cars24 an edge over competitors.</p>
<p>“We have studied used car platforms globally and are struck by the similarities we see between Cars24 and analogous businesses that have scaled successfully,&#8221; said Navroz D. Udwadia, co-founder of Falcon Edge Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Cars24 has cemented its first-mover advantage by building wide-ranging supply side moats, which in turn drive demand liquidity on the platform. In positioning itself as a buying and selling solution for consumers, Cars24 drives immense top-of-mind recall. It is rare to find a business as focused on the consumer experience and as driven to ensure it is outstanding via the use of data science and technology. Finally, we are deeply impressed by the founders’ leadership, and are thrilled to back them as they transform the used car industry in India and scale internationally across MENA and SE Asia.&#8221;</p>
<p>A used-vehicle sales platform raising a huge amount of money is somewhat ironic given some of the bigger trends in the world of transportation.</p>
<p>Some have theorized that a wave of factors &#8212; they include the rise of ubiquitous e-hailing apps like Uber; on-demand car-sharing services like Getaround or Zipcar; a push in urban centers encouraging people to use a wider array of transportation options to offset traffic; and bigger environmental trends that are leading some to eschew gas guzzling autos &#8212; would push the world <em>away </em>from car ownership. Yet essentially, Cars24 (and others like it) are extending the life of a lot of older models to keep more vehicles in circulation and private hands.</p>
<p>But using Uber can get pricey and is not the same as having your own wheels, and the desire to have your own vehicle is perhaps at a high-point right now because of Covid-19 and people concerned about spreading or catching the virus, Chopra said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely not the case in India that less people want to own cars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;During the pandemic, we have seen a lot of demand, in India specifically.&#8221; On new, greener vehicle technology, this is also interesting and will simply present another class of vehicles on Cars24 as adoption of electric vehicles increases, he added. But it&#8217;s not all quite there, yet.</p>
<p>The strength of the current opportunity is partly why it seems that we&#8217;ve found ourselves crowded with startups and scale-ups hoping to define the new generation of used-car-sale platforms.</p>
<p>Others in the same space that have recently raised money include close competitors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/indias-spinny-raises-65-million-to-expand-its-online-platform-for-selling-used-cars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinny</a>, also out of India; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/uks-cazoo-will-list-on-the-nyse-by-way-of-a-spac-valuing-it-at-7b-and-raising-1-6b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cazoo</a> in the UK, which has now gone public; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/brazilian-digital-auto-marketplace-instacarro-revs-up-with-23m-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InstaCarro</a> out of Brazil; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/mexican-unicorn-kavak-raises-a-485m-series-d-at-a-4b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kavak</a> out of Mexico; and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2021/09/01/malaysias-carsome-reaches-13-billion-valuation-in-funding-round-from-mediatek-and-others/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carsome</a> from Malaysia, among many others. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVNA?p=CVNA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carvana</a>, one of the biggest used-car platforms, is also publicly listed and is now valued at nearly $28 billion.</p>
<p>What has been interesting is that each of these big players have up to now carved out very strong markets for themselves in their home countries, and they are only more recently moving to expand internationally. Cars24 has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in funding (it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/business/startups/news/cars24-is-indias-latest-unicorn-as-it-raises-200-million-from-dst-global-and-existing-investors/articleshow/79388631.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also raised $200 million</a> less than a year ago) in part because its investors think it has what it takes to export, and thus scale, its model beyond the huge market of India.</p>
<p>“Cars24 is at the forefront of transforming the way consumers buy and sell cars by providing a unique end-to-end digital shopping and transaction experience,&#8221; said Rahul Mehta, managing partner at DST Global, in a statement. &#8220;They have emerged as the undisputed leader in the used car space in India and early traction in international markets is exceeding expectations. We love backing founders who are bold and ambitious thinkers and couldn’t be more excited to enter the second innings of our long-lasting partnership with Cars24.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to change, at Cars24&#8217;s request, its description as &#8216;marketplace&#8217; and the number of active cities to 200 from 130. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taha-ahmed-8884a292/">Taha Ahmed</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rooshan-aziz-04710875/">Rooshan Aziz</a> left their jobs in strategy consulting and investment banking in London earlier this year in order to found a mobile-only education platform startup, <a href="https://maqsad.io/">Maqsad</a>, in Pakistan, with a goal &#8220;to make education more accessible to 100 million Pakistani students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having grown up in Karachi, childhood friends Ahmed and Aziz are aware of the challenges about the Pakistani education system, which is notably worse for those not living in large urban areas (the nation’s student-teacher ratio is 44:1). Pakistani children are less likely to go to school for each kilometer of distance between school and their home &#8212; with girls being four times affected, Maqsad co-founder Aziz said.</p>
<p>Maqsad announced today its $2.1 million pre-seed round to enhance its content platform growth and invest in R&amp;D.</p>
<p>The pre-seed round, which was completed in just three weeks via virtual meetings, was led by Indus Valley Capital, with participation from Alter Global, Fatima Gobi Ventures and several angel investors from Pakistan, the Middle East and Europe.</p>
<p>Maqsad will use the proceeds for developing in-house content, such as production studio, academics and animators, as well as bolstering R&amp;D and engineering, Aziz told TechCrunch. The company will focus on the K-12 education in Pakistan, including 11th and 12th grade math, with plans to expand into other STEM subjects for the next one-two years, Aziz said.</p>
<p>Maqsad&#8217;s platform, which provides a one-stop shop for after-school academic content in a mix of English and Urdu, will be supplemented by quizzes and other gamified features that will come together to offer a personalized education to individuals. Its platform features include adaptive testing that alter a question&#8217;s level of difficulty depending on users’ responses, Aziz explained.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;maqsad&#8221; means purpose in Urdu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe everyone has a purpose. Maqsad&#8217;s mission is to enable Pakistani students to realize this purpose; whether you are a student from an urban centre, such as Lahore, or from a remote village in Sindh: Maqsad believes in equal opportunity for all,&#8221; Aziz said.</p>
<p>“We are building a mobile-first platform, given that 95% of broadband users in Pakistan are via mobile. Most other platforms are not mobile optimized,&#8221; Aziz added.</p>

<p>“It’s about more than just getting students to pass their exams. We want to start a revolution in the way Pakistani students learn, moving beyond rote memorization to a place of real comprehension,” said co-founder Taha Ahmed, who was a former strategy consultant at LEK.</p>
<p>The company ran small pilots in April and May and started full-scale operations on 26 July, Aziz said, adding that Maqsad will launch its mobile app, currently under development, in the coming months in Q4 2021 and has a waitlist for early access.</p>
<p>“Struggles of students during the early days of the pandemic motivated us to run a pilot. With promising initial traction and user feedback, the size of the opportunity to digitize the education sector became very clear,” Aziz said.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the education industry, heating up the global edtech startups that made online education more accessible for a wider population, for example in countries like India and Indonesia, Aziz mentioned.</p>
<p>The education market size in Pakistan is estimated at $12 billion and is projected to increase to $30 billion by 2030, according to Aziz.</p>
<p>It plans to build the company as a hybrid center offering online and offline courses like Byju&#8217;s and Aakash, and expand classes for adults such as MasterClass, the U.S.-based online classes for adults, as its long-term plans, Aziz said.</p>
<p>“Maqsad founders’ deep understanding of the problem, unique approach to solving it and passion for impact persuaded us quickly,” the founder and managing partner of Indus Valley Capital, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aatifawan/">Aatif Awan</a>, said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pakistan&#8217;s edtech opportunity is one of the largest in the world and we are excited to back Maqsad in delivering tech-powered education that levels access, quality and across Pakistan&#8217;s youth and creates lasting social change,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-mukhtar-842327139/?originalSubdomain=pk">Ali Mukhtar</a>, general partner of Fatima Gobi Ventures said.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ess-andrew-tang/">Andrew Tang</a> is vice president of energy storage and optimization at <a href="https://www.wartsila.com/energy">Wärtsilä Energy</a>, which provides solutions for renewable energy integration and EV charging infrastructure development.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As electric vehicles (EVs) become the new standard, charging infrastructure will become a commonplace detail blending into the landscape, available in a host of places from a range of providers: privately run charging stations, the office parking lot, home garages and government-provided locations to fill in the gaps. We need a new energy blueprint for the United States in order to maintain a stable grid to support this national move to EV charging.</p>
<p>The Biden administration announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/">500,000 charging stations</a> to be installed nationally and additional <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/">energy storage</a> to facilitate the shift to EVs. Integrating all of this new infrastructure and transitioning requires balancing the traffic on the grid and managing increased energy demand that stretches beyond power lines and storage itself.</p>
<p>The majority of EV infrastructure pulls its power from the grid, which will add significant demand when it reaches scale. In an ideal situation, EV charging stations will have their own renewable power generation co-located with storage, but new programs and solutions are needed in order to make it available everywhere. A <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/4-emerging-ways-pair-electric-vehicles-and-renewable-energy">range of scenarios</a> for how renewables can be used to power EV charging have been piloted in the U.S. in recent years. Eventually, EVs will likely even <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-04-27/more-evs-are-being-designed-to-push-power-to-the-electrical-grid">provide power to the grid</a>.</p>
<p>These technological advances will happen as we progress through the energy transition; regardless, EV infrastructure will heavily rely on the U.S. grid. That makes coordination across a range of stakeholders and behavior change among the general public essential for keeping the grid stable while meeting energy demand.</p>
<p>The White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/">fact sheet for EV charging infrastructure</a> points to a technical blueprint that the Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute will be working on together. It is critical that utilities, energy management and storage stakeholders, and the general public be included in planning — here’s why.</p>
<h2>Stakeholder collaboration</h2>
<p>Charging infrastructure is currently fragmented in the U.S. Much of it is privatized and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan">there are complaints</a> that unless you drive a Tesla, it is hard to find charging while on the road. Some EV owners have even returned to driving gas-powered vehicles. There’s reason to be hopeful that this will rapidly change.</p>
<p>ChargePoint and EVgo are two companies that will likely become household names as their EV networks expand. A coalition made up of some of the largest U.S. utilities &#8212; including American Electric Power, Dominion Energy, Duke Energy, Entergy, Southern Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority &#8212; called the Electric Highway Coalition, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aep-dominion-energy-duke-energy-entergy-southern-company-and-tva-plan-to-add-electric-vehicle-fast-chargers-to-connect-gulf-coast-midwest-and-atlantic-state-destinations-301238938.html">announced</a> plans for a regional network of charging stations spanning their utility territories.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Networks that swap out private gas stations for EV charging is one piece of the puzzle. We also need to ensure that everyone has affordable access and that charging times are staggered &#8212; this is one of the core concerns on every stakeholder’s mind. Having charging available in a range of places spreads out demand, helping keep power available and the grid balanced.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EV charging solutions will become an asset, not a liability, to the grid&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/ev-charging-solutions-will-become-an-asset-not-a-liability-to-the-grid/embed/#?secret=DXob3z3iNL" data-secret="DXob3z3iNL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Varying consumer needs including location and housing, work schedules and economic situations require considerations and new solutions that make EVs and charging accessible to everyone. What works in the suburbs won’t suit rural or urban areas, and just imagine someone who works the night shift in a dense urban area.</p>
<p>Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/">plan</a> includes, “$4 million to encourage strong partnerships and new programs to increase workplace charging regionally or nationally, which will help increase the feasibility of [plug-in electric vehicle] ownership for consumers in underserved communities.” Partnerships and creative solutions will equally be needed.</p>
<h2>An opportunity to fully engage technologies we already have</h2>
<p>“Fifty percent of the reductions we have to make to get to net-zero by 2050 or 2045 are going to come from technologies that we don&#8217;t yet have,&#8221; John Kerry <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2021/05/17/climate-change-technologt-john-kerry/">said</a> recently, causing a stir. He later clarified that we also have technologies now that we need to put to work, which received less air time. In reality, we are just getting started in utilizing existing renewable and energy transition technologies; we have yet to realize their full potential.</p>
<p>Currently, utility-scale and distributed energy storage are used for their most simplistic capabilities, that is, jumping in when energy demand reaches its peak and helping keep the grid stable through services referred to as balancing and frequency regulation. But as renewable energy penetration increases and loads such as EVs are electrified, peak demand will be exacerbated.</p>
<p>The role that storage plays for EV charging stations seems well understood. On-site storage is used daily to provide power for charging cars at any given time. Utility-scale storage has the same capabilities and can be used to store and then supply renewable power to the grid in large quantities every day to help balance the demand of EVs.</p>
<p>A stable power system for EVs combines utilities and utility-scale storage with a network of subsystems where energy storage is co-located with EV charging. All of the systems are coordinated and synchronized to gather and dispatch energy at different times of the day based on all the factors that affect grid stability and the availability of renewable power. That synchronization is handled by intelligent energy management software that relies on sophisticated algorithms to forecast and respond to changes within fractions of a second.</p>
<p>This model also makes it possible to manage the cost of electricity and EV demand on the grid. Those subsystems could be municipal-owned locations in lower-income areas. Such a subsystem would collect power in its storage asset and set the price locally on its own terms. These systems could incentivize residents to power up there at certain times of the day in order to make charging more affordable by providing an alternative to the real-time cost of electricity during peak demand when using a home outlet, for example.</p>
<h2>Behavior change</h2>
<p>The greatest challenge for utilities will be how to manage EV loads and motivate people to stagger charging their vehicles, rather than everyone waiting until they are home in the evening during off-peak renewable generation periods. If everyone plugged in at the same time, we&#8217;d end up cooking dinner in the dark.</p>
<p>While there’s been talk of incentivizing the public to charge at different times and spread out demand, motivators vary among demographics. With the ability to charge at home and skip a trip to the “gas station” &#8212; or “power station,” as it may be referred to in the future &#8212; many people will choose convenience over cost.</p>
<p>The way we currently operate, individual energy usage seems like an independent, isolated event to consumers and households. EVs will require everyone &#8212; from utilities and private charging stations to consumers &#8212; to be more aware of demand on the grid and act more as communities sharing energy.</p>
<p>Thus, a diverse charging network alone won’t solve the issue of overtaxing the grid. A combination of a new blueprint for managing energy on the grid plus behavior change is needed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><i>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><i>subscribe here. </i></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BetterUp, a reskilling and coaching platform for employees before and beyond the C-suite, is getting in touch with its emotions. This week, the richly funded unicorn startup announced a pair of acquisitions in the emotional artificial intelligence and people management space: </span><a href="https://www.motivesoftware.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.impraise.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impraise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BetterUp announced its acquisitions after a busy stint, which included passing $100 million in annual recurring revenue, expanding to Europe, and hitting 1 million individual coaching sessions on its platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll be honest. It’s par for the course to see a growth-stage startup use milestones to inorganically expand through acquisitions. How else do you grow into your valuation? BetterUp’s duo of deals still stood out to me because they signal a somewhat unconventional direction for where the coaching industry is going. Stay with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BetterUp claims that it pioneered the category of coaching by focusing on employees, not just C-suite executives. With these acquisitions, it’s shifting how that coaching looks and lives. Motive, for example, will help BetterUp clients understand the emotional context behind data that they already aggregate, through engagement surveys or polls. It’s a plug-and-play approach that helps employers more immediately act on employee sentiment, instead of waiting for the long-game of coaching to play out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other end of the funnel, Impraise uses technology to help managers better support their direct reports, through real-time performance reviews and more seamless feedback channels. Like Motive, Impraise is a step outside of the traditional boundaries of what coaching looks like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The direct-report relationship is where change happens in people&#8217;s lives,” BetterUp CEO and co-founder Alexi Robichaux said. “It doesn&#8217;t actually happen in coaching sessions; change happens after.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some ways, these acquisitions are BetterUp admitting that coaching for all employees has to be an end-to-end solution that requires everyone in the company &#8211; from HR to managers &#8211; to be involved. It can’t be a weekly calendar invite. This sort of investment could cause employers to shy away from even offering services to their staff to begin with, but pressure to retain may force them to try anyways. For other coaching and up-skilling platforms, the bar continues to be raised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coaching can be a point solution, but that&#8217;s not enough and we know that better than anyone because we invented the point solution,” Robichaux said. “If you don’t have the data platform, if you don’t have the outcomes. If you don’t have the AI to personalize this, you can go coach 50 managers at your company,” but not every employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the rest of this newsletter, I’ll walk us through Atlanta’s big bootstrapped moment, Casper’s nightmare and Apple’s day. As always, you can find me on Twitter </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@nmasc_ </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and listen to my podcast, </span><a href="https://t.co/XN3y0gbB6b?amp=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity.</span></a></p>
<h2>Atlanta’s big bootstrapped moment</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step aside Austin and Miami, Atlanta is in town. All eyes were on the city this week after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intuit bought local business Mailchimp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a staggering $12 billion. The Atlanta-based email marketing company never took any outside funding, which meant the deal was one of the biggest ever for a bootstrapped company. And while some saw </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/intuits-12b-mailchimp-acquisition-is-about-expanding-its-small-business-focus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mailchimp’s massive exit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a win for the Atlanta startup and venture ecosystem, others felt differently. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="b9tcWoLKcE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/">Intuit confirms $12B deal to buy Mailchimp</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Intuit confirms $12B deal to buy Mailchimp&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/embed/#?secret=b9tcWoLKcE" data-secret="b9tcWoLKcE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><b>Here’s what to know:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Part of Mailchimp’s strategy as an untraditional tech company included not giving Mailchimp employees equity, and prioritizing profit-sharing as well as higher salaries. It sounds good, until your startup exits for $12 billion and you realize you don’t have any equity in the business that you helped build. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/a-knock-against-bootstrapping/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a knock against bootstrapping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as we discussed during Equity. Employees spoke to Business Insider </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mailchimp-insiders-react-to-employees-getting-no-equity-2021-9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about their first reactions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, answering if the deal does indeed empower the local ecosystem.  </span></p>

<h2>Casper’s nightmare</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1802467" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1802467" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1802467 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png 2259w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=1536,816 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=2048,1088 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/unicorn-falling_preview.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1802467" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My scoop this week uncovered that Casper, the direct-to-consumer mattress company, had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/casper-cuts-its-cmo-cto-and-coo-amid-further-layoffs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another round of layoffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that impacted two dozen employees, as well as its CMO, CTO and COO. The round of layoffs and executive shuffle comes a little over a year since Casper cut 21% of its workforce and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/casper-winds-down-european-operations-and-lays-off-78-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down its European operations. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easy take here is that Casper is struggling with management and direction and has been on its back foot </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/3-unicorn-takeaways-from-the-casper-one-medical-ipos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">since its public debut last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, I’d argue that there’s more nuance here.</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s what to know: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One founder in the direct-to-consumer space, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to her lack of direct knowledge with the company said that Casper’s layoffs could also be a response to Apple’s iOS 14.5 update, which will crack down on apps that track users’ data without permission. The setting restricts the advertising data that companies can access, making it harder to justify budget and understand the efficacy of their sales strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For DTC companies, the uncertainty of in-person retail activity plus difficulty of advertising attribution is a challenging hurdle to surpass.</span></p>

The TechCrunch team, of course, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/live-from-apples-virtual-2021-iphone-event/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">couldn’t resist a chance to live blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><b>Here’s what to know: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was all about the new iPhone 13. Brian Heater explained the context around the launch </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and what’s actually new about the smartphone. </span></a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year’s iPhone 12 was a massive seller, bucking the trend of stagnating smartphone sales, in part due to a bottleneck in sales from the unplanned delay, but also because it finally brought 5G connectivity to Apple’s mobile line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucky number iPhone 13 (no skipping for superstition’s sake, mind) features a familiar design. The front notch has finally been shrunken — now 20% smaller than its predecessor — while the rear-facing camera system has also gotten a redesign. The screen is now 28% brighter, Super Retina XDR display on both the iPhone 13 and 13 mini at 1200 nits.</span></p></blockquote>

<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p>When you get deep enough into the tech industry, it&#8217;s harder to look at things with a consumer&#8217;s set of eyes. I&#8217;ve felt that way more and more after six years watching Apple events as a TechCrunch reporter, but sometimes <a href="https://twitter.com/UptownDC_Rich/status/1438841983842328580?s=20">memes</a> from random Twitter accounts help me find the consumer truth I&#8217;m looking for.</p>
<p>As that dumb little tweet indicates, Apple is charging toward a future where it&#8217;s becoming a little harder to distinguish new from old. The off-year &#8220;S&#8221; period of old is no more for the iPhone, which has seen tweaks and new size variations since 2017&#8217;s radical iPhone X redesign. Apple is stretching the periods between major upgrades for its entire product line and it&#8217;s also taking longer to roll out those changes.</p>
<p>Apple debuted the current bezel-lite iPad Pro design back in late 2018 and it&#8217;s taken three years for the design to work its way down to the iPad mini while the entry-level iPad is still lying in wait. The shift from M1 Macs will likely take years as the company has already detailed. Most of Apple&#8217;s substantial updates rely on upgrades to the chipsets that they build, something that increasingly makes them look and feel like a consumer chipset company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a new trend, or even a new take, it&#8217;s been written lots of times, but it&#8217;s particularly interesting as the company bulks up the number of employees dedicated to future efforts like augmented reality, which will one day soon likely replace the iPhone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an evolution that&#8217;s pushing them into a similar design territory as action camera darling GoPro, which has struggled again and again with getting their core loyalists to upgrade their hardware frequently. These are on laughably different scales, with Apple now worth some $2.41 trillion and GoPro still fighting for a $1.5 billion market cap. The situations are obviously different, and yet they are both facing similar end-of-life innovation questions for categories that they both have mastered.</p>
<p>This week GoPro debuted its HERO10 Black camera, which brings higher frame rates and a better performing processor as it looks to push more of its user audience to subscription services. Sound familiar? This week, Apple debuted its new flagship, the iPhone 13 Pro, with a faster processor and better frame rates (for the display not the camera here, though). They also spent a healthy amount of time pushing users to embrace new services ecosystems.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s devices are getting so good that they&#8217;re starting to reach a critical feature plateau. The company has still managed to churn out device after device and expand their audience to billions while greatly expanding their average revenue per user. Things are clearly going pretty well for the most valuable company on earth, but while the stock has nearly quadrupled since the iPhone X launch, the consumer iPhone experience feels pretty consistent. That&#8217;s clearly not a bad thing, but it is &#8212; for lack of a better term &#8212; boring.</p>
<p>The clear difference, among 2.4 trillion others, is that GoPro doesn&#8217;t seem to have a clear escape route from its action camera vertical.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But Apple has been pushing thousands of employees toward an escape route in augmented reality, even if the technology is clearly not ready for consumers and they&#8217;re forced to lead with what has been rumored to be a several-thousand-dollar AR/VR headset with plenty of limitations. One of the questions I&#8217;m most interested in is what the iPhone device category looks likes once its unwieldy successor has reared its head. Most likely is that the AR-centric devices will be shipped as wildly expensive iPhone accessories and a way to piggy back off the accessibility of the mobile category while providing access to new &#8212; and more exciting &#8212; experiences. In short, AR is the future of the iPhone until AR doesn&#8217;t need the iPhone anymore. </span></p>

<h2>other things</h2>
<p><em>Here are the TechCrunch news stories that especially caught my eye this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-event-this-morning/"><b>Everything Apple announced this week</b></a><br />
Was it the most exciting event Apple has ever had? Nah. Are you still going to click that link to read about their new stuff? Yah.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gopro-debuts-the-hero10-black-action-camera/"><b>GoPro launches the HERO10 Black</b></a><br />
I have a very soft spot in my heart for GoPro, which has taken a niche corner of hardware and made a device and ecosystem that&#8217;s really quite good. As I mentioned above, the company has some issues making significant updates every year, but they made a fairly sizable upgrade this year with the second-generation of their customer processor and some performance bumps across the board.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/tesla-will-open-controversial-fsd-beta-software-to-owners-with-a-good-driving-record/">Tesla will open FSD beta to drivers with good driving record</a><br />
</b>Elon Musk is pressing ahead with expanding its &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; software to more Tesla drivers, saying that users who paid for the FSD system can apply to use the beta and will be analyzed by the company&#8217;s insurance calculator bot. After 7 days of good driving behavior, Musk says users will be approved.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/opensea-admits-incident-as-top-exec-is-accused-of-trading-nfts-on-insider-information/"><b>OpenSea exec resigns after &#8216;insider trading&#8217; scandal</b></a><br />
NFTs are a curious business; there&#8217;s an intense amount of money pulsating through these markets &#8212; and little oversight. This week OpenSea, the so-called &#8220;eBay of NFTs,&#8221; detailed that its own VP of Product had been trading on insider information. He was later pushed to resign.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/apple-and-google-bow-to-pressure-in-russia-to-remove-kremlin-critics-tactical-voting-app/"><b>Apple and Google bow to the Kremlin</b></a><br />
Apple and Google are trying to keep happy the governments of most every market in which they operate. That leads to some uncomfortable situations in markets like Russia, where both tech giants were forced by the Kremlin to remove a political app from the country&#8217;s major opposition party.</p>

<h2>extra things</h2>
<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our Extra Crunch subscription service this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/what-could-stop-the-startup-boom/"><strong>What could stop the startup boom?</strong></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;We’ve seen record results from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">cities</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">countries</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">regions</a>. There’s so much money sloshing around the venture capital and startup worlds that it’s hard to recall what they were like in leaner times. We’ve been in a bull market for tech upstarts for so long that it feels like the only possible state of affairs. It’s not&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/the-value-of-software-revenue-may-have-finally-stopped-rising/"><b>The value of software revenue may have finally stopped rising</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;I’ve held back from covering the value of software (SaaS, largely) revenues for a few months after spending a bit too much time on it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/what-the-hell-saas-valuations/">in preceding quarters</a> — when VCs begin to point out that you could just swap out numbers quarter to quarter and write the same post, it’s time for a break. But the value of software revenues posted a simply incredible run, and I can’t say “no” to a chart&#8230;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/inside-gitlabs-ipo-filing/"><b>Inside GitLab&#8217;s IPO filing</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;The company’s IPO has therefore been long expected. In its last primary transaction, GitLab <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/gitlab-hauls-in-268m-series-e-on-2-768b-valuation/">raised $286 million</a> at a post-money valuation of $2.75 billion, per <a href="http://pitchbook.com/">PitchbBook data</a>. The same information source also notes that GitLab <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/gitlab-oversaw-a-195-million-secondary-sale-that-values-the-company-at-6-billion/">executed a secondary transaction</a> earlier this year worth $195 million, which gave the company a $6 billion valuation&#8230;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business.

<p>Apple this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-fall-event-2021/">introduced</a> its updated iPhone 13 lineup, which includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/">iPhone 13 in pretty new shades</a>, an iPhone mini, and the more powerful <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/the-iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-features-120hz-display-better-cameras/">iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max</a>. Consumers may care most about the battery life improvements &#8212; 1.5 hours longer on iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 13 Pro; 2.5 hours more on iPhone 13 and Pro Max, compared with their respective iPhone 12 models. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-brings-macro-low-light-and-cinema-focused-updates-to-the-iphone-13-pro-camera/">Cameras got a decent upgrade</a>, powered by the A15 Bionic, which enables additions like &#8220;Cinematic Mode&#8221; (a mode that allows you to change focus between subjects). Plus, Pro models can do macro photography and now include support for ProRes video recording at 1080p 30 fps with the 128GB storage option and up to 4K 30 fps with 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage options. (Yes, there&#8217;s a 1TB iPhone now, and no more 64GB models. Hooray!)</p>

<p>The bigger news in terms of hardware, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/apple-refreshes-ipad-mini-with-a-new-design-5g-and-an-8-3-inch-display/">was the iPad mini</a> ($499+), aka the BIG iPhone, which got a significant update. The new device has an 8.3-inch display, front and rear-facing 12-megapixel cameras, 80% faster performance with the A15 Bionic, 40% faster CPU, support for 5G, and it adds a USB-C port and a relocated Touch ID that&#8217;s now on the top button. It also now supports Center Stage and Apple Pencil (2nd generation.) It&#8217;s also available in new finishes: space gray, pink, purple and starlight.</p>
<p>Apple noted there are more than 1 million apps designed specifically for iPad devices. The full App Store has 2.22 million or more, according to various <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/">estimates</a>. A popular and affordable iPad mini could encourage more development beyond the iPhone.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-event-this-morning/">announcements</a> included a new standard iPad with spec bumps, a new Apple Watch Series 7 with a slightly bigger screen and fall detection for cyclists, an updated Fitness+ with Pilates and meditation, and a nifty MagSafe Wallet that will track the location where it was separated from your iPhone.</p>
<h3>Apple sherlocks Watch keyboard apps</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2204396" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204396" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2204396" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-17-at-12.21.18-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="387" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-17-at-12.21.18-PM.jpg 2862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-17-at-12.21.18-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-17-at-12.21.18-PM.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-17-at-12.21.18-PM.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-17-at-12.21.18-PM.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-17-at-12.21.18-PM.jpg?resize=1536,875 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-17-at-12.21.18-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1166 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-17-at-12.21.18-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204396" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> FlickType</p></div></p>
<p>Frustrated iOS developer Kosta Eleftheriou, who is already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">engaging in a legal battle</a> with Apple over money lost to App Store scams and other matters, <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1437845736951992321">couldn&#8217;t hold back his frustration</a> when he saw Apple announce its new Apple Watch Series 7 would now sport a familiar-looking keyboard. Eleftheriou&#8217;s own <a href="https://www.flicktype.com/">FlickType</a> keyboard app for Apple Watch was repeatedly rejected from the App Store for months on end, causing a lengthy delay in getting his app to market. The developer also claims to have had conversations with Apple execs about his keyboard app, which he says was once even considered an acquisition target.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s position on the matter is that it had to remove Eleftheriou&#8217;s app due to guidelines it had at the time prohibiting keyboard extensions, which the company had on the books due to what it believed would offer a poor consumer experience on earlier versions of Apple Watch, which had a smaller screen. These guidelines were later dropped once Apple learned of the app’s accessibility functions, which allowed the app to be published.</p>
<p>One question &#8212; which would have to either be worked out through the discovery process in court or through some sort of congressional investigation &#8212; is how long Apple had a Watch keyboard design on its product roadmap? Was Apple rejecting a third-party Watch keyboard app (and others like it, to be clear) over this purported &#8220;poor experience&#8221; at a time when Apple was actively designing its own keyboard UI? And how could there be a corporate firewall in place between App Store review activity and the company&#8217;s own plans, if Apple was considering an acquisition of FlickType at the time, as the lawsuit alleges?</p>
<p>Eleftheriou has a difficult path ahead of him going up against Apple&#8217;s legal team, but he&#8217;s more motivated than ever now. &#8220;See you in court, @Apple&#8221; he tweeted after the Watch reveal.</p>

<h3>App Annie charged with securities fraud</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-176"> charged App Annie</a>, as well as its co-founder and former CEO and Chairman Bertrand Schmitt, with securities fraud. App Annie and Schmitt have agreed to pay over $10 million to settle the fraud charges which are related to “deceptive practices and making material misrepresentations about how App Annie’s alternative data was derived,” the SEC said. The charges have to do with how App Annie used non-aggregated and non-anonymized data to alter its model-generated estimates to be more accurate, while telling trading firms that protections were in place against the misuse of confidential data. (More details and the full complaint can be read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">here on TechCrunch</a>.)</p>
<p>In response to the bombshell news, one competitor has spoken up. Apptopia co-founder and CEO Jonathan Kay <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/statement-on-data-integrity-and-recent-industry-news">wrote about how</a> his firm took the time to build the company and data estimates &#8220;the right way,&#8221; which is why some of its estimates in the past hadn&#8217;t been accurate. (It wasn&#8217;t cheating the system.) This proved to be the better strategy. &#8220;We did not take shortcuts to spur breakneck scale; oftentimes founders feel the pressure to do so to meet unrealistic Board, VC or Market expectations. We haven’t and we don’t,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Appfigures shared a similar sentiment, adding they were disappointed to hear the news and hoped the actions didn&#8217;t erode trust in the industry. &#8220;Strict privacy has been one of our founding principles and has served our users and us well for 12 years. We believe the trust of our users is our most valuable asset,&#8221; t<a href="https://appfigures.com/resources/press/privacy-isnt-a-luxury">heir statement read.</a></p>

<li><strong>The Epic Games/Apple lawsuit will drag on.</strong> After last week&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">ruling</a>, which will now allow developers to add to iOS apps links to their website and other ways to pay, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Epic said it would appeal</a>. The Fortnite maker wanted Apple to be dubbed a monopolist, which would force iOS to be opened up to alternative app stores, like its own, or at least allow side-loading. But the judge said Apple&#8217;s success was &#8220;not illegal.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Developers were <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">invited to submit</a> their iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15 and watchOS 8 apps to the App Store</strong>, ahead of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">public launch</a> on Monday.</li>
<li><strong>Apple introduced new marketing<a href="https://tools.applemediaservices.com/apple-app-store-promote"> tools</a> for app developers.</strong> Developers can now create custom marketing assets, including banners and images, to promote apps across social media and elsewhere. To get started, you select an app and a template, then customize the design and add present messages. The assets will be immediately available in the right sizes and can be shared with short links or codes that direct users to the App Store product page.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If ever there was a time when working at the Securities and Exchange Commission was a dull affair, that&#8217;s no longer true. The federal agency that&#8217;s responsible for protecting investors and maintaining fair and orderly functioning of our securities markets is busier than ever, thanks to the rise of SPACs, cryptocurrencies and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/sec-startups-crowdfunding">new rules</a> around how startups raise money. And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>In just a few of its many cases, it this week charged App Annie, the mobile data and analytics firm, as well as its co-founder and former CEO and Chairman Bertrand Schmitt, with securities fraud.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gcMM2fyfZJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">App Annie and co-founder charged with securities fraud, will pay $10M+ settlement</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;App Annie and co-founder charged with securities fraud, will pay $10M+ settlement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/embed/#?secret=gcMM2fyfZJ" data-secret="gcMM2fyfZJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The charges come hot on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/the-sec-and-the-doj-just-charged-this-startup-ceo-with-fraud-saying-he-lied-to-tiger-and-others/">another case</a> that the SEC announced late last month against Manish Lachwani, the former CEO of Silicon Valley startup HeadSpin, who has been accused of defrauding investors out of $80 million by falsely claiming HeadSpin had achieved stronger and more consistent growth on the customer and revenue front than was the case.</p>
<p>It also still has an active case against former Theranos president &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Balwani, who, unlike Theranos and its founder Elizabeth Holmes, has refused to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-theranos-sec/theranos-and-its-founder-settle-u-s-fraud-charges-sec-idUSKCN1GQ2HC">settle with the agency</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, in the midst of its active fieldwork, it&#8217;s getting used to grappling &#8212; publicly &#8212; with powerful tech CEOs. It famously became a target of Elon Musk several years ago when it filed securities fraud charges against him tied to his social media activities. (It <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-failed-to-oversee-elon-musk-s-tweets-sec-argued-in-letters-11622582765?mod=djemalertNEWS">continues to try</a> reining in the tweets of Musk, who has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-tweet-appears-to-mock-the-securities-and-exchange-commission-1538685320?mod=article_inline">openly mocked</a> the agency.)</p>
<p>More recently, it found itself the target of a <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1435439291715358721?lang=en">Twitter tirade</a> by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1JexKPRV0M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/canva-ceo-melanie-perkins-will-tell-us-about-the-journey-to-a-15b-valuation-at-disrupt/">Canva CEO Melanie Perkins will tell us about the journey to a $15B valuation at Disrupt</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canva CEO Melanie Perkins will tell us about the journey to a $15B valuation at Disrupt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/canva-ceo-melanie-perkins-will-tell-us-about-the-journey-to-a-15b-valuation-at-disrupt/embed/#?secret=1JexKPRV0M" data-secret="1JexKPRV0M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Leading the charge in each of these cases and many more is Erin Schneider, who attended UC Berkeley as an undergraduate and law student and who, after a brief stint as a staff accountant at PWC and as a lawyer with a global law office, headed to the SEC as a staff attorney. She has steadily worked her way up since, and in May 2019 was appointed as the head of its San Francisco office, which leads enforcement and examinations in not only Northern California but also the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Because she and her colleagues have their hands particularly full, you can imagine how excited we are that Schneider is coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt (September 21-23)</a> to discuss some of the agency&#8217;s many current challenges &#8212; as well as its victories.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning more about the SEC’s ever-evolving approach to Silicon Valley startups, and why you shouldn’t expect its interest to dissipate any time soon, you really won’t want to miss this conversation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt</a> is coming up fast. Don&#8217;t miss our conversation with Schneider or with Brian Armstrong himself, or actor-entrepreneur <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/ryan-reynolds-is-coming-to-disrupt/">Ryan Reynolds</a>, or investor Chamath Palihapitiya, or the many other powerful speakers who will be gracing our virtual stage this year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Get your ticket now</a> for less than $100 &#8212; and we’ll see you soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Thank you for clicking on this email. With a subject line like <em>that</em> you are legend for being here.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re talking buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) companies today, a particular part of the larger fintech world that is more than interesting.</p>
<p>Thanks to recent mega-buys of players in the BNPL space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">from Square</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/">and PayPal</a>, we’ve been getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/heres-what-your-bnpl-startup-could-be-worth/">closer to understanding</a> just what the value of the companies in the space may really be &#8212; and for the myriad BNPL startups in the market, it’s big news.</p>
<p>But while I was on vacation (<a href="https://twitter.com/selviano/status/1438907529564602368">Michael’s fault, it turns out</a>), Goldman Sachs decided to buy GreenSky, a public BNPL company. Which means that we can quickly run some numbers on the deal and add this latest arrow to our How To Value A BNPL Company quiver.</p>
<p>My friend and colleague &#8212; and former deskmate, back in the day &#8212; Ryan Lawler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/goldman-greensky-bnpl/">has an interview with Goldman that is worth reading</a>. The transaction is worth $2.24 billion, per Goldman, driving the value of GreekSky dramatically higher in its aftermath, as investors digested the implied deal premium to the company’s previous share price.</p>
<p>What sort of volume was GreenSky’s home-improvement-focused BNPL doing? Here’s the company’s <a href="https://investors.greensky.com/news-releases/news-release-details/greensky-inc-reports-record-net-income-and-adjusted-ebitda">latest earnings report</a>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Transaction Volume: Second quarter transaction volume was $1.5 billion, an increase of 14% when compared to the second quarter of 2020. Approved credit lines for the quarter were the highest in Company history and are a positive leading indicator of momentum as home improvement supply chain and labor market shortages ease.</p></blockquote>
<p>So a $6 billion run-rate at a price of $2.24 billion. That works out to about $0.37 in corporate value for each dollar in GMV that GreenSky handles. Which is the <em>lowest</em> number we’ve seen to date.</p>
<p>As a reminder, here’s what we’ve found more recently, with both of us keeping in mind that not every figure below is perfectly apples:apples; these are directional figures more than absolutes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affirm: </strong>$2.94 in value per dollar of serviced GMV</li>
<li><strong>AfterPay: </strong>$1.84 per dollar of serviced GMV (at Square price)</li>
<li><strong>Paidy: </strong>$1.80 per dollar of serviced GMV (at PayPal price)</li>
<li><strong>Klarna:</strong> $0.57 per dollar of serviced GMV</li>
</ul>
<p>GreenSky sits at the bottom of the list. Perhaps growth is the reason? A 14% GMV growth rate doesn’t give the company much leeway to grow, even if it manages a higher take rate. It’s hard to burnish a growth rate that starts with a <em>one</em>, especially if the leading line atop your investor relations page is “GREENSKY, INC. IS A GROWTH COMPANY.”</p>
<p>Akin to how we’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/the-value-of-software-revenue-may-have-finally-stopped-rising/">seen diverging SaaS revenue multiples</a>, striated along the axes of revenue growth and revenue quality, there’s likely something similar afoot here. Loss ratios, take rates, and GMV growth are vectors by which BNPL companies will be valued differently.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UhC5JLsZFt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/the-value-of-software-revenue-may-have-finally-stopped-rising/">The value of software revenue may have finally stopped rising</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The value of software revenue may have finally stopped rising&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/the-value-of-software-revenue-may-have-finally-stopped-rising/embed/#?secret=UhC5JLsZFt" data-secret="UhC5JLsZFt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>BNPL <em>startups</em> can find their most accurate comp in growth and loan quality terms, and then work backwards to their present-day market worth. It’s good to have data.</p>
<h2>Mammoths?</h2>
<p>I was going to spend the bulk of this newsletter discussing Mammoth Biosciences, and its plan to Jurassic Park the world, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/breakout-crispr-platform-company-mammoth-biosciences-is-officially-a-unicorn/">but TechCrunch beat me to it</a>. I spoke to one of its investors &#8212; Thomas Tull &#8212; about the deal, but will hold onto those notes for a bit. I suspect we’ll need them in time.</p>
<h2>One neat funding round to close us out</h2>
<p>Disrupt is next week, and with an IPO cycle upon us I’ve fallen behind my usual funding round cadence. (And comms, sorry!) So, here’s a makeup entry for our shared enjoyment: <a href="https://postal.io/">Postal</a>.</p>
<p>The company works in the marketing tech space, operating what its website claims is the “largest” business-to-business “gifting marketplace.” More simply, it helps companies send personalized <em>physical</em> goods to customers. Which it claims has a very high ROI.</p>
<p>In a somewhat ironic twist, I actually have to do some disclosures at this juncture. It turns out the company’s leading investors are Mayfield and OMERS. Those two firms led my <a href="http://crunchbase.com">former employer’s</a> Series B and C rounds, respectively. But if I didn’t write about companies to which my Crunchbase connection didn’t cause some sort of awkward frisson, I’d have to cut out too large a swath of the market. I’ll just keep bringing up the matter when we have to.</p>
<p>Postal works in a somewhat similar space to Sendoso, though, to my understanding, the latter company deals a bit more with employee gifting over customer-focused efforts. In time they’ll compete directly if they both keep growing. Sendoso <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/sendoso-nabs-100m-as-its-corporate-gifting-platform-passes-20000-customers/">raised $100 million earlier this week</a>, because of course it did.</p>
<p>Other players in the space include Reachdesk and Alyce (which raised $30 million earlier this year), among others. The business of building tech to deliver personalized physical goods is pretty big, it turns out. (You can make an NFT joke here, if you’d like.)</p>
<p>PitchBook pegs Sendoso’s new valuation at $640 million (post-money) and Alyce at $135 million (post-money). Present-day valuations for Reachdesk and Postal.io were not available.</p>
<p>Okay that is enough for now. Have a delightful weekend, and I’ll see you at Disrupt! You may see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true&amp;promo=Wilhelm20">a <em>lot</em> of me</a> on the Extra Crunch stage. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank has been on a tear in Latin America. The Japanese investment conglomerate just announced it has launched its second Latin America-focused fund with a $3 billion capital commitment from the company that may grow as the fund explores &#8220;options to raise additional capital,&#8221; according to SoftBank. The vehicle follows hot on the heels of SoftBank&#8217;s debut Latin America-focused fund, announced in March 2019 with an initial $2 billion in committed capital.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to see what all the fuss is about. Led by Marcelo Claure, CEO of SoftBank Group International and COO of SoftBank Group Corp., the outfit&#8217;s roughly four dozen employees &#8212; who operate out of Miami, São Paulo and Mexico City &#8212; have helped SoftBank identify and fund 48 startups into which it has plugged $3.5 billion and, according to the firm, which feature a combined (on paper, notably) net IRR of 85%.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s so busy that it just brought aboard <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210916005429/en/SoftBank-Adds-New-Managing-Partners-to-Latin-America-Funds%E2%80%99-Investment-Team-to-Focus-on-Early-stage-Companies">two new managing partners</a> at the end of last week to help out with all that investing.</p>
<p>Amazingly, overseeing investments in Latin America is just one of the many roles that Claure, a native of Bolivia, plays for SoftBank. (He also oversees a vast portfolio of SoftBank&#8217;s operating companies, including Arm, Brightstar, Fortress, SB Energy and Boston Dynamics; he oversees SoftBank’s ownership in T-Mobile US; and he serves as executive chairman of WeWork, which he ran as interim CEO after founder Adam Neumann was forced to resign.) Still, one senses that it may be his greatest passion right now, and we&#8217;re thrilled to say that he&#8217;ll be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt</a> on the morning of Thursday, September 23rd, to talk all about it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>This week, China gets serious about breaking down the walled gardens that its internet giants have formed for decades. Two major funding rounds were announced, from the newly established autonomous driving unicorn Deeproute.ai and fast-growing, cross-border financial service provider XTransfer.</p>
<h2>Tear down the walls</h2>
<p>The Chinese internet is infamously siloed, with a handful of &#8220;super apps&#8221; each occupying a cushy, protective territory that tries to lock users in and keep rivals out. On Tencent&#8217;s WeChat messenger, for instance, links to Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao marketplace and ByteDance&#8217;s Douyin short video service can&#8217;t be viewed or even redirected. That&#8217;s unlike WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal that offer friendly URL previews within chats.</p>
<p>E-commerce platforms fend off competition in different ways. Taobao uses Alibaba&#8217;s affiliate Alipay as a default payments option, omitting its arch rival WeChat Pay. Tencent-backed JD.com, a rival to Alibaba, encourages its users to pay through its own payments system or WeChat Pay.</p>
<p>But changes are underway. &#8220;Ensuring normal access to legal URLs is the basic requirement for developing the internet,&#8221; a senior official from China&#8217;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology <a href="http://news.china.com.cn/2021-09/13/content_77749682.htm">said</a> at a press conference this week. He added that unjustified blockages of web links &#8220;affect users&#8217; experience, undermine users&#8217; rights, and disrupt market orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is some merit in filtering third-party links when it comes to keeping out the likes of pornography, misinformation and violent content. Content distributors in China also strictly abide by censorship rules, silencing politically sensitive discussions. These principles will stay in place, and MIIT&#8217;s new order is really to crack anticompetitive practices and wane the power of the bloated internet giants.</p>
<p>The call to end digital walled gardens is part of MIIT&#8217;s campaign, started <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2021-07/26/c_1127695852.htm">in July</a>, to restore &#8220;orders&#8221; to the Chinese internet. While crackdowns on internet firms are routine, the spate of new policies announced in recent months &#8212; from new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/">data security rules</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/11/china-roundup-tencent-takes-on-sites-trying-to-circumvent-its-age-limits/">heightened gaming restrictions</a> &#8212; signify Beijing&#8217;s resolution to curb the influence of Chinese internet firms of all kinds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deadline for online platforms to unblock URLs is September 17, the MIIT <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2021-09-13/doc-iktzqtyt5796838.shtml">said</a> earlier. Virtually all the major internet companies have swiftly issued statements saying they will firmly carry out MIIT&#8217;s requirements and help promote the healthy development of the Chinese internet.</p>
<p>Internet users are bound to benefit from the dismantling of the walled gardens. They will be able to browse third-party content smoothly on WeChat without having to switch between apps. They can share product links from Taobao right within the messenger instead of having their friends copy-paste a string of cryptic codes that Taobao automatically generates for WeChat sharing.</p>
<h2>Robotaxi dream</h2>
<p>Autonomous driving startup Deeproute.ai said this week it has closed a $300 million Series B round from investors including Alibaba, Jeneration Capital, and Chinese automaker Geely. The valuation of this round was undisclosed.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a lot of publicity from Pony.ai, WeRide, Momenta and AutoX but not so much Deeproute.ai. That in part is because the company is relatively young, founded only in 2019 by Zhou Guang after he was &#8220;fired&#8221; by his co-founders at the once-promising <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/roadstar-ai/company_financials">Roadstar.ai</a> amid company infighting.</p>
<p>Investors in Roadstar.ai <a href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/roadstar-ai-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-self-driving-startup-2b45f1ddcbcf">reportedly</a> saw the dismissal of Zhou as detrimental to the startup, which had raised at least $140 million up to that point, and subsequently sought to dissolve the business. It appears that Zhou, formerly the chief scientist at Roadstar, still commands the trust of some investors to support his reborn autonomous driving venture.</p>
<p>Like Pony.ai and WeRide, Deeproute is trying to operate its own robotaxi fleets. While the business model gives it control over reams of driving data, it&#8217;s research- and cash-intensive. As such, major Chinese robotaxi startups are all looking at faster commercial deployments, like self-driving buses and trucks, to ease their financial stress.</p>
<h2>Cross-border trade boom</h2>
<p>The other major funding news this week comes from Shanghai-based XTransfer, which helps small-and-medium Chinese exporters collect payments from overseas. The Series C round, led by D1 Partners, pulled in $138 million and catapulted Xtransfer&#8217;s valuation to over $1 billion. The proceeds will go towards product development, hiring and global expansion.</p>
<p>Founded by former executives from Ant Group, XTransfer tries to solve a pain point faced by small and medium exporters: opening and maintaining bank accounts in different countries can be difficult and costly. As such, XTransfer works as a payments gateway between its SME customer, the party that pays it, and their respective banks.</p>
<p>As of July, XTransfer&#8217;s customers had surpassed 150,000, most of which are in mainland China. The company of over 1,000 employees is also expanding into Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>While business-to-business export is booming in China, more and more products are also being directly sold from Chinese brands to consumers around the world. Some of the most successful examples, like Shein and Anker, use a different set of payments processors for their direct-to-consumer sales, which tend to be in bigger volume but smaller in average ticket value.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The venture capital industry as we know it is broken. At least for women, that is.</p>
<p>In terms of funding to women founders, 2020 was among the worst years on record. On a global level, only 9% of all funds deployed to technology startups went to founding teams that included at least one woman. Solo woman founders and all-women teams raised just 2% of all VC dollars, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/">Crunchbase data showed</a>.</p>
<p>Shockingly, this number is actually<em> less</em> than it was when we first started counting a decade ago, well before many high-profile diversity initiatives launched with the goal of fixing this very problem.</p>
<p>This funding gap isn’t just a moral crisis &#8212; it’s an economic one. The lack of investment into women-founded startups is a <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/the-trillion-dollar-opportunity-in-supporting-female-entrepreneurs">missed opportunity</a> worth trillions of dollars. That’s because of <a href="https://www.allraise.org/assets/pitchbook_all_raise_2019_all_in_women_in_the_vc_ecosystem.pdf">overwhelming evidence</a> that startups founded by women outperform startups founded by men: They generate more revenue, earn higher profits and exit faster at higher valuations. And they do all this while raising <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ruthumoh/2020/08/19/female-founders-face-funding-hurdles-and-report-less-runway-amid-pandemic/">way less money</a>.</p>
<p>What we’re doing isn’t working. Through research for my next book on women founders and funders, I kept asking myself the same question: When it comes to fixing the funding gap for women founders, what’s the one thing we can do that will make everything else easier or unnecessary?</p>
<p>I now believe that our best bet for long-term change is to focus our efforts on increasing the number of women investing partners who can write large seed checks. Here’s why.</p>
<h2>Women investors are up to 3x more likely to fund women founders</h2>
<p>Recently, one of the top VCs in the world told me how challenging it is to diversify his senior team. He expressed it as an accepted fact and a widespread belief. This is a common trope in Silicon Valley: Everyone <em>wants</em> gender diversity, but it’s so hard to find all the senior women!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the venture capital industry, who you hire at the senior level is who you hang out with. And who you hire at the senior level determines who your fund will back.</p>
<p>Since studies now show that women investors are up to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/committeeof200/2020/09/22/diversity-as-uperpower-the-well-known-data-against-homogeneous-teams-in-venture-capital/?sh=61de50322019">three times more likely</a> to invest in women founders, it is clear that the fastest way to fund more women is to hire more women investing partners with check-writing ability. The effect to venture firms? Returns.</p>
<p>“When U.S. VC firms increased the proportion of female partners, they benefited with 9.7% more profitable exits and a 1.5% spike in overall fund returns annually,” explained <a href="https://www.wrg.vc/news-posts/2020/12/8/diversity-as-uperpower-the-well-known-data-against-homogeneous-teams-in-venture-capital">Lisa Stone</a> of WestRiver Group.</p>
<p><a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/2019-pitchbook-all-raise-all-in-women-in-the-vc-ecosystem">Data from All Raise and PitchBook</a> reinforce the “correlation between hiring female decision-makers at the investment level and outperformance at the fund level,” adding that “69.2% of U.S. VCs that scored a top-quartile fund between 2009 and 2018 had women in decision-making roles.”</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be surprising that women investors are more likely to invest in women founders. That’s because humans have a propensity toward <a href="https://twitter.com/Claire/status/1435990441330155520">homophily</a><strong> &#8212;</strong> the tendency for like to attract like and for similarity to breed connection.</p>
<p>Homophily is why a vegan VC is more likely to invest in a vegan food tech, a gamer is more likely to hang out with gaming founders, or a parent is more likely to invest in a parent marketplace. People gravitate toward <a href="https://clairediazortiz.com/why-women-invest-in-women-homophily/">what they know</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/deenashakir">Deena Shakir</a>, who happens to be a woman and a mother, recently led Lux Capital’s investment into women’s health unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/mavens-comprehensive-approach-to-womens-health-earns-it-unicorn-status/">Maven</a>. Shakir had multiple high-risk pregnancies with multiple complications, emergency C-sections, NICU stays and breastfeeding challenges.</p>
<p>“It is no coincidence that I am joined on Maven’s board of directors by four other mothers … and a brand-new father … whose personal journeys have also informed their professional conviction,” Shakir wrote in a <a href="https://medium.com/lux-capital/our-investment-in-maven-clinic-a-milestone-for-maternal-and-family-health-224b1bea5d60">Medium post</a>.</p>
<h2>Why seed checks have the greatest impact on the ecosystem</h2>
<p>I believe that to fix the funding gap for women founders and jump-start the virtuous cycle of venture capital investing into women, we should focus on getting more seed checks into the hands of women founders. That’s because <a href="https://hbr.org/podcast/2021/05/understanding-the-venture-capital-gender-gap">seed investing is a leading indicator</a> of whether we are headed in the right direction in terms of closing the funding gap for women, according to <a href="https://freestyle.vc/team-jenny-lefcourt/">Jenny Lefcourt</a>, a partner at Freestyle and co-founder of <a href="https://www.allraise.org/">All Raise</a>, the leading nonprofit focused on diversifying the VC industry.</p>
<p>This doesn’t discount the importance of investments made into women founders at later stages. When a women founder lands Series D capital, it boosts this year’s numbers into women founders and likely brings that particular founder closer to a liquidity event that will lead her (and her executives) to invest in more women.</p>
<p>That said, the greatest impact on the future ecosystem will come from widening the top of the funnel and giving more women at the seed stage the shot to one day reach a momentous Series D funding like Maven. After all, who we fund now becomes who we fund later.</p>
<h2>Why large seed checks matter most</h2>
<p>Finally, the size of the check is also important when thinking about how to have the biggest impact on the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I know first-hand that <a href="https://twitter.com/Claire/status/1397954144644780032">microchecks are critical</a> to building an inclusive ecosystem. When women invest at the seed level — in any amount — they jumpstart a virtuous cycle of women funding women. That’s why when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vc-claire-diaz-ortiz-parental-leave-silicon-valley-pregnant-founders-2021-6">I stepped in to lend a hand at my portfolio company</a> when the solo woman founder took a parental leave, one of my key projects was to develop Jefa House, a way for Jefa’s own executives to easily invest in other women-founded startups.</p>
<p>That said, large party rounds made up entirely of small angel checks are few and far between. Similar challenges face small checks from emerging fund managers. Although the sheer number of emerging managers has <a href="https://www.kauffmanfellows.org/journal_posts/a-new-platform-for-emerging-managers">increased 9x in seven years</a>, the reality is that most emerging managers simply don’t have much money.</p>
<p>Are women venture capitalists who run their own microfunds more likely to invest in amazing women founders than Tier 1 funds with few or no women investing partners? Yes. Will it take them a long time to compete with those Tier 1 funds in terms of check size? Yes.</p>
<p>This is why it matters so much when leading funds hire or promote women to the partner level. Not only does it give women founders a better shot at funding from high-signal shops, but the moves that top funds make are key signals to others in the ecosystem: In venture capital, women investors don’t have to sit at the kids’ table.</p>
<h2>Why we must hire women investing partners</h2>
<p>We all know that great returns in early-stage venture capital come from making big bets on great ideas that others aren’t betting on. That is why <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2021/06/18/contrarian-investment-techniques-in-venture-capital-part-1/?sh=5b6d4b1d5d2c">VC investing is contrarian by definition</a>. Thanks to our increasingly globalized world and clear data showing the importance of diverse teams to make good decisions to get those returns, no one in 2021 truly believes that single white dudes in Palo Alto have a monopoly on billion-dollar ideas.</p>
<p>However, due to the nature of homophily, venture capital remains a highly homogenous industry, and the social and economic interactions and decisions of human beings remain deeply swayed by these principles. No matter how much work we do, birds of a feather really do flock — and fund — together.</p>
<p>This all leads to one place: The clearest path to funding different kinds of founders with different kinds of ideas is to put different kinds of investors on the investing side of the table. To get more funding to women founders, we need more women who can write checks. That’s why prioritizing the hiring of women investing partners who can write large seed checks is key to fixing the funding crisis for women founders and increasing VC returns worldwide.</p>
