										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the upcoming release of<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/"> iOS 15</a> for Apple mobile devices, Apple&#8217;s built-in search feature known as Spotlight will become a lot more functional. In what may be one of its bigger updates since it <a href="https://tidbits.com/2015/09/16/explaining-siri-suggestions-and-spotlight-search-in-ios-9/">introduced</a> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210658">Siri Suggestions</a>, the new version of Spotlight is becoming an alternative to Google for several key queries, including web images and information about actors, musicians, TV shows and movies. It will also now be able to search across your photo library, deliver richer results for contacts, and connect you more directly with apps and the information they contain. It even allows you to install apps from the App Store without leaving Spotlight itself.</p>
<p>Spotlight is also more accessible than ever before.</p>
<p>Years ago, Spotlight moved from its location to the left of the Home screen to become available with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/18/a-few-tricks-all-the-new-ios-7-users-should-know/">swipe down in the middle of any screen</a> in iOS 7, which helped grow user adoption. Now, it&#8217;s available with the same swipe down gesture on the iPhone&#8217;s Lock Screen, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can access spotlight from the lock screen <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS15?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iOS15</a> (locked or unlocked) <a href="https://t.co/rVC1DqvBkA">pic.twitter.com/rVC1DqvBkA</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Alex Fife (@alextfife) <a href="https://twitter.com/alextfife/status/1402682130979823616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple showed off a few of Spotlight&#8217;s improvements during its keynote address at its Worldwide Developer Conference, including the search feature&#8217;s new cards for looking up information on actors, movies and shows, as well as musicians. This change alone could redirect a good portion of web searches away from Google or dedicated apps like IMDb.</p>
<p>For years, Google has been offering quick access to common searches through its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Knowledge_Graph">Knowledge Graph</a>, a knowledge base that allows it to gather information from across sources and then use that to add informational panels above and the side of its standard search results. Panels on actors, musicians, shows and movies are available as part of that effort.</p>
<p>But now, iPhone users can just pull up this info on their home screen.</p>
<p>The new cards include more than the typical Wikipedia bio and background information you may expect &#8212; they also showcase links to where you can listen or watch content from the artist or actor or movie or show in question. They include news articles, social media links, official websites, and even direct you to where the searched person or topic may be found inside your own apps. (E.g. a search for &#8220;Billie Eilish&#8221; may direct you to her tour tickets inside SeatGeek, or a podcast where she&#8217;s a guest).</p>

<p>For web image searches, Spotlight also now allows you to search for people, places, animals, and more from the web &#8212; eating into another search vertical Google today provides.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164070" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164070" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="571" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?resize=150,126 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?resize=300,252 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?resize=768,645 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?resize=680,571 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164070" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> iOS 15 screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Your personal searches have been upgraded with richer results, too, in iOS 15.</p>
<p>When you search for a contact, you&#8217;ll be taken to a card that does more than show their name and how to reach them. You&#8217;ll also see their current status (thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-refines-ios-15-notifications-with-focus-summary-features/">another iOS 15 feature</a>), as well as their location from FindMy, your recent conversations on Messages, your shared photos, calendar appointments, emails, notes, and files. It&#8217;s almost like a personal CRM system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164045" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164045" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164045" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg 3354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=1536,858 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1144 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164045" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Personal photo searches have also been improved. Spotlight now uses Siri intelligence to allow you to search your photos by the people, scenes, elements in your photos, as well as by location. And it&#8217;s able to leverage the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-live-text-lets-you-interact-with-text-in-your-photos/">new Live Text feature in iOS 15</a> to find the text in your photos to return relevant results.</p>
<p>This could make it easier to pull up photos where you&#8217;ve screenshot a recipe, a store receipt, or even a handwritten note, Apple said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164046" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164046" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164046" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="381" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg 3330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=1536,860 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1146 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164046" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>A couple of features related to Spotlight&#8217;s integration with apps weren&#8217;t mentioned during the keynote.</p>
<p>Spotlight will now display action buttons on the Maps results for businesses that will prompt users to engage with that business&#8217;s app. In this case, the feature is leveraging <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/">App Clips</a>, which are small parts of a developer&#8217;s app that let you quickly perform a task even without downloading or installing the app in question. For example, from Spotlight you may be prompted to pull up a restaurant&#8217;s menu, buy tickets, make an appointment, order takeout, join a waitlist, see showtimes, pay for parking, check prices and more.</p>
<p>The feature will require the business to support App Clips in order to work.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164054" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164054" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2164054" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164054" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> iOS 15 screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Another under-the-radar change &#8212; but a significant one &#8212; is the new ability to install apps from the App Store directly from Spotlight.</p>
<p>This could prompt more app installs, as it reduces the steps from a search to a download, and makes querying the App Store more broadly available across the operating system.</p>
<p>Developers can additionally choose to insert a few lines of code to their app to make data from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10098/">app discoverable within Spotlight</a> and customize how it&#8217;s presented to users. This means Spotlight can work as a tool for searching content from inside apps &#8212; another way Apple is redirecting users away from traditional web searches in favor of apps.</p>
<p>However, unlike Google&#8217;s search engine, which relies on crawlers that browse the web to index the data it contains, Spotlight&#8217;s in-app search requires developer adoption.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s clear Apple sees Spotlight as a potential rival to web search engines, including Google&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spotlight is the universal place to start <em>all</em> your searches,&#8221; said Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi during the keynote event.</p>
<p>Spotlight, of course, can&#8217;t handle &#8220;all&#8221; your searches just yet, but it appears to be steadily working towards that goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Machine learning models have already mastered Chess, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/24/alphago-beats-planets-best-human-go-player-ke-jie/">Go</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/deepminds-agent57-ai-agent-can-best-human-players-across-a-suite-of-57-atari-games/">Atari games</a> and more, but in order for it to ascend to the next level, researchers at Facebook intend for AI to <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/launching-the-nethack-challenge-at-neurips-2021/">take on a different kind of game</a>: the notoriously difficult and infinitely complex NetHack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to construct what we think is <a href="https://nethackchallenge.com/">the most accessible &#8216;grand challenge&#8217;</a> with this game. It won&#8217;t <em>solve</em> AI, but it will unlock pathways towards <em>better</em> AI,&#8221; said Facebook AI Research&#8217;s Edward Grefenstette. &#8220;Games are a good domain to find our assumptions about what makes machines intelligent and break them.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may not be familiar with NetHack, but it&#8217;s one of the most influential games of all time. You&#8217;re an adventurer in a fantasy world, delving through the increasingly dangerous depths of a dungeon that&#8217;s different every time. You must battle monsters, navigate traps and other hazards, and meanwhile stay on good terms with your god. It&#8217;s the first &#8220;roguelike&#8221; (after Rogue, its immediate and much simpler predecessor) and arguably still the best — almost certainly the hardest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(It&#8217;s free, by the way, and you can <a href="http://nethack.org/">download and play it on nearly any platform.</a>)</p>
<p>Its simple ASCII graphics, using a g for a goblin, an @ for the player, lines and dots for the level&#8217;s architecture, and so on, belie its incredible complexity. Because Nethack, which made its debut in 1987, has been under active development ever since, with its shifting team of developers expanding its roster of objects and creatures, rules, and the countless, countless interactions between them all.</p>
<p>And this is part of what makes NetHack such a difficult and interesting challenge for AI: It&#8217;s so open-ended. Not only is the world different every time, but every object and creature can interact in new ways, most of them hand-coded over decades to cover every possible player choice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Atari, Dota 2, StarCraft 2&#8230; the solutions we&#8217;ve had to make progress there are very interesting. NetHack just presents different challenges. You have to rely on human knowledge to play the game as a human,&#8221; said Grefenstette.</p>
<p>In these other games, there&#8217;s a more or less obvious strategy to winning. Of course it&#8217;s more complex in a game like Dota 2 than in an Atari 800 game, but the idea is the same — there are pieces the player controls, a game board of environment, and win conditions to pursue. That&#8217;s kind of the case in NetHack, but it&#8217;s weirder than that. For one thing, the game is different every time, and not just in the details.</p>
<p>&#8220;New dungeon, new world, new monsters and items, you don&#8217;t have a save point. If you make a mistake and die you don&#8217;t get a second shot. It&#8217;s a bit like real life,&#8221; said Grefenstette. &#8220;You have to learn from mistakes and come to new situations armed with that knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drinking a corrosive potion is a bad idea, of course, but what about throwing it at a monster? Coating your weapon with it? Pouring it on the lock of a treasure chest? Diluting it with water? We have intuitive ideas about these actions, but a game-playing AI doesn&#8217;t think the way we do.</p>
<p>The depth and complexity of the systems in NetHack are difficult to explain, but that diversity and difficulty make the game a perfect candidate for a competition, according to Grefenstette. &#8220;You have to rely on human knowledge to play the game,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>People have been designing bots to play NetHack for many years that rely not on neural networks but decision trees as complex as the game itself. The team at Facebook Research hopes to engender a new approach by building a training environment that people can test machine learning-based game-playing algorithms on.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/nle">NetHack Learning Environment</a> was actually put together last year, but the NetHack Challenge is only just now getting started. The NLE is basically a version of the game embedded in a dedicated computing environment that lets an AI interact with it through text commands (directions, actions like attack or quaff)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tempting target for ambitious AI designers. While games like StarCraft 2 may enjoy a higher profile in some ways, NetHack is legendary and the idea of building a model on completely different lines from those used to dominate other games is an interesting challenge.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also, as Grefenstette explained, a more accessible one than many in the past. If you wanted to build an AI for StarCraft 2, you needed a lot of computing power available to run visual recognition engines on the imagery from the game. But in this case the entire game is transmitted via text, making it extremely efficient to work with. It can be played thousands of times faster than any human could with even the most basic computing setup. That leaves the challenge wide open to individuals and groups who don&#8217;t have access to the kind of high-power setups necessary to power other machine learning methods.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to create a research environment that had a lot of challenges for the AI community, but not restrict it to only large academic labs,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For the next few months, NLE will be available for people to test on, and competitors can basically build their bot or AI by whatever means they choose. But when the competition itself starts in earnest on October 15, they&#8217;ll be limited to interacting with the game in its controlled environment through standard commands — no special access, no inspecting RAM, etc.</p>
<p>The goal of the competition will be to complete the game, and the Facebook team will track how many times the agent &#8220;ascends,&#8221; as it&#8217;s called in NetHack, in a set amount of time. But &#8220;we&#8217;re assuming this is going to be zero for everyone,&#8221; Grefenstette admitted. After all, this is one of the hardest games ever made, and even humans who have played it for years have trouble winning even once in a lifetime, let alone several times in a row. There will be other scoring metrics to judge winners in a number of categories.</p>
<p>The hope is that this challenge provides the seed of a new approach to AI, one that more fundamentally resembles actual human thinking. Shortcuts, trial and error, score-hacking, and zerging won&#8217;t work here — the agent needs to learn systems of logic and apply them flexibly and intelligently, or die horribly at the hands of an enraged centaur or owlbear.</p>
<p>You can check out the rules and other <a href="https://nethackchallenge.com/">specifics of the NetHack Challenge here</a>. Results will be announced at the NeurIPS conference later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After making investments in 57 startups together, Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra and Eventjoy founder Todd Goldberg are back at it with a new $24 million fund and big ambitions amid a venture capital renaissance with fast-moving deals a plenty.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.toddandrahulangelfund.com/">Todd and Rahul&#8217;s Angel Fund</a>&#8221; announced their first $7.3 million fund just weeks before the pandemic hit stateside last year and they were soon left with more access to deals than they had funding to support; they went on raise $3.5 million in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/angellist-pioneers-rolling-vc-funds-in-pivot-to-saas/">rolling fund</a> designed around making investments in later stage deals beyond Seed and Series A rounds.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We closed right before Covid hit and we had one plan but then everything accelerated,&#8221; Goldberg tells TechCrunch. &#8220;A lot of our companies started raising additional rounds.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With their latest raise, Vohra and Goldberg are looking to maintain their wide outlook with a single fund, saying they plan to invest three-quarters of the fund in early stage deals while saving a quarter of the $24 million for later stage opportunities. Still, the duo know they likely could&#8217;ve chosen to raise more.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of our peers were scaling up into much larger funds,&#8221; Vohra says. &#8220;For us, we wanted to stay small and collaborative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the firm&#8217;s investments from their first fund include NBA Top Shot creator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/nba-top-shot-maker-dapper-labs-is-now-worth-2-6-billion-thanks-to-half-of-hollywood-the-nba-and-michael-jordan/">Dapper Labs</a>, open source Firebase alternative <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/supabase-raises-6m-for-its-open-source-firebase-alternative/">Supabase</a>, D2C liquor brand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/haus-raises-4-5-million-to-replace-your-wine-club-membership/">Haus</a>, alternative asset platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sports-trading-card-platform-alt-launches-with-31-million-in-funding-and-plenty-of-market-hype/">Alt</a>, biowearable maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/levels-raises-12m-from-a16z-and-others-to-bring-its-biowearable-to-market/">Levels</a> and location analytics startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/location-data-analytics-startup-placer-ai-raises-50m-series-b/">Placer</a>. Their biggest hit was an early investment in audio chat app Clubhouse before Andreessen Horowitz led its buzzy seed round at a $100 million valuation. Clubhouse most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">raised at $4 billion</a>.</p>

<p>The pair say they&#8217;ve learned a ton through the past year of navigating increasingly competitive rounds and that fighting for those deals has helped the duo hone how they market themselves to founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never want to be a passive check,&#8221; Goldberg says. &#8220;We do three things: help companies find product/market fit, we help them super-charge distribution.. and we help them find the best investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>A big part of the firm&#8217;s appeal to founders has been the &#8220;operator&#8221; status of its founders. Goldberg&#8217;s startup Eventjoy was acquired by Ticketmaster and Vohra&#8217;s Rapportive was bought by Linkedin while his current startup Superhuman has maintained buzz for its premium email service and has raised $33 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and First Round Capital.</p>
<p>Their new has an unusual LP base that&#8217;s made up of over 110 entrepreneurs and investors, including 40 founders that Vohra and Goldberg have previously backed themselves. Backers of their second fund include Plaid&#8217;s William Hockey, Behance&#8217;s Scott Belsky, Haus&#8217;s Helena Price Hambrecht, Lattice&#8217;s Jack Altman and Loom&#8217;s Shahed Khan.</p>

			The logistics of setting up a startup should be simple, because over the long run, complicated equity setups and cap tables cost more money in legal fees and administration time.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>My company, Pulley, has helped more than a thousand founders build their cap table and equity structure.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a tactical guide to get your startup running in just four days.</p>
<h2>Day 1: Incorporate</h2>
<p>It is now standard to incorporate your company at the seed stage itself. In the U.S., startups incorporate as Delaware C Corporations with 10 million authorized shares. This is the standard setup when you use services like Stripe Atlas or Clerky.</p>
<p>Post incorporation, you need to answer a few questions on how to grant equity to founders and future employees.</p>
<p>First, you should determine how you want to split the equity between the founders. There is no standard for doing so — some founders split shares equally, while others do 49/51 splits for control. Some founders even may have an 80/20 equity split because one founder spent an extra year on the idea.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a good equity split is one that all founders find fair. If you can&#8217;t agree on a structure, you should have a deeper discussion on whether this is the right team to work with for the next decade or more.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every time there is a rumor of a Google algorithm update, a general panic ripples through the SEO community. There is a collective holding of breath while the numbers are analyzed and then a sigh of relief (hopefully) when they survive the algorithm update unscathed.</p>
<p>After the update is released, and especially if it is confirmed by Google, a slew of articles and pundit analyses attempt to dissect what Google changed and how to win in the new paradigm.</p>
<p>I believe all this angst is entirely misplaced.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Google algorithm is made out to be some sort of mystical secret recipe cooked up in a lab designed to simultaneously rob and reward sites at the whims of a magical, all-knowing wizard. In this outdated schema, the goal of every SEO and webmaster is to dupe this wizard and come out on the winning side of every update.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Join us on Thursday, June 10 at 12:30 p.m. PDT/3:30 p.m. EDT for <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnxnlQMVajGO">a Twitter Spaces chat</a> with author Eli Schwartz.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We&#8217;ll discuss SEO and growth marketing, so bring your questions!</p>
<hr />
<p>This idea is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of what happens in a Google algorithm update — and a fundamental misunderstanding of Google. The reality is, algorithms are not your enemy. They are designed to help create a better, more accurate user experience. Here are a few pieces of perspective that should help reframe your relationship with algorithms.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Google’s algorithms are extensive and complex software programs that constantly need to be updated based on real scenarios.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Google is just trying to help</h2>
<p>First, let’s establish this: Google is only trying to help. The company wants to ensure a pleasurable, high-quality user experience for the searcher. Nothing more, nothing less. It is not a wizard, and its system is not meant to rob and reward sites arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind as we continue.</p>
<p>Google’s algorithms are extensive and complex software programs that constantly need to be updated based on real scenarios. Otherwise, they would be totally arbitrary. Just as bugs are reported and fixed in a software program, search engines must discover what’s not working and create solutions.</p>
<p>Google, like any other software company, releases updates with big leaps forward to its products and services. However, in Google’s case, they are called “major algorithm updates” instead of just product updates.</p>
<p>You are now armed with the knowledge of exactly what a Google algorithm update is. Is it not, then, gratifying to know there is never a reason to panic?</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">Respond to our survey</a> and help us find the best startup growth marketers!</p>
<hr />
<h2>A drop in search traffic isn’t necessarily hurting you</h2>
<p>If a site experiences a drop in search traffic after a major algorithm update, it is rarely because the entire site was targeted. Typically, while one collection of URLs may be demoted in search rankings, other pages likely improved.</p>
<p>Seeing the improved pages requires taking a deep dive into Google Search Console to drill into which URLs saw drops in traffic and which witnessed gains. While a site can certainly see a steep drop off after an update, it is usually because they had more losers than winners.</p>
<p>Any drop is most definitely not because the algorithm punished the site.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XELFua4lwF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/even-startups-on-tight-budgets-can-maximize-their-marketing-impact/">Even startups on tight budgets can maximize their marketing impact</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Even startups on tight budgets can maximize their marketing impact&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/even-startups-on-tight-budgets-can-maximize-their-marketing-impact/embed/#?secret=XELFua4lwF" data-secret="XELFua4lwF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>If you see a drop, in many cases, your site might not have even lost real traffic; often, the losses represent only lost impressions already not converting into clicks. With a recent update, Google removed the organic listing of sites that had a featured snippet ranking. I saw steep drops in impressions, but the clicks were virtually unchanged. Gather and study your granular data for a clearer rendering of information rather than assuming the site has become a winner or loser after an update.</p>
<h2>Focus on a great user experience, just like Google</h2>
<p>Websites that focus on providing an amazing and high-quality experience for users shouldn’t fear algorithm updates. In fact, updates can provide the needed impetus to excel. The only websites that have something to fear are those that should not have had high search visibility in the first place because of a poor user experience.</p>
<p>If your website provides a great experience for users, updates are actually likely to help you because they winnow those poorer quality sites out of the running.</p>
<p>If you focus on a good user experience, there will be pages that may lose some traffic in algorithm updates, but in aggregate, the site will typically gain traffic in most scenarios. Digging into the granular data of what changed will likely support the idea that websites do not suffer or benefit from algorithm updates &#8212; only specific URLs do.</p>
<h2>Updates are a fact of search life</h2>
<p>Google will, and should, continuously update its algorithms. Google’s primary motivation is to have an evolving product that will continue to please and retain its users.</p>
<p>Consider that if Google leaves its algorithm alone, it risks being overrun by spammers that take advantage of loopholes. A search function that provides too many spammy results will soon go the way of AOL, Excite, Yahoo and every other search engine that is functionally no longer in existence. Google stays relevant by updating algorithms.</p>
<p>Updates are a part of search life.</p>
<h2>Chase the user, not the algorithm</h2>
<p>Instead of chasing the algorithm, which will inevitably change, I believe that every website that relies on organic search should train its focus somewhere more important: on the user experience.</p>
<p>The user is the ultimate customer of search. If your site serves the user, it will be immunized from algorithm updates designed to protect the search experience. There is no algorithm wizard — only SEO masters who have figured out how to apply best processes, best procedures and actions for your website.</p>
<p>Algorithms and updates have only one purpose: help a user find exactly what they seek. Period. If you are helpful to the user, you have nothing to fear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To succeed, every startup needs to find and keep more users, but our attention spans get shorter every year. Eventually, your company will hire someone who&#8217;s up to speed with the latest problems and solutions in growth.</p>
<p>In the meantime, TechCrunch is here to help.</p>
<p>We’re asking founders to <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">share a brief recommendation</a> for talented growth marketers who have made a difference for them. We’ll use your responses to feature the best growth experts to our audience through our articles, events, and soon, a free database list.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whether you worked with a great individual or an agency, we want to know who helped you figure out great solutions in SEO, social media, content marketing, analytics and other growth mechanisms.</p>
<p>There are a million marketers out there, most of whom have never worked with serious startups before. The types of people we want to spotlight will be proven experts in using product management, engineering, data and marketing techniques specifically for ambitious companies like yours.</p>
<p>If you are a growth marketer, we encourage you to share this survey with your clients (but completely discourage self-recommendations).</p>
<p>Founders and other startup leaders, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">please fill out this nomination form</a>, and be on the lookout for more from top marketers in the next few weeks (with a few more things in store). If you had filled out our email marketing survey from a few weeks ago, thank you! We’re putting your responses to work as part of this project already.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today launched the second beta of Android 12. The first beta, which launched at Google&#8217;s I/O conference in May, introduced us to the first glimpses of Google&#8217;s new &#8220;Material You&#8221; design system, though many of the promised new features and design tweaks weren&#8217;t part of this first beta yet. With this new beta, Google is bringing more of these to its testers (you can sign up for the beta <a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">here</a>), including its new privacy dashboard that makes it easier for users to see which apps recently used a phone&#8217;s microphone, camera and location.</p>
<p>Other new features available in the beta are the addition of microphone and camera indicators that show users if an app is using those, as well as new Quick Setting toggles to disable app access to them. When access is toggled off, apps will receive blank audio and camera feeds. Related to this, Google is also bringing a clipboard read notification to Android that shows readers when an app is reading from the clipboard.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163860" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163860" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163860" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="745" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2163860" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Also new in beta 2 is a new Internet Panel that makes it easier for you to switch between internet providers, Wi-Fi networks, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163859" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163859" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163859" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1026" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png 2044w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=768,770 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=1533,1536 1533w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2163859" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>With this release, Google is now one release away from reaching platform stability in August. As the company notes, now would be a good time for developers to finish their compatibility testing and release compatible versions of their apps, SDK and libraries. Given the current monthly release cadence, we&#8217;ll likely see a final release of Android 12 in September.</p>

<p>Like before, you&#8217;ll need a compatible device to try out the beta. Unlike with some the earlier preview releases, this list includes a lot of non-Google devices, with Sharp joining the beta program today, for example. You can find a full list of supported devices &#8212; and instructions for how to get started on non-Google devices &#8212; <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I started a tech company about two years ago, and ever since I’ve dreamed of expanding my company in the United States. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I would love to have a green card. Someone mentioned that I should apply for a diversity green card. Would you please provide me with more details about it and how to apply?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Technical in Tanzania</strong></p>
<p>Dear Technical,</p>
<p>As a startup founder from Tanzania, you have several immigration options available to you, including the Diversity Immigrant Visa (green card) Program.</p>
<p>My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, and I recently discussed the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Diversity-Visa/DV-Instructions-Translations/DV-2022-Instructions-Translations/DV-2022-Instructions-and-FAQs_English.pdf">Diversity Immigrant Visa Program</a> (DV Program) on a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/074-diversity-immigrant-visa-program/">podcast episode</a>. Take a listen for how to apply and tips for applying. Each year, the U.S. Department of State, which oversees the DV Program, reserves 50,000 green cards for individuals born in countries that have low rates of immigration to the United States. The State Department publishes instructions each year, which includes the countries whose natives are eligible to register for the annual diversity lottery. Here is <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Diversity-Visa/DV-Instructions-Translations/DV-2022-Instructions-Translations/DV-2022-Instructions-and-FAQs_English.pdf">the latest version</a>.</p>
<h2>How does the diversity lottery work?</h2>
<p>You must register online in the fall — usually from early October through early November — for the annual random lottery by completing the Electronic Diversity Visa Entry Form (DS-5501). There is no cost to register for the lottery, but be aware that you will be automatically disqualified if you register yourself more than once, and incomplete forms will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Once you complete the online registration form, you will get a confirmation number. Do not lose this number! It is the only way to access the online system that will tell you whether you were selected in the lottery and are eligible to submit a green card application. In May, registrants can log into the online system to find out whether they’ve been selected. No notification will be sent by email or snail mail; checking online by entering your confirmation code is the only way to find out. After you enter your confirmation code online, you will receive a diversity visa number, which you will use to determine when you can file your green card application.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German electric air mobility company Lilium has partnered with aerospace manufacturer Honeywell to develop the electronics and mechanical systems for the 7-seater Lilium Jet, the company’s debut eVTOL.</p>
<p>Honeywell will supply its compact fly-by-wire system, a flight control component that will be responsible for controlling all of the Jet’s moving parts, and the aircraft&#8217;s avionics system. eVTOL company Vertical Aerospace is also using Honeywell’s compact fly-by-wire system in its aircraft, but the avionics system for the version Lilium will be using was designed to suit the specific technical requirements of the Lilium Jet.</p>
<p>Honeywell is a giant in the aerospace manufacturing industry, and one of the first to create a dedicated Urban Air Mobility team. The company has also become an investor in Lilium by participating in the common stock private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering announced in connection with Lilium’s SPAC merger with Qell Acquisiton Corp.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two companies have been in discussion and collaboration since February 2019, Lilium’s chief program officer Yves Yemsi told TechCrunch. He said Lilium identified core competencies it wanted to keep in-house — the design and assembly of the propulsion and battery systems and the final aircraft assembly, for example — and will partner with experienced suppliers for other parts of the aircraft.</p>
<p>“Collaborating with experts, aerospace partners, is a deliberate choice for us,” he said. “It will help us to reduce our time to market and still be safe.”</p>
<p>A key advantage of the partnership is how it will help the certification process, Yemsi explained. Some of Honeywell&#8217;s components have achieved a Technical Standard Order (TSO), which is a minimum performance standard recognized by the FAA. Using TSO-authorized components could help save time in the certification process.</p>
<p>Lilium already has teams of people working on getting Design Production Approval and Production Organization Approval, two types of approvals issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) that essentially verify the company is able to bring a product to market. These approvals complement the type certification that Lilium aircraft (and all other eVTOL) must achieve with both the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the EASA before the company can start commercial operations.</p>
<p>The partnership with Honeywell, an established aerospace manufacturer, marks a major point of progress for Lilium. The next step after Honeywell starts delivering components is to develop and test the aircraft in a system integration laboratory, which tests on the ground that the avionics and electronic systems, Yemsi said.</p>
<p>“Now the hard work begins,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even as NFT sales dip below their most speculative highs, startups aiming to tap into their potential are still scoring big funding rounds from investors who believe there&#8217;s much more to crypto collectibles than the past few months of hype.</p>
<p><a href="https://mythicalgames.com/">Mythical Games</a>, an NFT games startup based out of Los Angeles, has banked a $75 million raise from new and existing investors betting on the startup&#8217;s aim to expand the ambitions of their first title and locate a substantial platform opportunity amid helping developers build blockchain-based gaming experiences.</p>
<p>The round was led by WestCap. Existing investors were joined by 01 Advisors and Gary Vaynerchuk&#8217;s VaynerFund in the Series B funding. The startup has raised a whopping $120 million to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has been building a title called Blankos Block Party that seems to be Fall Guys meets Roblox meets Funko Pop. The PC game capitalizes on a number of big social gaming trends around user-created content, while adding in a marketplace where users can buy avatar figures and accessories crafted by a variety of artists and designers that Mythical has partnered with. Users can buy or sell the limited run or open edition items through their marketplace. Unlike some other NFT platforms, the goods live on a private blockchain so they can&#8217;t be re-sold on public marketplace platforms like OpenSea.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rbte61BZ00"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">NFT marketplace OpenSea raises $23 million from a16z</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NFT marketplace OpenSea raises $23 million from a16z&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/embed/#?secret=rbte61BZ00" data-secret="rbte61BZ00" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mythical Games is part of a growing movement to bring blockchain-based game mechanics mainstream while leaving behind elements of crypto platforms that are seen as less ready for primetime. Users can purchase avatars on the platform with cryptocurrency through BitPay but they can also pay with a credit card. Users don&#8217;t need to walk through the mechanics of setting up a wallet or writing down a seed phrase either.</p>
<p>While the company has big hopes for Blankos as it onboards more users, the bigger investor opportunity is likely in the game engine that the team is building. The startup&#8217;s &#8220;Mythical Economic Engine&#8221; is being designed to help budding game builders create NFT-based marketplaces that won&#8217;t get them in any regulatory trouble, marrying compliance across geographies and tools that help creators comply with anti-money laundering laws and know-your-customer frameworks.</p>
<p>&#8220;With any new market like [NFTs], it goes through all these different cycles,&#8221; Mythical Games CEO John Linden tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We think this will actually change gaming for the long haul. The more we talk to game studios, we’re finding more and more potential use cases.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After co-founding Insomnia Consulting, Stacey Abrams and Lara O’Connor Hodgson started Nourish to address a personal problem.</p>
<p>“We were at a meeting, I think for one of my campaigns,” explains Abrams, the Georgia-based lawyer and politician whose voting rights work became a focal point for the country in 2020. “[O’Connor Hodgson] needed to put together a baby bottle and had to trust the waiter to take the bottle back and wash it. She said, ‘I just wish there was a Dasani for babies.’ ”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2163871" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="81" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png?resize=150,40 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png?resize=300,81 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Ultimately, however, Nourish ran into an issue. The company was a victim of its own successes, to hear Abrams describe it &#8212; or, more accurately, a victim of a system that didn’t provide it the right tools to grow. A problem with invoicing ultimately stopped the childcare in its tracks. But it was precisely those failings that planted the seed for their next company, the simply named Now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We started looking for a loan. All we needed was the money to meet the order. This was during the credit crunch, and we could not get it,” Abrams tells TechCrunch. “We went from bank to credit union to factoring, and every time we got near the end, the credit model changed and we got kicked out of the program. Finally, unfortunately, we had to let our business die. We grew to death. We got too big to meet the needs and didn’t have a solution.”</p>
<p>Abrams and O’Connor Hodgson founded Now in 2010 to provide small businesses a quicker method for getting invoices paid. When a business submits an invoice through NowAccount, the service pays 100% of the invoice, minus a 3% merchant fee.</p>
<p>“We sell bonds in the capital market, just like American Express does,” O’Connor Hodgson explains. “We have very low-cost capital that we’re able to give that small business their revenue immediately. And then we’ve built a system that allows us to manage the cost and risk of that, because we’re going to then wait 30+ days to get paid.”</p>
<p>Today the Georgia-based company announced that it has raised $9.5 million in Series A funding. The round, led by Virgo Investment Group and featuring Cresset Capital Partners, will be used to help scale Now’s offerings. It comes as the pandemic has put even more of a strain on invoices for many companies. O’Connor Hodgson says the average wait time for invoice payment expanded from around 50 days to between 70-80.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have served over 1,000 small businesses and we have processed over $700 million in transactions,&#8221; says O’Connor Hodgson. &#8220;So that’s $700 million of their capital that they have received sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus far, Now&#8217;s growth has largely been a product of word of mouth. The new influx of funding will go, in part, to market and advertising to get the product in front of more small businesses.</p>
<p>“When you&#8217;re a small business and someone tells you we have a solution to a problem that no one has been willing to solve, we sound like magic,” says Abrams. “And what we want people to understand and a big part of our scaling challenge has been, you have to experience it to believe it. And getting companies to understand that this actually does work the way we say that it does actually benefit you in the way we imagine, and that it works.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> has a long history of bringing leading venture capitalists to the stage to yammer about their industry. Our impending <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt conference happening on September 21-23</a> is no different. This time around one of our investor guests is <a href="https://twitter.com/ammathew?lang=en">Arun Mathew</a> of <a href="https://accel.com/">Accel</a>, a venture capitalist that you might recall from his recent participation in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/webflow-raises-140m-pushing-its-valuation-to-2-1-billion/">Webflow&#8217;s huge $140 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>But we aren&#8217;t merely asking Mathew out to the event to chat low-code, or SaaS, or simply current intra-venture capital investing dynamics. Instead, he&#8217;ll be taking part in our panel on alternative financing (alt-finance) with a few folks that aren&#8217;t venture capitalists, but still deploy capital into startups.</p>
<p>Having an Accel partner take part in the panel makes good sense, as the venture firm has an interesting way of approaching bootstrapped companies. Namely that it is willing to show up to pretty large companies and write huge checks. That&#8217;s how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/qualtrics-waits-on-that-ipo-raises-180-million-at-a-2-5-billion-valuation-instead/">Accel got into Qualtrics</a>, for example, a deal that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">worked out pretty well</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Accel invests <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel/recent_investments">from seed through super-late stage</a>, making Mathew the perfect person to bring the venture perspective to the conversation.</p>
<p>The chat should hit on revenue-based financing, other more exotic forms of alt-finance and where the venture world may see capital partnerships, and funding rivalries. Our goal won&#8217;t be to incite an argument, but instead to unfold the private capital markets in a manner that helps fans of traditional VC &#8212; if there is still such a thing in today&#8217;s Tiger Global-led world &#8212; and believers in newer methods of capital deployment learn from each other. And so that founders can carve the most reasonable path for themselves as they seek to grow their businesses.</p>
<p>All told it should be a bop and I will see you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virgin Orbit is getting ready to launch its next mission to space, with a <a href="https://www.virgin.com/about-virgin/latest/virgin-orbits-reveals-launch-window-for-next-mission-to-space">target window at the end of this month</a>. This will be the first time Virgin Orbit is flying after its first successful orbital launch in January, and it&#8217;s carrying seven small satellites on behalf of clients including the U.S. Department of Defense and the Royal Netherlands Air Force. It&#8217;s also going to be the first time everyone can watch along live as Virgin Galactic makes the trip to space, since the company is streaming the mission via YouTube.</p>
<p>Previously, Virgin Orbit has opted not to provide live video of its flights, choosing instead to provide a feed of text updates via its social media channels. The YouTube stream should provide unprecedented views of the Virgin launch process, which includes transporting its small Launcher One rocket on to a high altitude for a midair launch from the wing of a modified Boeing 747 carrier aircraft.</p>
<p>Livestreaming launches is pretty much de rigueur in the space industry at this point, especially among the crop of so-called &#8220;new space&#8221; companies that includes SpaceX, Rocket Lab and Blue Origin. SpaceX has even been doing it throughout its Starship development process, which is unusual because it&#8217;s broadcast a number of failures on top of its successes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Virgin Orbit&#8217;s novel aircraft-assisted launch process should mean its streams provide some unique perspective versus the vertical take-off group, so it&#8217;s probably worth keeping an eye on this one.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AI rounds are particularly hot or at least as hot as the larger SaaS market, which is itself enjoying historically rich multiples as more capital pours into the aggregate startup world.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The startup investing market is crowded, expensive and rapid-fire today as venture capitalists work to preempt one another, hoping to deploy funds into hot companies before their competitors. The AI startup market may be even hotter than the average technology niche.</p>
<p>This should not surprise.</p>
<p>In the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">the Microsoft-Nuance deal</a>, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">reported that it would be reasonable</a> to anticipate an even more active and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/why-its-not-surprising-to-see-nine-figure-ai-rounds/">competitive market</a> for AI-powered startups. Our thesis was that after Redmond dropped nearly $20 billion for the AI company, investors would have a fresh incentive to invest in upstarts with an AI focus or strong AI component; exits, especially large transactions, have a way of spurring investor interest in related companies.</p>
<p>That expectation is coming true. Investors The Exchange reached out to in recent days reported a fierce market for AI startups.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But don’t presume that investors are simply falling over one another to fund companies betting on a future that may or may not arrive. Per a <a href="https://www.signal-ai.com/">Signal AI survey</a> of 1,000 C-level executives, nearly 92% thought that companies should lean on AI to improve their decision-making processes. And 79% of respondents said that companies are already doing so.</p>
<p>The gap between the two numbers implies that there is space in the market for more corporations to learn to lean on AI-powered software solutions, while the first metric belies a huge total addressable market for startups constructing software built on a foundation of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Now deep in the second quarter, we’re diving back into the AI startup market this morning, leaning on notes from <a href="https://twitter.com/davidblumberg?lang=en">Blumberg Capital’s David Blumberg</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rudina11?lang=en">Glasswing Ventures’ Rudina Seseri</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/benblume?lang=en">Atomico’s Ben Blume</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jgoldfein?lang=en">Jocelyn Goldfein of Zetta Venture Partners</a>. We’ll start by looking at recent venture capital data regarding AI startups and dig into what VCs are seeing in both the U.S. and European markets before chatting about applied AI versus &#8220;core&#8221; AI &#8212; and in which context VCs might still care about the latter.</p>
<h2>Hot, expensive, crowded</h2>
<p>The exit market for AI startups is more than just the big Microsoft-Nuance deal. CB Insights <a href="https://t.yesware.com/tt/2f1386565598f726094ae2a168a6fbd1bf787596/87febc0caed6d0e2c8e834f740f5a703/b99969f3c71b842d45dcc08ca9c599c2/www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Tech-Giants-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf">reports that</a> four of the largest five American tech companies have bought a dozen or more AI-focused startups to date, with Apple leading the pack with 29 such transactions.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Apple hosts their annual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/WWDC-2021/">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>, Instagram and Facebook chose this moment to pilot their first-ever Creator Week. This three-day event is geared toward aspiring and emerging digital creators, complete with 9:45 AM virtual DJ sets and panels on &#8220;Algorithm Mythbusting&#8221; and raising &#8220;zillions for a nonprofit you care about.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the first day of the event, Mark Zuckerberg made an announcement introducing <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/creator-week-2021-new-ways-for-creators-to-make-a-living">new ways for creators to make money</a>. In the coming months, Instagram will start testing a native affiliate tool, which allows creators to recommend products available on checkout, share them with followers and earn commissions for sales their posts drive. When creators make these posts, the text &#8220;eligible for commission&#8221; will appear beneath their username in the same way that sponsored content labels appear.</p>
<p>Available immediately, creators will be able to link their shops to their personal profiles, not just business ones. By the end of the year, eligible creators in the U.S. will be able to partner with one of Instagram&#8217;s merchandise partners (Bravado/UMG, Fanjoy, Represent and Spring) to drop exclusive product launches on the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During live Instagram videos, viewers can tip creators by sending them a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/">Badge</a>, which costs between $0.99 and $4.99. Facebook Gaming has a similar feature called Stars, in which one Star is valued at $0.01. Starting this week, creators can earn bonuses for accomplishing certain challenges, like going live with another account. In a promotional image, for example, Facebook offers a bonus of $150 for creators who earn 5,000 Stars, the equivalent of $50.</p>

<p>&#8220;To help more creators make a living on our platforms, we&#8217;re going to keep paid online events, fan subscriptions, badges, and our upcoming independent news products free for creators until 2023,&#8221; Zuckerberg wrote in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113127348899371">a Facebook post</a>. &#8220;And when we do introduce a revenue share, it will be less than the 30% that Apple and others take.&#8221;</p>

<p>These updates mark the latest push by Instagram toward affiliate marketing and in-app shopping, like its redesigned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/instagram-launches-its-redesigned-shop-now-powered-by-facebook-pay/">Instagram Shop</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">Shopping in Reels</a>, which debuted within the last year.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to be the best platform for creators like you to make a living. And if you have an idea that you want to share with the world, you should be able to create it and get it out there easily and simply &#8212; across Facebook and Instagram &#8212; and then earn money for your work,&#8221; Zuckerberg added during Creator Week.</p>
<p>Creators may be drawn to experiment with these affiliate and shop features, since for now, they won&#8217;t lose a cut of their profits to Instagram. But platforms like TikTok and YouTube offer monetization strategies that extend beyond e-commerce.</p>
<p>Last July, TikTok announced its $200 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">TikTok Creator Fund</a>, which allows popular posters to earn money from their videos. It&#8217;s unclear exactly how TikTok determines <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-creator-fund-your-questions-answered">how much money</a> to dole out, but it depends on the number of views, engaged views and other factors. In August 2020, the YouTuber-turned-TikToker Hank Green estimated that he would bring home <a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1296866360908107776">about $700 from 20,000,000 TikTok views</a> in one month, averaging to about 3.5 cents per 1,000 views.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, YouTube announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">a $100 million fund</a> last month for top creators on YouTube Shorts, its TikTok competitor. The platform pointed out that over the last three years it has paid $30 billion to content creators. Snapchat has been paying <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html">$1 million per day to creators</a> on their own TikTok competitor, Spotlight.</p>
<p>For users who don&#8217;t have millions of followers, these creator funds might not pay the rent. Still, it offers an income stream based on views, outside of e-commerce or viewer tips. For now, Instagram can&#8217;t say the same.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://segment.com/?ref=nav">Twilio Segment</a> announced a tool, which is available starting today, to help marketers create fine-grained customer journeys. Until now the company has enabled marketers to build buyer personas and broader audiences, but this enables users to have much greater control of their interactions with a customer.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Peter Reinhardt says that marketers have been craving the ability to build more customized customer journeys and this tool gives them that. &#8220;It&#8217;s basically taking the power that existed in personas and audiences and actually putting it fully in marketers&#8217; hands to build their dream journeys across every channel with the best data,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This enables marketers to stitch together a whole sequence of audiences. &#8220;Say when someone comes to the top of the funnel, they want to do X, then if they want to branch it and use X or Y, then do two different things, and you can keep branching and personalizing via this whole journey to cover the whole lifecycle.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says this capability has existed in some tools, but the Twilio Segment offering enables it to be used in more than 300 tools in the Segment ecosystem. &#8220;This is the first time that we&#8217;re going to be able to really do that and orchestrate this way, not just for a limited subset of channels, but across all of the channels,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8xH29Oyl5R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic/">Customer experience and digital transformation concepts are merging during the pandemic</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Marketers can build branching by dragging and dropping journey components to send people on different paths depending on things like if they are a regular customer or a first-time customer or just about anything you can think of. Reinhardt says that flexibility is a key attribute of the new feature.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s competing with some major players like Adobe and Salesforce in this space, Reinhardt believes this capability really gives Twilio a leg up over the competitors. &#8220;I think if you look at more of the legacy journey builders, [their products] are not built on real-time data, meaning that they&#8217;re actually missing basically all of the interesting behavioral data that marketers actually build on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Segment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">was acquired by Twilio last year</a> for $3.2 billion, and part of the reason for that was to increase its customer engagement capabilities. Segment gives Twilio a customer data platform to build on top of its other communications tooling, and today&#8217;s announcement expands on that capability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish battery developer and manufacturer Northvolt AB has raised $2.75 billion in capital as it prepares to ramp up to an annual production capacity of 150 GWh in Europe by 2030.</p>
<p>The funding round &#8212; Northvolt’s largest thus far &#8212; was co-led by existing investors Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen, and new investors including the Swedish pension funds AP1-4 and OMERS, one of Canada’s largest pension plans. AMF, ATP, Baillie Gifford, Baron Capital Group, Bridford Investments Limited, Compagnia di San Paolo through Fondaco Growth, Cristina Stenbeck, Daniel Ek, IMAS Foundation, EIT InnoEnergy, Norrsken VC, PCS Holding, Scania and Stena Metall Finans also participated in the raise.</p>
<p>Volkswagen’s investment came to €500 million ($620 million), the OEM said Wednesday, maintaining its 20% stake in the battery manufacturer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/09/northvolt-raises-2point75-billion-from-goldman-vw-to-compete-with-tesla.html">CNBC reported</a> that Northvolt’s valuation now stands at $11.75 billion. The company declined to comment on the specific valuation figure to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Northvolt has already scored major deals with automakers like Volkswagen and BMW. In July 2020, the company inked a $2.3 billion contract with BMW for batteries; more recently, in March, Volkswagen put in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/swedish-battery-manufacturer-northvolt-receives-a-14-billion-order-from-vw/">$14 billion order</a> over a 10-year period. The two deals bring Northvolt’s total contracts to $27 billion. Other notable customers include Swedish heavy-duty truck manufacturer Scania and energy storage company Fluence.</p>

<p>This brings Northvolt’s total raised to more than $6.5 billion since the company was founded in 2016. The manufacturer’s first gigafactory in Skellefteå, Sweden, will be expanded from 40 GWh to 60 GWh, in part due to increased demand from the Volkswagen order, the company said in a statement. That facility will commence production later in 2021.</p>
<p>Northvolt’s overarching plan is to ramp up to at least 150 GWh of annual battery production across Europe by 2030. To meet this massive target, the company is considering at least two additional gigafactories, including one in Germany.</p>
<p>Northvolt is one of Europe’s largest battery manufacturers. Company shareholder EIT InnoEnergy said in a statement Wednesday that the funding is key to Europe achieving its Green Deal objectives, which includes creating a European battery value chain.</p>
<p>The Swedish company aims to distinguish itself from other battery manufacturers by producing batteries using renewable energy for the manufacturing process. Northvolt says its batteries have an 80% lower carbon footprint than those made with coal power. It also recycles batteries in-house and reuses the raw materials in its production process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden is reducing some uncertainty faced by Chinese tech companies in the United States, erasing parts of the Trump-era legacy. The president signed an executive order revoking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/">actions targeting TikTok and WeChat</a> put forward by former President Donald Trump, according to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/09/executive-order-on-protecting-americans-sensitive-data-from-foreign-adversaries/">statement</a> released by the White House on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Instead, President Biden signed a new order requiring the Commerce Department to review apps with ties to &#8220;jurisdiction of foreign adversaries&#8221; that may pose national security risks.</p>
<p>Former President Trump&#8217;s orders seeking to ban TikTok and WeChat in the U.S. had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/tiktok-stars-got-a-judge-to-block-trumps-tiktok-ban/">blocked by federal court jurisdictions</a>. Separately, his attempt to force a sale of TikTok&#8217;s U.S. operations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">was also shelved</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The &#8220;increased use in the United States of certain connected software applications designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned or controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of, a foreign adversary,&#8221; which the Secretary of Commerce has defined to include China among others, &#8220;continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scrutiny over Chinese tech firms will most likely remain a high priority for U.S. regulators, but policies may be more methodical under the presidency of Joe Biden. Chinese companies coveting the U.S. market will have to be better prepared for data compliance challenges.</p>
<p>The order directs the secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the secretary of State, the secretary of Defense, the attorney general, the secretary of Health and Human Services, the secretary of Homeland Security, the director of National Intelligence, and the heads of other agencies as the secretary of Commerce deems appropriate, to recommend actions to protect Americans&#8217; data on platforms owned or controlled by a &#8220;foreign adversary&#8221; within 120 days.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that American tech companies like Facebook and Google also collect large amounts of user data, but the “scope and scale” of TikTok’s app’s data collection makes it easier for Chinese spies to answer “all kinds of different intelligence questions” on U.S. nationals, Anne Neuberger, NSA’s director of cybersecurity, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/nsa-anne-neuberger-hackers-covid-19/">told TechCrunch at Disrupt 2020</a>. She said there were “greater concerns on how [China] in particular could use all that information collected against populations other than its own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chinese tech firms have produced a raft of top-ranking apps in the U.S. TikTok, which has been working to make Singapore its beachhead following the U.S. government&#8217;s attempted ban, came in second among the free apps on the U.S. App Store as of writing. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/capcut-bytedance-tiktok/">CapCut</a>, a video-editing app also owned by ByteDance app, has seen a surge in downloads in the U.S. recently. Mobile games from Tencent and smaller studios continue to rack up big bucks in the U.S., and fast-fashion shopping app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/shein-overtakes-amazon/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Shein</a> is outpacing Amazon&#8217;s growth in the country.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, Tencent and ByteDance could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. Naturally, we do this by having candid conversations with founders and their investors.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll sit down with MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner Marlon Nichols and Wonderschool co-founder and CEO Chris Bennett. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-mac-venture-capital-and-wonderschool?ref=cc6fdfd74b4f">REGISTER HERE FOR FREE!</a></p>
<p>Not only will we discuss how they came together for Wonderschool&#8217;s seed round in 2017, but how that translated into what has become a total of $24 million in funding from VCs like a16z and First Round Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll also host the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, where folks in the audience can pitch their startup to Nichols and Bennett to get their live feedback.</p>
<p>Nichols is a former Kauffman Fellow and Investment Director at Intel Capital. His portfolio includes Gimlet Media, MongoDB, Thrive Market, PlayVS, Fair, LISNR, Mayvenn, Blavity and Wonderschool. Nichols knows more than most of us will ever learn about seed-stage fundraising, and even gave a chat at TechCrunch Early Stage in April that outlines four strategies for securing seed funding.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll get even deeper on that subject with Nichols, and hear the perspective from the other side of the table with Bennett.</p>
<p>Wonderschool is a network of early childhood programs that combine the quality of top-notch early education with an in-home setting.</p>
<p>Bennett can talk extensively on edtech as a sector, and we&#8217;ll pick both his and Nichols&#8217; mind on that fast-growing space.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that this episode will feature an Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, so founders in the audience should be ready to &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; and get in the mix.</p>
<p>The episode goes down on Wednesday, June 16 at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://ourbranch.com/?utm_source=press&amp;utm_campaign=seriesb">Branch Insurance</a>, a startup offering bundled home and auto insurance, has raised $50 million in a Series B funding round led by Anthemis Group.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Acrew, Cherry Creek Holdings and existing backers Greycroft, HSCM Bermuda, American Family Ventures, SignalFire, SCOR P&amp;C Ventures, Foundation Capital and Tower IV also participated in the round. With this latest financing, Columbus, Ohio-based Branch has raised $82.5 million in total funding since its 2017 inception.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With so many players in the insurtech space, it can get tough distinguishing the various offerings. Branch claims that it is unique in that it is able to provide customers with “an instant insurance offer” for bundled home and auto insurance “within seconds” using just a few pieces of information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Co-founder and CEO Steve Lekas began his career at Allstate, where he went on to hold roles in underwriting, technology and product management. He then went on to build Esurance’s first online home insurance business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But in the back of his mind, Lekas yearned to figure out a way to make insurance more accessible for more people. And so he teamed up with Joe Emison, and Branch was born.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The industry is structurally flawed and it harms consumers. Complicated policies, rising costs and marketing warfare all contribute to a vicious cycle that results in overpriced insurance,” said Lekas. “We are a full-stack insurance company transforming the way people think about their home and car insurance.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Branch, he claims, is the only insurance company that he is aware of that can bind insurance through an API, and the only one that can bundle auto and home insurance in a single transaction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another way Branch is unique, according to Lekas, is that it can be embedded into the buying experience. In other words, the company has partnered with companies such as Rocket Mortgage and ADT to integrate insurance at the point of sale in their products. For example, if a person is closing on a home, they have the option of purchasing Branch insurance at the same time.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Every home or car policy starts with another transaction,” Lekas said. “Insurance is a product that exists only because of the other transaction. It’s never before been possible to embed in that primary purchase before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">This distribution model means that Branch shells out less to acquire customers and thus, it claims, is able to offer premiums for a lower price than competitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In just two clicks, a consumer can have home and car insurance or just home and we’ll cancel the old insurance on their closing date, and transmit all the data to their existing mortgage,” Lekas said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Branch also offers its insurance direct-to-consumer and through agencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company plans to use its new capital in part to accelerate its rollout across the U.S. so that it can sign more such partnerships where it can embed its offering. Currently, Branch has more than 30 partnerships of varying sizes, and is “adding more every week” as it launches in more states.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s really hard to move quickly,” Lekas said. “The system is built to make you move slowly. Every state regulator has to approve individually and independently with their own rules.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lekas predicts Branch will be available in more than 80% of the U.S. before the year’s out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Branch has seen increased momentum since its $24 million Series A in July 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Specifically, the startup says it has achieved a 435% growth in its partner channel, 660% growth in active policies and a 734% increase in active premium less than one year after its last raise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anthemis Group Partner Ruth Foxe Blader notes that Branch marks her firm’s first investment from its new growth fund.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blader says she has invested in insurance innovation over the past decade, and is particularly attracted to insurtech businesses that represent three things: significant technology and data science innovation; significant product innovation and significant cultural innovation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Branch easily ticks those boxes,” Blader told TechCrunch. “Branch&#8217;s products are both embedded and bundled, making them less expensive and more convenient to purchase, and less likely to leave customers with critical protection gaps.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup, she added, effectively combines data science and technology to create “unique, automatic product bundles.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">With what it describes as a “built-for-savings” structure, Branch said it has created connected home discounts as well as programs that reward members for making referrals and practicing safe driving behaviors, for example.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Branch also has formed a nonprofit, <a href="https://www.safetynest.org/">SafetyNest</a>, to help those who are un- or underinsured.</p>
