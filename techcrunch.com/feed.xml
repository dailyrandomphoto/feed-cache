										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embedded finance continues to be the engine driving the growth of fintech, with one group of companies building core banking, payments and other financial technology, and a much bigger group tapping that technology through APIs to build customer-facing businesses. Today, one of the bigger players on the core technology side &#8212; <a href="https://www.globalprocessing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Processing Services</a> &#8212; is announcing $100 million in funding, a sign not just of how popular embedded finance remains as a business, but also GPS&#8217;s traction in the space.</p>
<p>Singapore investor <a href="https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/index&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642146336177000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3f6yxl3wskI3TvnPcSUhvr">Temasek</a> and US firm <a href="https://missionog.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://missionog.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642146336177000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0svNJgeDq64VSy8O1wzNK3">MissionOG</a> are the two sole investors in this tranche of funding, which is coming in the form of an extension of a $300 million investment that GPS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/global-processing-services-raises-300m-its-api-based-payments-and-embedded-finance-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> back in October 2021, closing out the full round at $400 million. <a href="http://www.globalprocessing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.globalprocessing.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642146336177000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0wbY9HRwJoN4Dsv3CpaNr9">Advent International</a> and <a href="https://www.vikingglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vikingglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642146336177000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0YIOiZSFe-1yqJdk9_tX3F">Viking Global Investors</a> co-led that previous round, which gave them a controlling stake in GPS. As with the earlier part of the round, GPS &#8212; which is based on the Isle of Man, in England &#8212; is not disclosing its valuation today.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to continue growing GPS&#8217;s business &#8212; which includes a range of fintech services such as payments, direct debits, and standing orders; virtual cards; mobile wallets; fraud prevention; expense management; cryptocurrency management; BNPL and more (these are sold under the <a href="https://www.globalprocessing.com/gps-apex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPS Apex</a> brand).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257315" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Specifically, the company wants to expand further in Europe and Asia Pacific, as well as in more emerging markets across the Middle East and Africa; and it wants to bring on new products. (Notably, there are no loan products in the mix right now, so that could be one area it explores; insurance could be another, and so could solutions tailored for specific verticals.)</p>
<p>The reason for the investment and investor attention is that GPS, and the space it&#8217;s active in, have both seen a big surge of activity. One one hand, neobanking services among consumers and businesses have been rising in popularity (and credibility); on the other, we&#8217;ve seen an ever-expanding range of non-fintech businesses (such as telcos and retailers) that are tapping the concept of embedded finance to add new features and revenue streams into their own platforms.</p>
<p>More generally, consumers and businesses made a big shift to carrying out all of their financial activities online as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold of the world, and even as/if that abates, it looks like they will not completely go back to their analogue ways. That has had a knock-on effect on venture funding for the whole fintech industry. It was just yesterday that another big player in fintech, the payments startup Checkout, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-40b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a whopping $1 billion at a $40 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>GPS itself focuses mainly on those working more directly in fintech, with its its customers including Revolut, Starling, Curve, Zilch, and Paidy. Its said its services are being used today in 48 countries and that last year it processed more than 1.3 billion transactions, with 190 million cards now issued to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“GPS is an innovative technology company, and we believe their unique position at the heart of the global payments ecosystem ideally positions them to power the next generation of financial services,&#8221; said Gene Lockhart, the general partner at MissionOG, in a statement. &#8220;With the deep network and experience MissionOG brings to the table, we look forward to being a trusted and valued partner of Joanne and the entire team.” Notably, Lockhart is taking on a role as chair at GPS with this investment.</p>
<p>“The upsizing of this latest round of investment is an important step forward for the company and a strong endorsement of our strategy,&#8221; added Joanne Dewar, GPS&#8217;s CEO. &#8220;We are a company that has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by our commitment to innovation and the delivery of a single scalable technology platform. The expertise that our new partners bring to GPS will be invaluable as we enter our next phase of geographic expansion and technology innovation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.fintech-farm.com/">Fintech Farm</a>, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched fintech startup based in the U.K. that creates digital banks in emerging markets, confirmed to TechCrunch today that it has raised $7.4 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it plans to use the investment to launch neobanks in eight countries over the next 24 months. Flyer One Ventures and Solid led the seed round. TA Ventures, Jiji, u.ventures and AVentures Capital also participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital banks, neobanks, challenger banks or whatever you may call them, are among the biggest recipients of VC investments in fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Globally, hundreds have sprung forth the past few years to challenge incumbents in their respective markets.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257112" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Eastern Europe, for instance, Ukrainian neobank Monobank, in just the years of operations, has amassed over 4.5 million customers and more than $100 million in operating income, as claimed by the company last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After helping to scale Monobank in Europe, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/dmytro-dubilet-51975412">Dmytro Dubilet</a>, one of its co-founders, aims to do the same in emerging markets via his new company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started Fintech Farm with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mykolabezkrovnyy_fintech-farm-linkedin-activity-6884839622619267072-gTEn?trk=posts_directory">Nick Bezkrovnyy</a>, a former director at KPMG U.K. and Middleware founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandervityaz#:~:text=Alexander%20Vityaz%20is%20a%20Founder,%2C%20Deepmemo%20Rules%20Engine%2C%20Control.">Alexander Vityaz</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2021, Fintech Farm launched in its first market, Azerbaijan. It took a credit-led neobank approach by providing loans to customers with thin credit histories via cards and a mobile app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a call with TechCrunch, Dubilet said Fintech Farm’s operational model in Azerbaijan and prospective markets is to launch its app via partnerships with local banks.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Usually, it’s 50-50 partnership with a local bank,” he remarked when asked how this partnership works</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to him, Fintech Farm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is responsible for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the business side of things &#8212; the app and credit decision making processes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he partner bank holds local knowledge, license and capital as both parties co-invest in the business </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a U.K.-based fintech, Fintech Farm takes a different approach from the conventional model used by neobanks in the country (Monzo, Starling Bank, Revolut) who prefer to hold their banking license and offer the full range of financial services themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But considering its operational approach, that is, providing financial services to emerging markets, it makes sense to have a different business model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech Farm uses a different name in each country it launches, but the same design and mascot — a funny-looking lion with a lilac mane</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three months into its launch in Azerbaijan as Leobank, Fintech Farm has issued over 100,000 cards; by the end of the year, it hopes to get this number up to a million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the next two years, Fintech Farm plans to enter eight emerging markets spread across Africa and Asia, the first of which is Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a plan to launch similar businesses in around eight other markets that are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bigger than Azerbaijan, of course,” said Dubilet. “Our next market is going to be Nigeria, we have visited Nigeria a couple of times already and it is one of our favourite countries,” said Dubilet, adding that the launch will likely take place in the first quarter of 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, despite its original plan to use partner banks, Fintech Farm has done the opposite in Nigeria so far. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, the company says it has gotten a &#8220;co-operative license</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; Should Fintech Farm acquire up to 200,000 customers, the founders said it would then partner with a bank to scale further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span>Bezkrovnyy<span style="font-weight: 400;">, a determining factor for choosing a partner bank, asides from licensing and infrastructural support, will be how fast they can move to capture millions of customers and issue hundreds of millions (dollars) in loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech Farm’s key product is a card that functions as a debit card where users can withdraw funds from deposits and a credit card with a loan facility attached in the customer’s name. A savings account, deposits and transfers are some of the app’s features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria’s population is hungry for credit. Fintech Farm’s credit-led approach will serve to meet the demand (most of its revenues comes from offering loans) companies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/">FairMoney</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/">Carbon</a> have done for years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unlike these indigenous neobanks, Fintech Farm wants to use credit cards to provide cheaper and more accessible credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the credit product, we see an opportunity for a “mass credit card” in Nigeria. Currently, credit cards issued by traditional banks </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are limited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the upper-middle class,” </span>Bezkrovnyy said in a statement.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> “At the same time, APRs of credit offerings from neobanks and alternative lenders may well be over 100%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are going to fill this gap and accept those customers neglected by traditional banks and offer them fair interest rates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike most developed countries, the West African nation lacks an advanced credit bureau system to detail people’s credit histories, so there’s some scepticism to how Fintech Farm will use credit cards to operate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Dubilet is pretty confident; he cites the company’s data science teams which he describes “as one of the best in the world”, to work some magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of this financing round, Vladimir Mnogoletniy, co-founder of Genesis, the parent company of African online classifieds platform Jiji, will join Fintech Farm’s board. He is also a partner at co-lead investor Flyer One.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders believe the expertise and understanding of Mnogoletniy and his Jiji team will be pivotal to Fintech Farm’s growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Mnogoletniy said Jiji, having built one of the largest e-commerce platforms on a GMV basis, was looking for the right partner to enter the neobanking space. Investing in Fintech Farm was a strategic investment to that end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Fintech Farm carries out its expansion plans, it also intends to spend heavily on marketing and hiring talent, especially engineers and data scientists.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lipalater.com/">Lipa Later</a>, a Kenyan tech-led consumer credit platform, is planning to expand to new markets in Africa after raising $12 million in pre-Series A funding.</p>
<p>The equity and debt funding round saw the participation of Cauris Finance, Lateral Frontiers VC, GreenHouse Capital, SOSV IV LLC, Sayani Investments and Axian Financial Services.</p>
<p>The startup, a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) company founded in 2018, is now planning to enter Tanzania, Ghana and Nigeria, and expand in its existing markets, which are Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257299" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are excited to be working with our investors as we look to grow and expand to more markets in Africa. In the next 12 months, we are looking to grow and double our presence in the existing markets, even as we open in three to five new markets in Africa,” said Lipa Later co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-muli-b597b749/?originalSubdomain=ke">Eric Muli</a>.</p>
<p>Lipa Later has exclusive partnerships with retailers across these markets allowing shoppers to pay for products in installments. For instance, Lipa Later’s partnership with French retailer Carrefour (which has a regional presence) allows customers to pay for items including furniture, electronics and even perishables in monthly installments.</p>
<p>Customers pay a monthly interest rate (about 2.3% in the case of Carrefour) on the credit extended to them. The startup is planning to forge more partnerships with merchants in its plan to cover more countries across Africa.</p>

<p>“Lipa Later is not only changing the consumer credit landscape across Africa, which to date has been largely inaccessible for most, but also catalyzing the future of shopping, e-commerce and payments. They&#8217;ve done this in a truly product and customer-led way that benefits both merchants and consumers, and has proven to be incredibly scalable across multiple markets,” said GreenHouse Capital partner Ruby Nimkar.</p>
<p>Lipa Later’s proprietary credit scoring and machine learning system allows consumers to sign up and get a credit limit almost instantly. The startup has also built a BNPL API that integrates into e-commerce platforms that enables merchants to sell products directly to consumers and makes it possible for consumers to remit monthly installments for items purchased.</p>
<p>The new funding adds on to an undisclosed 2020 investment by Tokyo-headquartered Uncovered Fund, which invests in early and seed stage startups in Africa. Lipa Later was among five startups that received the funding.</p>
<p>Lipa Later is among the leading players in Kenya’s BNPL market, where it competes with Aspira, Miti, Flexpay Technologies and Julla. According to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211018005392/en/Kenya-Buy-Now-Pay-Later-Markets-Report-2021-BNPL-Payments-are-Expected-to-Grow-by-74.1-to-Reach-89.8-Million-in-2021---Forecast-to-2028---ResearchAndMarkets.com">this</a> 2021 survey about Kenya, the BNPL payment industry in the country has experienced a strong growth owing to a rapid e-commerce penetration, and the effects of the economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The BNPL industry in Kenya is expected to record a CAGR of 30.8% during 2021 to 2028. The Gross BNPL merchandise value is expected to reach $589.5 million in 2028 up from $51.6 million in 2020.</p>
<p>In its bid to traverse Africa, where opportunities abound as e-commerce and alternative credit sources grow, Lipa Later will have to contend with competition from South Africa’s Payflex (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/zip-acquisition-of-payflex-means-africa-is-ripe-for-bnpl-disruption/">which was recently acquired by Australian BNPL Zip</a>) and PayJustNow, and Nigeria’s PayQart and Carbon Zero.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company touts its Fine Mycelium process as the only mycelium engineered to be made-to-order and made-to-specification.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mycoworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MycoWorks</a>, a company making a fungal-based biomaterial that can replace leather, brought in a fresh round of funding — $125 million in Series C financing — to fund a production plant for scaling the manufacture of its flagship product Reishi.</p>
<p>CEO Matt Scullin says what his company is doing in terms of fabrics is different from its competitors, touting the company’s Fine Mycelium process as “a biotechnology platform that engineers mycelium to grow the only made-to-order, made-to-specification luxury material.”</p>
<p>“A lot is happening in this space,” he added. “Mycelium is a tunable material, and a lot of folks are entering the space because they see opportunity for it. However, their main approach is taking fibers and embedding them in plastic, which results in a low-quality material like ‘pleather.’”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257113" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indeed, the California-based company, founded in 2013 by Philip Ross and Sophia Wang, is among a hot trend of companies working with fungus and other plant-based materials to make fabrics for fashion. When we previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/john-legend-and-natalie-portman-want-you-to-try-wearing-fungus-instead-of-leather/">profiled MycoWorks in 2020 for its $45 million raise</a>, we pointed to companies like Bolt Threads (mushrooms), Ananas Anam (pineapple fibers) and Desserto (cactus leather) doing similar things.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;John Legend and Natalie Portman want you to try wearing fungus instead of leather&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/john-legend-and-natalie-portman-want-you-to-try-wearing-fungus-instead-of-leather/embed/#?secret=U3WN65uozW" data-secret="U3WN65uozW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition to using plant-based materials for fashion, other companies are finding success with fungi-based technology. Nature’s Fynd, which raised $350 million in a Series C round in 2021, created Fy, a vegan protein that can be used as a solid, liquid or powder to make sustainable foods, like meat and cheese. Atlast Food is doing something similar, making meat alternatives from gourmet mushroom mycelium. Meanwhile, MycoTechnology, which is using a fermenting process to make — among other things — a mushroom extract that blocks the undesirable flavors of other foods, closed on a Series D round of over $120 million in 2020.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Series C was led by Prime Movers Lab, with participation from new investors, notably SK Capital Partners, Mirabaud Lifestyle Impact and Innovation Fund, which joined a group of other new and existing investors. To date, the company raised $187 million in total.</p>
<p>MycoWorks launched its first partnership with Hermès in early 2021 and now has contracts in place with a range of major global luxury brands. Scullin told me that if it is a luxury brand you have heard of, the company is probably partnering with them.</p>
<p>Despite its initial workings in the luxury space, MycoWorks also aims to move toward mass scale production that would enable products at a range of price points. The funding will enable the company to do this, Scullin said.</p>

<p>The company’s new production plant will be built in Union, S.C. and comes on the heels of a successful pilot plant in Emeryville, California. That’s where MycoWorks was able to validate its tray-based process and demonstrate scalability of the Fine Mycelium process when it met a production milestone of 10,000 trays processed. Scullin expects the plant to be operational in the next 12 months and will initially be able to produce volumes of several million square feet of Fine Mycelium per year.</p>
<p>To meet the demand for sustainable goods driven by consumers, Scullin also plans to invest the financing into expanding the team, R&amp;D and technology development. The company received thousands of inbound requests from brands to be selected to be the first to use Fine Mycelium.</p>
<p>He estimates that $150 billion of leather products are sold each year, which means the opportunity is big, especially as that consumer tailwind continues to be “one of the powerful forces in the economy right now,” he added.</p>
<p>When choosing Prime Movers Lab and others to invest in the round, Scullin said that all of them had a common expertise in biotechnology and manufacturing scale-up, which was needed by the company right now.</p>
<p>“What MycoWorks has achieved with its Fine Mycelium platform is not just a breakthrough, it is a revolution for industries that are ripe for change,” said David Siminoff, general partner at Prime Movers Lab, in a written statement. “This opportunity is massive and we believe that unrivaled product quality combined with a proprietary scalable manufacturing process has MycoWorks poised to serve as the backbone of the new materials revolution.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">decision by Austria&#8217;s data protection watchdog upholding a complaint against a website related to its use of Google Analytics does not bode well for use of US cloud services in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The decision raises a big red flag over routine use of tools that require transferring </span>Europeans&#8217; personal data to the US for processing &#8212; with the watchdog finding that IP address and identifiers in cookie data are the personal data of site visitors, meaning these transfers fall under the purview of EU data protection law.</p>
<p>In this specific case, an IP address &#8220;anonymization&#8221; function had not been properly implemented on the website. But, regardless of that technical wrinkle, the regulator found IP address data to be personal data given the potential for it to be combined &#8212; like a &#8220;puzzle piece&#8221; &#8212; with other digital data to identify a visitor.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256810" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Consequently the Austrian DPA found that the website in question &#8212; a health focused site called netdoktor.at, which had been exporting visitors&#8217; data to the US as a result of implementing Google Analytics &#8212; had violated Chapter V of the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which deals with data transfers out of the bloc.</p>
<p>&#8220;US intelligence services use certain online identifiers (such as the IP address or unique identification numbers) as a starting point for the surveillance of individuals,&#8221; the regulator notes in the decision [via a machine translation of the German language text], adding: &#8220;In particular, it cannot be excluded that these intelligence services have already collected information with the help of which the data transmitted here can be traced back to the person of the complainant.&#8221;</p>
<p>In reaching its conclusion, the regulator assessed various measures Google said it had implemented to protect the data in the US &#8212; such as encryption at rest in its data centers; or its claim that the data &#8220;must be considered as pseudonymous&#8221; &#8212; but did not find sufficient safeguards had been put in place to effectively block US intelligence services from accessing the data, as required to meet the GDPR&#8217;s standard.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as the second respondent himself [i.e. Google] has the possibility to access data in plain text, the technical measures invoked cannot be considered effective in the sense of the above considerations,&#8221; it notes at one point, dismissing the type of encryption used as inadequate protection.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Austria&#8217;s regulator also quotes earlier guidance from German DPAs to back up its dismissal of Google&#8217;s &#8220;pseudonymous&#8221; claim &#8212; noting that this states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; &#8230;the use of IP addresses, cookie IDs, advertising IDs, unique user IDs or other identifiers to (re)identify users do not constitute appropriate safeguards to comply with data protection principles or to safeguard the rights of data subjects. This is because, unlike in cases where data is pseudonymised in order to disguise or delete the identifying data so that the data subjects can no longer be addressed, IDs or identifiers are used to make the individuals distinguishable and addressable. Consequently, there is no protective effect. They are therefore not pseudonymisations within the meaning of Recital 28, which reduce the risks for the data subjects and assist data controllers and processors in complying with their data protection obligations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The DPA&#8217;s wholesale dismissal of any legally relevant impact of the bundle of aforementioned &#8220;Technical and Organizational Measures&#8221; (such as standard encryption) &#8212; which were cited by Google to try to fend off the complaint &#8212; is significant because such claims are the prevailing tactic used by US-based cloud giants to try to massage compliance and ensure EU-to-US data transfers continue so they can continue business as usual.</p>
<p>So if this tactic is getting called out here, as a result of a single website&#8217;s use of Google Analytics, it can and will be sanctioned by EU regulators elsewhere. After all, Google Analytics is everywhere online.</p>
<p>(See also the extensive list of extremely standard measures cited by Facebook in an internal assessment of its EU-to-US data transfers&#8217; &#8212; in which it too tries to claim &#8216;compliance&#8217; with EU law, per an earlier<a href="https://noyb.eu/en/4th-advent-reading-facebook-fully-ignores-schrems-rulings-court-justice"> document reveal</a>.)</p>
<p>The complaint back story here is that back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/eu-websites-use-of-google-analytics-and-facebook-connect-targeted-by-post-schrems-ii-privacy-complaints/">August 2020</a> European privacy campaign group noyb filed a full 101 complaints with DPAs across the bloc targeting websites with regional operators that it had identified as sending data to the US via Google Analytics and/or Facebook Connect integrations.</p>
<p>Use of such analytics tools may seem intensely normal but &#8212; legally speaking, in the EU &#8212; it&#8217;s anything but because EU-to-US transfers of personal data have been clouded in legal uncertainty for years.</p>
<p>The underlying conflict boils down to a clash between European privacy rights and US surveillance law &#8212; as the latter affords foreigners zero rights over how their data is scooped up and snooped on, nor any route to legal redress for whatever happens to their information when it&#8217;s in the US, making it extremely difficult for exported EU data to get the necessary standard of &#8220;essentially equivalent&#8221; protection that it gets at home when it&#8217;s abroad.</p>
<p>To radically simplify: EU law says European levels of protection must travel with data. While US law says &#8216;we&#8217;re taking your data; we&#8217;re not telling you what we&#8217;re doing; and you can&#8217;t do anything about it anyway, sucker!&#8217;.</p>
<p>US cloud providers that are subject to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) are all in the frame &#8212; which takes in a broad sweep of tech giants, including Google and Facebook, since this law applies broadly to &#8220;electronic communications services&#8221;.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12333">Executive Order 12,333</a>, a Reagan era mandate that&#8217;s also relevant as it also expanded intelligence agency powers to acquire data, is thought to target vulnerabilities in telecoms infrastructure.</p>
<p>The EU-US legal clash between privacy and surveillance dates back almost a decade at this point.</p>
<p>It was catalyized by the 2013 Snowden disclosures which revealed the extent of US government mass surveillance programs &#8212; and led, back in 2015, to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">EU&#8217;s Court of Justice to invalidate the Safe Harbor arrangement</a> between the bloc and the US on the grounds that EU data could no longer be considered safe when it went over the pond.</p>
<p>And whereas Safe Harbor had stood for around 15 years, its hastily agreed replacement &#8212; the EU-US Privacy Shield &#8212; lasted just four. So the lifespan of commercially minded European Commission decisions seeking to grease transatlantic data flows in spite of the massive privacy risks has been shrinking radically.</p>
<p>Some complaints about risky EU-to-US data transfers also date back almost a decade at this point. But there&#8217;s fresh enforcement energy in the air since a landmark ruling by the CJEU<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/"> in July 2020</a> &#8212; which struck down the Commission&#8217;s reupped data transfer arrangement (Privacy Shield), which &#8212; since 2016 &#8212; had been relied upon by thousands of companies to rubberstamp their US transfers.</p>
<p>The court did not outlaw personal data transfers to so-called third countries entirely. Which is why these data flows didn&#8217;t cease overnight smack bang in the middle of 2020.</p>
<p>However it clarified that such data flows must be assessed on a case by case basis for risks. And it made it clear that DPAs could not just turn a blind eye to compliance &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">hi Ireland!</a> &#8212; rather they must proactively step in and suspend transfers in cases where they believe data is flowing to a risky location like the US.</p>
<p>In a much watched for follow-on interpretation of the court ruling, the European Data Protection Board&#8217;s (EDPB) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">guidance</a> confirmed that personal data transfers out of the EU <em>may</em> still be possible &#8212; if a set of narrow circumstances and/or conditions apply. Such as the data can be genuinely anonymized so that it is truly no longer personal data.</p>
<p>Or if you can apply a suite of supplementary measures (such as technical stuff like applying robust end-to-end encryption &#8212; meaning there&#8217;s zero access to decrypted data possible by a US entity) &#8212; in order to raise the level of legal protection.</p>
<p>The problem for adtech firms like Google and Facebook is that their business models are all about accessing people&#8217;s data. So it&#8217;s not clear how such data-mining giants could apply supplementary measures that radically limit their own access to this core business data without a radical change of model. Or, well, federating their services &#8212; and localizing European data and processing in the EU.</p>
<p>The Austrian DPA decision makes it clear that Google&#8217;s current package of measures, related to how it operates Google Analytics, is not adequate because it does not remove the risk of surveillance agencies accessing people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>The decision puts heavy underscoring on the need for any such supplementary measures to <em>actually e</em><em>nhance</em> standard provisions if they&#8217;re to do anything at all for your chances of compliance.</p>

<p>Supplementary of course means extra. tl;dr you can&#8217;t pass off totally standard security processes, procedures, policies, protocols and measures as some kind of special Schrems II-busting legal magic, no matter how much you might want to.</p>
<p>(A quick comparable scenario that might hammer home the point: One can&#8217;t &#8212; <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-59967930">legally speaking</a> &#8212; hold a party during a pandemic if lockdown rules ban social gatherings simply by branding a &#8216;bring your own bottle&#8217; garden soirée as a work event. Not even if you&#8217;re the prime minister of the UK. At least not if you want to remain in post for long, anyway&#8230; )</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say that the the tech industry response to the Schrems II ruling has been a massive, collective putting of heads into sand. Or, as the eponymous Max Schrems himself, honorary chair of <span class="il">noyb, puts it in a statement</span>: &#8220;Instead of adapting services to be GDPR compliant, US companies have tried to simply add some text to their privacy policies and ignore the Court of Justice. Many EU companies have followed the lead instead of switching to legal options.&#8221;</p>
<p>This charade has been possible because &#8212; to date &#8212; there hasn&#8217;t been much regulatory renforcement following the July 2020 ruling.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Despite the European Data Protection Board </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/no-grace-period-after-schrems-ii-privacy-shield-ruling-warn-eu-data-watchdogs/">warning immediately that there would be no grace period</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for coming into compliance.</span></p>
<p>To the untrained eye that might suggest the industry&#8217;s collective strategy &#8212; of ignoring the legal nightmare wrapping EU-to-US transfers in the hopes the problem would just go away &#8212; has been working.</p>
<p>But, as the Austria decision indicates, regulatory gears are grinding towards a bunch of rude awakenings.</p>
<p>The European Commission &#8212; which remains eager for a replacement to the EU-US Privacy Shield &#8212; has also warned there will be no quick fix this time around, suggesting major reforms of US surveillance law are required to bridge the legal divide. (Although negotiations between the Commission and the US on a replacement data transfer agreement are continuing.)</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Schrems II enforcements are starting to flow &#8212; and orders to cease US data flows may soon follow.</p>
<p>In another sign of enforcement ramping up, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/edps-decision-european-parliament-covid-19-test-website/">just this week</a> &#8212; upheld a complaint against the European Parliament over US data transfers involving use of Google Analytics and Stripe.</p>
<p>The EDPS&#8217; <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2022-01/Case%202020-1013%20-%20EDPS%20Decision_bk.pdf">decision</a> reprimands the parliament and also orders it to fix outstanding issues within one month.</p>
<p>The other 101 complaints noyb filed back in 2020 are also still awaiting decisions. And as Schrems notes EU DPAs have been coordinating their response to the data transfer issue. So there&#8217;s likely to be a pipeline of enforcements striking at usage of US cloud services in the coming months. And, well, a lot of sand falling out of eyes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Schrems on the Austria DPA&#8217;s reasoning again: &#8220;This is a very detailed and sound decision. The bottom line is: Companies can&#8217;t use US cloud services in Europe anymore. It has now been 1.5 years since the Court of Justice confirmed this a second time, so it is more than time that the law is also enforced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect similar decisions to now drop gradually in most EU member states,&#8221; he adds, further noting that Member State authorities have been coordinating their response to the flotilla of complaints (the EDPB announced a taskforce on the issue last fall).</p>
<p>&#8220;In the long run we either need proper protections in the US, or we will end up with separate products for the US and the EU,&#8221; Schrems also said, adding: &#8220;I would personally prefer better protections in the US, but this is up to the US legislator &#8212; not to anyone in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>While netdoktor has been found to have violated the GDPR, it&#8217;s not clear whether it will face a penalty as yet.</p>
<p>It may also seek to appeal the Austrian DPA&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>The company has since moved its HQ to Germany, which complicates the regulatory jurisdiction component of this process &#8212; and means it may face additional enforcement, such as an order banning transfers, in a follow on action by a German regulator.</p>
<p>There is another notable element of the decision that has gone Google&#8217;s way &#8212; for now.</p>
<p>While the regulator upheld the complaint against netdoktor it did not find against Google&#8217;s US business for receiving/processing the data &#8212; deciding that the rules on data transfers only apply to EU entities and not to the US recipients.</p>
<p>That bit of the decision is a disappointment to noyb which is considering whether to appeal &#8212; with Schrems arguing: &#8220;It is crucial that the US providers cannot just shift the problem to EU customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>noyb further flags that Google may still face some pending sanction, however, as the Austria DPA has said it will investigate further in relation to potential violations of Article 5, 28 and 29 GDPR (related to whether Google is allowed to provide personal data to the US government without an explicit order by the EU data exporter).</p>
<p>The DPA has said it will issue a separate decision on that. So Google may yet be on the hook for a GDPR breach in Austria.</p>
<p>Penalties under the regulation can scale as high as 4% of a company&#8217;s annual global turnover. Although orders to ban data transfers may ultimately prove a lot more costly to certain types of data-mining business models.</p>
<p>To wit: Long time EU privacy watchers will be aware that Facebook&#8217;s European business is on penalty time in Ireland over this same EU-US transfers issue. A preliminary order that Facebook suspend transfers was issued by Ireland in fall 2020 &#8212; triggering legal action from the social media giant to try to block the order.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows/">Facebook&#8217;s court challenge failed</a> but a final decision remains pending from the Irish regulator &#8212; which promised noyb a swift resolution of the vintage complaint a full year ago. So the clock really is ticking on that data transfer complaint. And someone should phone Meta&#8217;s chief spin doctor, Nick Clegg, to ask if he&#8217;s ready to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">pull the plug on Facebook&#8217;s European service</a> yet?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Turnip, an Indian startup that is building a mobile-first gaming community platform, has raised $12.5 million in a new financing round to deepen its footprints in India and dozens of other countries and dabble with web3 as it looks to broaden its product offerings.</p>
<p>Greenoaks and Elevation Capital co-led the one-and-a-half-year-old startup’s Series A round. SEA Capital, Vibe Capital and scores of entrepreneurs including Andrew Chen of Andreessen Horowitz, Sujeet Kumar of Udaan, Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar of Razorpay, Gaurav Munjal and Roman Saini of Unacademy, Lalit Keshre, Harsh Jain and Ishan Bansal of Groww, and Akshay Kothari of Notion also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Several platforms such as Twitch and YouTube exist for gamers to help them distribute to an infinitely large user base. “But nobody is solving the deeper engagement and monetization,” said Pooja Dubey, founder of Turnip, in an interview with TechCrunch. “We have seen these challenges being addressed in other categories, but gaming right now has a whitespace.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257271" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://turnip.gg">Turnip</a> is attempting to solve this by allowing gamers to build a community on its app, where they can stream live gameplay from their mobile devices, engage with their fans and monetize.</p>
<p>Fans watch the gameplays within the app and can interact with the person playing the game in real-time through text chats, audio and video. Gamers can continue to stream on any platform and integrate the gameplay into Turnip to engage with their top fans. They can also host esports tournaments and masterclasses on the app to deeply engage with the audience.</p>
<p>The platform, which offers a wide-range of tools and integrations, is designed to extend support to low-specced devices as well as slower internet connections, she said.</p>
<p>Fans can tip gamers in many ways including buying items such as badges and stickers, make one-time payment to access certain events and also set up a recurring payout. The payments are orchestrated in “a more granular and step-by-step level rather than asking upfront to pay something,” she said. (Apple and Google take their 30%, while Turnip currently pockets about 10% as commission. Dubey said based on the usage and gamer’s income, the startup may change its fee.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gaming has become a social experience in recent years thanks to the rise of interactive games such as Fortnite and PUBG and availability of fast data speeds that allow friends to talk to one another in real-time as they go about completing missions and, typically, kill lots of virtual characters.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a design and development perspective, multiplayer games have lent themselves well to social features like voice chat,&#8221; said Rishi Alwani, long-time industry analyst and communications manager at SuperGaming. &#8220;Our game Silly Royale, for instance, scaled to 13 million downloads. With voice chat, we hit 3 million voice minutes in a day,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>“Today’s streamers and other creators want to cultivate deep, personalized, and persistent relationships with their fans, with a richness that’s impossible to achieve on Twitch or YouTube alone. Turnip is building a platform that transforms passive viewers into an actively engaged community, delighting fans while enabling new options for creators, from subscriptions, to events, to sponsorships, and more,” said Neil Shah, Partner at Greenoaks, in a statement.</p>
<p>Turnip has amassed over 5 million users, 45% of whom are from outside of India. In 2021, users collectively spent more than a billion minutes on the platform, the startup said.</p>
<p>“We started with India, mostly because it was the home ground. But we always had in our mind that gaming is something that transcends beyond geographies. Today we have users in 58 countries,” said Dubey. (Some of the major international markets for Turnip, by user base, are Latin America, Middle East, and Southeast Asia.)</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to deepen its footprints in Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia among other markets this year. It’s also looking to expand its team in several roles including product.</p>
<p>One of the products that Turnip is currently working on is a token that could allow community operators to reward their members and accept payments. The startup is also exploring use cases for NFTs on the platform, she said.</p>
<p>“We deeply believe in the future of mobile gaming communities that Pooja and Aditya are building,” said Mayank Khanduja, Partner at Elevation Capital, in a statement. “When we met them for the first time, we saw that they had the unique combination of skill and ambition to build a product that’s truly global,” he said, adding that the venture fund signed its first term sheet with the founders within three days of meeting when there was no product in sight.</p>
<p>“The product puts gamers, a large proportion of digital creators today, at the centre and lets them imagine completely new experiences for their community. Turnip’s spectacular growth and global reach in the past year further cements our belief in their vision and we are thrilled to reaffirm our partnership in this latest funding round.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you haven&#8217;t heard of <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/">Animoca Brands</a> over the last year or so, you haven&#8217;t been paying close attention. With a long and growing list of digital entertainment, blockchain, and gaming properties, the eight-year-old, 600-person Hong Kong-based outfit has quietly become one of the most active participants in a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/">world</a> that more and more stakeholders believe is the next iteration of the web.</p>
<p>Just today, an L.A. outfit called <a href="https://www.fcf.io/">Fan Controlled Football League</a> &#8212; a sports league where fans vote on real-time decisions for their team &#8212; announced $40 million in Series A funding co-led by Animoca. And the outfit, which got its start by developing games for smartphones and tablets, has invested in more than 150 other outfits since bumping into the blockchain around 2017.</p>
<p>It was as serendipitous as it sounds. For Animoca founder Yat Siu, it also appears to have been love at first sight. At the time, Animoca was on its way to acquiring a company called <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/completes-acquisition-fuel-powered">Fuel Powered</a>, which shared an office with a venture studio Axiom Zen, and Siu was intrigued with blockchain game that Axiom was working on called &#8220;CryptoKitties.&#8221; He learned of it from Fuel Powered&#8217;s cofounder founder, Mikhael Naayem, who was advising Axiom&#8217;s founder, Rohan Gharegozlou.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256997" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Soon after, in early 2018, Animoca struck a deal: a one-year renewable exclusive licensing and distribution agreement with Axiom Zen to publish &#8220;CryptoKitties.&#8221; It took off in such a big way that Naayem and Gharegozlou teamed up to form Dapper Labs (now known even better for its &#8220;NBA Top Shot&#8221; marketplace), and Animoca became of its earliest backers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZBtW8SHqwg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/">NBA Top Shot creator Dapper Labs raises another $250 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NBA Top Shot creator Dapper Labs raises another $250 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/embed/#?secret=ZBtW8SHqwg" data-secret="ZBtW8SHqwg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Animoca has been on an impressive tear since. Operating as both a publisher and, increasingly, a buyer of blockchain assets and tokens, its ballooning portfolio includes Sky Mavis, the developer of global sensation &#8220;Axie Infinity,&#8221; which closed on roughly $150 million in funding back in October at a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/06/sky-mavis-raises-152m-at-nearly-3b-valuation-for-axie-infinity-play-to-earn-nft-game/">$3 billion valuation</a>, and the popular metaverse startup <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/">The Sandbox</a>, a game where players can create and monetize in-game assets and that closed on <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/metaverse-startup-the-sandbox-closes-93m-series-b-led-by-softbank/">$93 million</a> in Series B funding back in November led by SoftBank. (As of last week, the smallest chunk of land users could buy in Sandbox was <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/metaverse-land-plots-decentraland-sandbox-selling-for-11000-2022-1">more than $11,000</a>.)</p>
<p>Animoca also nabbed an early stake in the NFT marketplace OpenSea, now valued at a stunning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/nft-kingpin-opensea-lands-13-3b-valuation-in-300m-raise-from-paradigm-and-coatue/">$13.3 billion</a>, and, underscoring that it&#8217;s never far from the action, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">more recently teamed up with one of the breakout projects of last year, the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/">Bored Apes Yacht Club</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, to create a Bored Apes-themed game.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s all adding up. Indeed, in a conversation late last week with Siu, he said Animoca&#8217;s holdings were worth around $16 billion as of late November, not long after Animoca was itself being valued at $2.2 billion in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2021/10/21/hong-kong-blockchain-game-maker-animoca-hits-22-billion-valuation-amid-nft-mania/?sh=5b47f2712480">$65 million funding round</a> that included Sequoia Capital China.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Sequoia and the rest of the syndicate bought up publicly traded shares. As Siu explains it, Animoca, which previously traded on the Australian Securities Exchange, was <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/delisting-faq">delisted</a> in March of 2020 because &#8220;it didn&#8217;t like the fact that we were dealing with crypto,&#8221; he says. Now it operates as unlisted public company. That means it can communicate with shareholders via its own site and mailing lists, and that its roughly 2,500 shareholders can sell their shares privately to other individuals. (You just have to know owns some.)</p>

<p>The stakes in OpenSea and Dapper Labs are meanwhile considered part of the company&#8217;s assets, with their value remaining theoretical for now. &#8220;They would be really what you describe as balance sheet items; they basically just accrue to the value of the equity of Animoca Brands,&#8221; said Siu.</p>
<p>Animoca&#8217;s success hasn&#8217;t been without speed bumps. On Monday, an Animoca subsidiary that mints sports NFTs (for nonfungible tokens), suffered a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/animoca-brands-lympo-nft-platform-hacked-for-18-7-million">security breach</a> that cause users to lose $18.7 million worth in tokens and for the subsidiary&#8217;s tokens&#8217; price to tumble 92%.</p>
<p>This brave new world comes with its own specific downsides.</p>
<p>Still, Siu, who is today Animoca&#8217;s group executive chairman and managing director, is obviously very much a believer in web3 and unsurprisingly, doesn&#8217;t put much stock in recent criticisms to surface, including around the practicality of creating fully decentralized businesses.</p>
<p>Box CEO Aaron Levie <a href="https://twitter.com/levie/status/1477052989881782272">asked recently</a> on Twitter, for example, whether truly decentralized organizations that rely on the input of their communities will be able to truly innovate if they&#8217;re always busy trying to build consensus.</p>
<p>Asked about this, Siu said, &#8220;We&#8217;re not asking that users are all visionaries,&#8221; and that &#8220;people will know what is best for them when there&#8217;s something to compare against.&#8221;</p>
<p>We also talked about how Animoca is thinking about investments and partnerships in 2022. He said the company continues to acquire game studios in order to &#8220;move them onto the blockchain and provide essentially digital property rights to the end users.&#8221; From the investing side, he added that the outfit is also drawn to infrastructure that can help  develop and grow the network effects of digital properties like NFTs.</p>
<p>As for what that means, it&#8217;s &#8220;lending, DeFi, fractionalization, protocols, and Layer 1 [blockchains], and Layer 2 [blockchains].&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fsNFXmyRkU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/">Solana, a blockchain platform followed by top crypto investors, says it&#8217;s far faster than Ethereum</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s part of Animoca&#8217;s overarching belief in &#8220;cross chains&#8221; as necessary for fast-growing outfits to keep growing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to encourage companies, when they launch their gaming assets or NFTs, to launch it on, let&#8217;s say, Ethereum, But they should also consider putting it on Flow [the blockchain designed by Dapper Labs]. And they should also put it on <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a> and they should also put it on <a href="https://hedera.com/">HBAR</a>. The whole idea is to encourage people to roll out their assets on as many platforms as possible, in as many protocols, as possible, because to us, this independence is really critical. We view chains very much like countries. If you are only able to launch a product in one place, in one country, then you&#8217;re limited to the culture and the potential of that particular place.&#8221;</p>
<p>For much more from that conversation with Siu &#8212; who grew up ethnically Chinese in Austria, landed his first job with Atari in Germany as a gangly teenager, and sold one of his first startups to a fish oil company &#8212; you can hear the whole thing <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-peek-into-web3-power-player-animoca-brands/id1498270180?i=1000547265130">here</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the recent boom of consumer-focused education learning platforms in India, the vast majority of students in the South Asian nation remain unserved. The existing B2C offerings are expensive for most of the students and are heavily skewed towards those in high school preparing for competitive exams.</p>
<p><a href="https://leadschool.in/">LEAD School</a>, a nine-year-old startup, is addressing this disconnect by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/indias-lead-school-raises-30-million-to-reach-more-students/">leveraging an infrastructure that already has a wide reach in the nation</a>: schools. And the model is working.</p>
<p>WestBridge Capital said on Thursday it led LEAD School’s Series E funding, putting $95 million alone. The new financing round, in which GSV Ventures also participated, and which pushes LEAD School&#8217;s all-time raise to $170 million, has doubled the startup&#8217;s valuation to $1.1 billion in nine months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>LEAD School, founded by couple Sumeet Mehta and Smita Deorah (pictured below), works with thousands of K-12 schools where it has integrated its platform that helps them secure books and other resources from vendors, thereby cutting middlemen and bringing quality assurance. Most of the schools serve low-income families, and LEAD estimates it will have over 5,000 schools in April when the new session starts.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical alignright wp-image-2257220" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LEAD-co-founders-sumeet-mehta-and-smita-deorah.jpg" alt="" width="535" height="803" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LEAD-co-founders-sumeet-mehta-and-smita-deorah.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LEAD-co-founders-sumeet-mehta-and-smita-deorah.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LEAD-co-founders-sumeet-mehta-and-smita-deorah.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LEAD-co-founders-sumeet-mehta-and-smita-deorah.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LEAD-co-founders-sumeet-mehta-and-smita-deorah.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LEAD-co-founders-sumeet-mehta-and-smita-deorah.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LEAD-co-founders-sumeet-mehta-and-smita-deorah.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LEAD-co-founders-sumeet-mehta-and-smita-deorah.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" /></p>
<p>But more importantly, and why the couple started LEAD School in the first place, the startup helps teachers design the curriculum and find ways to better convey the concepts to students and evaluate the learning outcome.</p>
<p>The startup works closely with students to understand the areas where they need improvements. LEAD School has found that the biggest challenge most students face is in understanding English, a factor that also impacts how they grasp most other subjects.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Focusing on clearing the fundamentals with priority has helped students in LEAD School-powered institutions score over 70% in mastery on all subjects, said Deorah in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;If India has to achieve its true potential, its schools have to significantly transform so that every child can achieve their true potential. But in K-12, everyone has been talking about edtech that is direct-to-student by circumventing schools. And everyone focuses on test prep and tuitions. Because people have accepted that schools cannot be improved. But we thought differently. A child spends six hours in school and one hour in tuition. If we can transform schools, imagine what is possible?! That’s why we focused on school edtech,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>“Typically for a school that partners with LEAD, this uplifts the students’ learning outcome by 20 to 25%,” she said, adding that the startup expects to serve 2 million students in April. &#8220;The thing that makes us proud is the students&#8217; outcome. This has what has helped us reach the scale where we are today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pandemic, which has prompted New Delhi and state governments to shut down the schools several times, has created an additional barrier for students. Most of these students are from families that don&#8217;t have multiple smartphones or other devices at home.</p>
<p>To tackle this, LEAD School has worked with teachers to offer live as well as asynchronous virtual classes so that students can watch the lessons and complete the homework with more flexibility, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are talking about households where kids don&#8217;t have personal devices. Among the children we serve, hardly five to 10 percent of their parents have purchased a tablet for them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Synchronous learning is not possible in this ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;LEAD&#8217;s quality of education is already revolutionising the way in which Indian students are taught at scale,&#8221; said Rohan Malhotra, Managing Partner at Good Capital, a venture firm that is one of the earliest backers of the startup.</p>
<p>“We are extremely proud of LEAD’s success as the largest School EdTech provider in India. LEAD’s growth last year, despite COVID disruptions, underlines its consumer first approach and deep focus on learning outcomes. We are excited to double down our investment in LEAD, to support in its mission of transforming the education sector in India and touching lives of millions of students,&#8221; said Sandeep Singhal, Managing Director at WestBridge Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>LEAD School expects to achieve an annual revenue run-rate of $80 million in the new academic year. The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to innovate on product and curriculum. It aims to reach 25 million students and scale its ARR to $1 billion.</p>
<p>With over 250 million school-going students, India is home to one of the world&#8217;s largest education markets. Indian parents spend heavily on their kids&#8217; education as they see it as a key to economic progress and a better life.</p>
<p>Scores of firms including edtech giants Byju&#8217;s, Unacademy, and Vedantu as well as American giants such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google are attempting to reach the students in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;[LEAD School] acts as the Intel inside for affordable schools and guarantees 70%+ mastery in all subjects and all grades for low/middle income students and exceeds the guarantee,&#8221; said Deborah Quazzo, Managing Partner at GSV Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We, at GSV, believe that the mastery guarantee is a revolutionary offering in K12 education space and has the potential to be societally transformational for students. With this strong and unique value proposition and exceptional management team, LEAD is well on its path to become world’s largest and most impactful school edtech company,&#8221; she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today we have to talk about things both serious and less serious. So we’re going to look at global venture capital results for 2021, and Wordle.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 12, 2022! Today we have to talk about things both serious and less serious. So we’re going to look at global venture capital results for 2021, and Wordle. A delayed IPO, and the fact that a panda-themed startup is now a unicorn. You get the idea. Let’s go! – <a href="twitter.com/alex">Alex </a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/data-show-2021-was-a-bonkers-record-setting-year-for-venture-capital/">2021 was a venture capital year par excellence</a>:</strong> Data indicate that 2021 was easily the biggest year of all time for venture capital and related private-market investing. TechCrunch dug into the major figures for the world, select geographies, and both the fintech and cybersecurity markets. Yes, you know that last year was a bit bonkers on the capital front. But we doubt you know just <em>how</em> bonkers.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-40b-valuation/">Checkout.com raises $1B at a $40B valuation</a>:</strong> Today’s mega-round of choice is one of the largest and most expensive in valuation terms that we can recall. And given that Checkout.com was worth $15 billion a year ago, the company has posted one of the fastest gains in paper value that we can recall. The lesson here is that the payments space is hot and not entirely owned by Stripe.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/unicorn-exits-augur-poorly-as-justworks-delays-ipo-citing-market-conditions/">Justworks delays its IPO, which bodes poorly for unicorn exits</a>: </strong>While venture capitalists were busy putting more money to work last year than ever before &#8212; and 2022 is kicking off in a similar manner, as the Checkout.com news shows &#8212; an IPO just got put on hold. Why? Justworks cited market conditions. For unicorns hoping to find an exit this year, the Justworks news is sub-good.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>What is a startup? It’s a question that TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/30/what-the-hell-is-a-startup-anyway/">poked at from time to time</a> (and that I have also <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/the-definition-of-a-startup/">wrangled with across</a> <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/alexwilhelm/issues/what-is-a-technology-company-885786">the internet</a>). But sometimes we care about tech products that are <em>not</em> startups. Wordle, the popular word game, is perhaps an example of the concept. As it is more website than company, its huge audience gains – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/josh-wardle-interview-wordle/">TechCrunch has the key interview with the Wordle founder here</a> – are not showering Wordle’s creator with all the benefits of its success. Owen Williams <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/wordle-is-being-punished-by-app-stores-for-choosing-the-open-web/">argues for our pages that the service is</a> “being punished by app stores for choosing the open web.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257027" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you have yet to Wordle, are you even in tech?</p>
<p>Moving along, Public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/public-appoints-first-independent-board-members-details-2021-user-growth/">has appointed new indie board members after seeing its funded account tally soar 700%</a> last year. The Robinhood competitor decided to eschew payment for order flow last year, a key revenue driver for its well-known rival. TechCrunch is curious what’s ahead for the company on the revenue side of things now that Public has reached material user scale.</p>
<p>And before we get into the day’s digest of funding events, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/dorm-room-fund-returns-to-campus-with-new-10-4-million-fund/">Dorm Room Fund is raising a new, larger fund</a> according to the keen eyes of our own <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/headspace-health-acquires-ai-powered-mental-health-and-wellness-company-sayana/">Headspace has acquired an AI-powered mental health startup</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the rounds:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/ai-powered-transcription-platform-deepscribe-raises-30m-to-unburden-doctors-from-tedious-data-entry/">DeepScribe raises $30M for medically focused transcription</a>:</strong> Doctors have to be medical providers and paperwork machines if they want to leave work on time. DeepScribe is betting that applying a little tech to the matter will help. The startup provides “ambient voice AI technology that summarizes natural patient-physician conversations,” TechCrunch writes. Neat!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/merit-grabs-50m-series-b-to-expand-digital-credentials-platform/">Helping governments build digital IDs is big business</a>:</strong> That appears to be the lesson from Merit’s new round. The startup just raised $50 million – bringing its capital base to $80 million in total – to help governments get past plastic cards and into the digital realm. Of course we have privacy worries about the concept, but at the same time, the fact that if someone steals my Social Security card it could be big trouble is some 1800s nonsense.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/tiger-doubles-down-on-seekout-which-just-raised-115m-to-help-enterprises-hire-and-retain-talent/">SeekOut lands $115M to help companies hire from a broader candidate pool</a>: </strong>Gone are the days when you could hire a team of all white dudes and not get a few questions about your biases. So even the least-enlightened companies want to do better. SeekOut may be of assistance. The startup, TechCrunch writes, “aims to help enterprises hire from a more diverse talent pool.” And Tiger Global just doubled down on the startup with another big check. One to watch.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/jakarta-based-investment-app-pluang-raises-55m-led-by-accel/">Pluang raises more capital to help Indonesians invest</a>: </strong>Using fintech services to help make investing more accessible to the less wealthy has been the goal of a number of startups. Pluang is one such company, offering its users an array of possible assets that they can buy into for small amounts. And it just landed $55 million in a round led by Accel. (The notable fact here is that Robinhood’s share price erosion post-IPO is not halting investments into private companies that could be considered comps.)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/bigpandas-gets-its-horn-after-securing-190m-in-fresh-capital/">What do you call a behorned panda</a>? </strong>Turns out the answer to that question is BigPanda, a startup that just raised $190 million at a $1.2 billion valuation. Based on a read of the company’s materials, it uses AI to parse information coming from IT systems, and also helps automate rote tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have even more rounds on TechCrunch for your enjoyment, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/newcomer-aggregator-ecommerce-brands-snags-40m-in-equity-debt-to-deploy-ecaas-model/">$40 million for Ecommerce Brands</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/travelperk-series-d-unicorn/">$115 million for TravelPerk</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/omnichannel-customer-messaging-platform-superchat-raises-15-6m-round-led-by-blossom/">$15.6 million for Superchat</a>.

<p>Game distribution platform Steam banned blockchain-based games in October 2021: Any titles that incorporate NFTs or cryptocurrency were summarily booted from the service.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, within Axie Infinity, an NFT-based online game, new players are paying hundreds of dollars to acquire mythical pets and love potions.</p>
<p>Blockchain gaming is making inroads with some consumers, but given the lack of regulatory guidance and the speculative nature of many crypto holdings, what do investors think?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Around the same time Apple was touting its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-paid-out-around-60-billion-to-app-store-developers-in-2021/">sizable App Store revenue growth</a> this week, developer and noted App Store critic <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kosta Eleftheriou</a> brought to light what appeared to be yet another App Store scammer hiding in plain sight. <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/thread/1480626605370142724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Twitter</a>, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Eleftheriou documented the earnings for a music syncing app called <a href="https://www.ampme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AmpMe</a>, which claims to boost your music&#8217;s volume by syncing it across devices, including friends&#8217; phones, Bluetooth speakers and computer speakers. AmpMe, he found, had been charging an incredible $10 per week for this basic service, which it had been promoting on the App Store by way of fake reviews.</span></p>
<p>The AmpMe<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id986905979" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> iOS app</a> doesn&#8217;t require a subscription to use some of its features, but does if you want to synchronize your music to other devices &#8212; the main reason users likely downloaded the app in the first place.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Eleftheriou <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/thread/1480626605370142724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> this offering was priced at what he called &#8220;an absurd $10/week (~$520/year).&#8221; The subscription also auto-renews, as most in-app subscriptions do. And while Apple makes it easy to sign up and stay subscribed, subscription cancelations can only be performed from your Account page&#8217;s Subscriptions section, which you can get to from the App Store or the iPhone&#8217;s Settings app. You can&#8217;t cancel inside the app itself.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256954" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2. Charge an absurd $10/week (~$520/year) auto-renewing subscription that’s easy to sign up for, but much harder to cancel: <a href="https://t.co/XxBiLTlNZ3">pic.twitter.com/XxBiLTlNZ3</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626623162425345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>AmpMe hadn&#8217;t been trying to trick users about its pricing, at least. The sign-up page clearly stated its free trial was offered for just three days and would then be followed by a $9.99 per week subscription.</p>
<p>But where the app ran afoul of the App Store&#8217;s rules was how it marketed itself to potential customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AmpMe had purchased a ton of fake reviews, as evidenced by its large slate of five-star ratings <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626639067238403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with nonsensical names</a>. These names &#8212; like Nicte Videlerqhjgd or Elcie Zapaterbpmtl, for example &#8212; looked like someone just mashed buttons on a keyboard. But the reviewers were sure to have left positive feedback, like <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s sooo good!&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;super useful&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;Don&#8217;t need any other music apps!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>(Interestingly, <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1481167415371198468" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these same reviewers left glowing five-star reviews</a> on other apps, too, and all on the same day! That&#8217;s suspicious!)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Notice how this exact same group of reviewers has also left glowing 5-star reviews in a different, unrelated app &#8211; and all on the same day.</p>
<p>The problem is widespread. <a href="https://t.co/y9b9c1C5iE">pic.twitter.com/y9b9c1C5iE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1481167415371198468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The fake reviews gave the app an overall rating of 4.3 stars on the App Store, making it seem like a legitimate and useful music syncing tool. Meanwhile, the real reviews &#8212; where legitimate App Store customers complained about the outrageous pricing, basic functionality or the obvious fake reviews &#8212; were drowned out by the spam.</p>
<p>Apple had not taken action on this deceptively marketed app for years. And to make matters worse, it had even promoted it several times through App Store editorial collections, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Eleftheriou pointed out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The conclusion he draws from this is that not only is Apple lax on hunting down App Store scammers, it may actually be disincentivized to do so because of scam apps&#8217; earnings potential. (The only other possible conclusion here is that Apple is just inept when it comes to keeping the App Store safe for consumers&#8230; which isn&#8217;t really a good look either.)</span></p>
<p>Citing data from Appfigures, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Eleftheriou notes AmpMe has pulled in $13 million in lifetime revenue on the App Store, after Apple&#8217;s cut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Another firm puts the figure even higher. </span>Apptopia told TechCrunch the app has earned $16 million since it began monetizing through in-app purchases in October 2018; $15.5 million of that was through the App Store and another $500,000 came through Google Play. The majority (or 75%) of the in-app purchase revenue came from consumers in the U.S. To date, AmpMe has seen 33.5 million lifetime installs, 38% of which are from the U.S.</p>
<p>In a response provided to TechCrunch, AmpMe disputed some of the claims being made.</p>
<p>The company said its users aren&#8217;t paying $520 per year &#8212; what a $10 per week subscription would add up to if users stayed subscribed. Instead, AmpMe said across its paying users, its average yearly subscription revenue is around $75. This would indicate users are taking advantage of the free trial then canceling the subscription after some time. AmpMe also said that, internally, this reinforced its belief that its pricing is transparent and its opt-out procedures are easy.</p>
<p>The company did not, however, have a great answer as to why its App Store Listing is filled with fake reviews, opting to toss blame on an anonymous third party instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through the years, like most startups, we’ve hired outside consultants to help us with marketing and app store optimization. More oversight is needed and that’s what we are currently working on,&#8221; a statement sent by an unnamed AmpMe representative said. (They had signed the email &#8220;The AmpMe Team.&#8221;)</p>
<p>In addition, the company said it was responding to this recent feedback by releasing a new version of the app with a lower price point.</p>
<p>&#8220;We always adhere to Apple’s subscription guidelines and are continually working to ensure their high standards are met,&#8221; the email read. &#8220;We also respect and value the community’s feedback. Therefore, a new version of the app with a lower price has already been submitted to the App Store for review.&#8221;</p>
<p>That version has since gone live and sees the weekly subscription reduced to $4.99 from $9.99.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Today, Eleftheriou tells us it looks like a manual cleanup of the fake reviews is now underway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> On Monday at 11 AM, he documented the app had 54,080 reviews. By Tuesday at 9 PM, after AmpMe <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/01/11/app-store-scam-ampme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw</a> <a href="https://www.imore.com/scam-app-ampme-rakes-13-million-back-thousands-fake-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fair bit</a> of <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/763352/app-store-13-million-fake-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad</a> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/developer-exposes-another-multimillion-dollar-scam-app-on-the-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press</a>, the app&#8217;s review count had dropped to 53,028. By 7 AM on Wednesday, the review count dropped again to 50,693. But the app&#8217;s overall rating hasn&#8217;t been meaningfully impacted. This could be because the reviews being removed are those submitted by the fake App Store users instead of the ones where the app was given a five-star rating but no review text or reviewer name is visible. That means the cleanup process will make it less obvious the app had purchased fake reviews. </span></p>
<p>Also of interest, perhaps, is AmpMe&#8217;s CEO: the Canadian technology entrepreneur Martin-Luc Archambault. His Wajam software-turned-adware <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/wajam-adware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was previously investigated by</a> the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC), and<a href="https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/enquetes/201810/03/01-5199000-un-logiciel-du-dragon-martin-luc-archambault-bafouait-la-vie-privee.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> found to have violated Canadian internet privacy laws</a> by collecting user data without consent. It also used several methods to evade detection by antivirus software, reports <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/wajam-adware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> at the time. When the OPC announced its findings, Archambault claimed the Canadian user data in question had been destroyed and Wajam had sold its assets to a Chinese company. Over its lifetime, the adware had been installed millions of times, the OPC&#8217;s report said.</p>
<p>In other words, this does not sound like someone who would be opposed to buying some fake reviews!</p>
<p>AmpMe hasn&#8217;t responded to further follow-up questions beyond its original statement, and Apple has not responded to a request for comment.</p>
<p>To date, AmpMe had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/26/adding-a-youtube-integration-ampme-raises-8-million-for-its-app-syncing-phones-into-a-single-speaker-system/">raised</a> $10 million in VC funding, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/amp-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase</a> data.</p>

<p>Sales stand and fall on leads, but attracting prospects and optimally converting them into buyers is an art that many have yet to grasp. About 61% of marketers consider generating traffic and leads their biggest challenge, according to <a href="https://www.stateofinbound.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubspot</a>. Why?</p>
<p>Three problems currently hamper the visibility of a website. First, the digital competition is all optimized for Google’s search engine. Second, new privacy policies in Europe and the U.S. restrict data collection, limiting diverse marketing opportunities. Finally, consumers are showing increasing concern about the benefit-cost calculation of handing out their contact details to businesses.</p>
<p>Facing difficulties doesn’t mean all hope is lost, though. On the contrary: Those who strategically align lead generation with the goals of their potential buyers will gain a significant advantage. The key is building a foot-in-the-door technique for continuous engagement — lead magnets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s explore what lead magnets are and how you can design and implement them effectively to build a strong customer relationship from scratch.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Many companies are quick to overlook that the timing of when a lead magnet is displayed influences user behavior.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>The enticing charm of lead magnets</h2>
<p>In physics, the movements of the +/- poles in magnetic fields generate energy. It’s similar for websites: By incorporating different magnets that trigger various actions, you create a robust environment for sparking a users’ interest. A lead magnet is on-demand content that incentivizes users to provide their contact information (“a sign-up”), so you can engage them in the future. In a survey conducted with 1,000 bloggers, we found that those using lead magnets were 57% more likely to report strong results from their content marketing.</p>
<p>To help you visualize, scroll through <a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/resources/how-passive-liveness-tech-can-prevent-identity-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Innovatrics&#8217; &#8220;How a Liveness Detector Prevents Identity Theft case studies.&#8221;</a> A user interested in a case study can use the embedded contact form to download the whole document for free. As soon as the visitor signs up, Innovatrics can send this email contact a weekly newsletter on new content or other valuable resources about biometric tech.</p>
<p>Today,<a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/lead-nurturing-statistics/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 96% of visitors</a> to your website aren’t ready to buy. Instead, they are either becoming familiar with your brand (awareness stage) or considering your products as one of many options (consideration stage). In these initial phases, you want potential prospects to put their contact details down so that you can engage them with personalized emails in the future. Unfortunately, very few customers just hand over their data like that. This is exactly where alluring magnets enter the equation.</p>
<h2>Essentials for creating high-conversion magnets</h2>
<p>Magnets can be anything that provides additional value, whether benchmark studies, guides, interactive quizzes, short or long-form video content, or anything else. The purpose is exchanging a contact, just like an ethical bribe. To effectively design magnets for several buyer personas and decision stages, you need to ask yourself the following questions first.</p>
<h2>Does the magnet solve a problem?</h2>
<p>If your lead magnet doesn&#8217;t solve a visitor’s problem, or if it doesn’t help them achieve their goal, then your hard work has gone to waste.</p>
<p>To find out if your magnet fits a purpose, you need to listen to your audience. Here, SEO tools come in handy, allowing you to do keyword or search analysis. Browsing through the long- and short-tail keywords with the highest search volume will help you quickly discover what kind of answers potential leads are looking for.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations more than six months after it first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">declared a crackdown</a> on the social media giant in the country.</p>
<p>Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, the director-general of Nigeria’s tech agency, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), made this announcement via a statement today. He was put in charge, as chairman, of the committee (Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement) set up by the Nigerian government to oversee talks between the West African nation and Twitter after the ban.</p>
<p>The chairman said the approval was given following a memo written by the country’s minister of communications and digital economy to the President, Muhammadu Buhari. The statement also revealed that the ban would be lifted immediately by midnight WAT, January 13, 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257021" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) directs me to inform the public that President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, has approved the lifting of the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria effective from 12 am tonight, 13th January 2022,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“The approval was given following a memo written to the President by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Ibrahim. In the Memo, the minister updated and requested the President’s approval for the lifting based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement’s recommendation.”</p>
<p>Abdullahi also noted in the statement that Twitter has agreed to set “a legal entity in Nigeria during the first quarter of 2022.” The establishment of Twitter’s legal entity, according to the statement, is the social media giant’s “first step in demonstrating its long-term commitment to Nigeria.”</p>
<p>It was one of the three requests, out of ten, Nigeria said Twitter, which established its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/twitter-to-set-up-its-first-african-presence-in-ghana/">first African presence in Ghana</a> last April, had failed to meet to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/twitter-ban-in-nigeria-to-be-lifted-if-platform-sets-up-a-local-office-and-pay-taxes-president-says/">reinstate the company’s operations in the country</a> months after the ban. The announcement was made by Nigeria’s information minister Lai Mohammed last August.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to setting up a local office or a legal entity in the country, the other unanswered requests were paying taxes locally and cooperating with the Nigerian government to regulate content and harmful tweets.</p>

<p>It seems the Nigerian government has made some headway with those requests. According to the statement released by the government, Twitter will also appoint a “designated country representative” to hold talks with the Nigerian government when required.</p>
<p>There’s more: “Twitter has agreed to comply with applicable tax obligations on its operations under Nigerian law. Twitter has agreed to enrol Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The portals will serve as a medium for Twitter staff and Nigeria to manage prohibited content that violates Twitter community rules and Nigeria’s law enforcement agencies to present a report if Twitter goes against Nigerian laws.</p>
<p>“Twitter has agreed to act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history on which such legislation has been built and work with the FGN and the broader industry to develop Code of Conduct in line with global best practices, applicable in almost all developed countries,” Abdullahi made this known via a section of the statement.</p>
<p>In June, Nigeria <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">suspended Twitter</a> after the company deleted a controversial post made by the Nigerian president threatening to punish regional secessionists. Mohammed, who made the announcement, cited the persistent use of the platform for “activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence” as the main reason behind the retaliation.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, calls were made by several individuals and corporate bodies to reinstate the platform’s operations while others, like former U.S. President Donald Trump, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/trump-congratulates-nigeria-for-twitter-ban-says-more-countries-should-do-the-same/">praised the move</a>.</p>
<p>In October, President Buhari, during his televised presidential speech on Nigeria’s 61st Independence Day anniversary, said the ban would only be lifted if the social media giant met certain conditions. And in a corresponding emailed statement to TechCrunch, Twitter, via a spokesperson, said discussions with the Nigerian government had been respectful and productive” as it looked forward to “seeing the service restored very soon.”</p>
<p>Three months on, it appears both parties have reached an agreement. TechCrunch reached out to Twitter for comment and to confirm if the company met said conditions. However, we have not received any press time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of more than 80 prominent fact-checking organizations around the world is pressing YouTube to take action against COVID misinformation, which still prevails on the platform now two years into the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an international network of fact-checking organizations, we monitor how lies spread online — and every day, we see that YouTube is one of the major conduits of online disinformation and misinformation worldwide,&#8221; the coalition of fact checkers wrote in an <a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2022/an-open-letter-to-youtubes-ceo-from-the-worlds-fact-checkers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open letter published on Poynter</a>. &#8220;This is a significant concern among our global fact-checking community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The collection of fact-checking organizations that signed the letter spans the globe, including U.S.-based groups like PolitiFact, The Washington Post Fact Checker and Poynter&#8217;s MediaWise, alongside Africa&#8217;s Dubawa and Africa Check, India&#8217;s Fact Crescendo and Factly and many more organizations from countries including Indonesia, Israel and Turkey.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256964" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The group notes that health-related misinformation has long found fertile ground on the video-sharing site, including content encouraging cancer patients to fight their conditions with unscientific treatments.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the last year, we have seen conspiracy groups thriving and collaborating across borders, including an international movement that started in Germany, jumped to Spain and spread through Latin America, all on YouTube,&#8221; the letter states. &#8220;Meanwhile, millions of other users were watching videos in Greek and Arabic that encouraged them to boycott vaccinations or treat their COVID-19 infections with bogus cures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter also highlights the particular dangers of misinformation spreading in non-English language videos. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen called attention to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">parallel concerns on that platform</a>, which also does not invest evenly in content moderation outside of English-speaking countries. The fact-checking group encourages YouTube to &#8220;provide country- and language-specific data, as well as transcription services that work in any language&#8221; to push back against the flow of misinformation in languages beyond English, which the company focuses its moderation methods on.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uCzxpLrfqi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/senate-judiciary-tech-hearing-algorithms-twitter-youtube-facebook/">The next tech hearing targets social media algorithms — and YouTube, for once</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The next tech hearing targets social media algorithms — and YouTube, for once&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/senate-judiciary-tech-hearing-algorithms-twitter-youtube-facebook/embed/#?secret=uCzxpLrfqi" data-secret="uCzxpLrfqi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The fact-checkers don&#8217;t just present problems — they pose solutions as well, pointing out that the company should create far more transparency around its misinformation and disinformation policies and support independent researchers who specialize in those issues. The group also urges YouTube to step up its efforts to debunk misinformation and provide immediate context on-platform, two tactics that could be accomplished by deepening its work with fact-checking organizations.</p>
<p>While Facebook and Twitter have long faced intense public scrutiny for the spread of misinformation on their platforms, YouTube often manages to fly under the radar. Its recommendation algorithm has played an active role in promoting dangerous claims in recent years, but because like TikTok the platform is video and not text-based it&#8217;s generally more difficult for researchers to study and lawmakers holding tech accountability hearings to wrap their heads around.</p>
<p>&#8220;YouTube is allowing its platform to be weaponized by unscrupulous actors to manipulate and exploit others, and to organize and fundraise themselves,&#8221; the group wrote. &#8220;Current measures are proving insufficient.&#8221;</p>

I fall into the latter camp, but I’m not talking about cartoon worlds filled with avatars like many are pitching.</p>
<p>Instead, I believe the <em>true metaverse</em> – the one that will change society &#8212; will be an <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/12/28/future-augmented-reality-will-inherit-the-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">augmentation layer on the real world,</a> and within 10 years it will be the foundation of our lives, impacting everything from shopping and socializing to business and education.</p>
<p>I also believe that a corporate-controlled metaverse is dangerous to society and requires aggressive regulation. That’s because the platform providers will be able to <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/metaverse-augmented-reality-danger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manipulate consumers</a> in ways that will make social media seem quaint. Most people resonate with concerns around data collection and privacy, but they overlook what will be the most dangerous technology in the metaverse – artificial intelligence.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256343" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

			The most dangerous part of the metaverse: agenda-driven artificial agents that look and act like other users but are actually simulated personas controlled by AI.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>In fact, if you ask people to name the core technologies of the metaverse, they’ll usually focus on the eyewear and maybe mention the graphics engines, 5G or even blockchain. But those are just the nuts and bolts of our immersive future – the technology that will pull the strings in the metaverse, creating (and manipulating) our experience, is AI.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence will be just as important to our virtual future as the headsets that get all the attention. And the most dangerous part of the metaverse will be agenda-driven artificial agents that look and act like other users but are actually simulated personas controlled by AI. They will engage us in “conversational manipulation,” targeting us on behalf of paying advertisers without us realizing they aren’t real.</p>
<p>This is especially dangerous when the AI algorithms have access to data about our personal interests and beliefs, habits and temperament, all while monitoring our emotional state by reading our facial expressions and vocal inflections.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you think targeted ads in social media are manipulative, it’s nothing compared to the conversational agents that will engage us in the metaverse. They will pitch us more skillfully than any human salesperson, and it won’t just be to sell us gadgets – they will push political propaganda and targeted misinformation on behalf of the highest bidder.</p>
<p>And because these AI agents will look and sound like anyone else in the metaverse, our natural skepticism to advertising will not protect us. For these reasons, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/12/04/the-metaverse-needs-aggressive-regulation/">we need to regulate</a> AI-driven conversational agents, especially when they have access to our facial and vocal affects, enabling our emotions to be used against us in real time.</p>
<p>If we don’t regulate this, ads in the form of AI-driven avatars will sense when you’re skeptical and change tactics in mid-sentence, quickly zeroing in on the words and images that impact <em>you</em> personally. As I <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence-isnt-intelligence-manipulating-humanity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in 2016</a>, if an AI can learn to beat the world’s best chess and Go players, learning to sway consumers to buy things (and believe things) that aren’t in our interest is child’s play.</p>
<p>But of all the technologies headed our way, it’s what I call the “elf” that will be the most powerful and subtle form of coercion in the metaverse. These “electronic life facilitators” are the natural evolution of digital assistants like Siri and Alexa, but they won’t be disembodied voices in the metaverse. They’ll be anthropomorphized personas customized for each consumer.</p>
<p>The platform providers will market these AI agents as virtual life coaches and they will be persistent throughout your day as you navigate the metaverse. And because the metaverse will ultimately be an augmentation layer upon the real world, these digital elves will be with you everywhere, whether you are shopping or working or just hanging out.</p>
<p>And just like the marketing agents described above, these elves will have access to your facial expressions and vocal inflections along with a detailed data history of your life, nudging you toward actions and activities, products and services, even political views.</p>
<p>And no, they won’t be like the crude chatbots of today, but embodied characters you’ll come to think of as trusted figures in your life – a mix between a familiar friend, helpful adviser and caring therapist. And yet, your elf will know you in ways no friend ever could, for it will be monitoring all aspects of your life down to your blood pressure and respiration rate (via your trusty smartwatch).</p>
<p>Yes, this sounds creepy, which is why platform providers will make them cute and non-threatening, with innocent features and mannerisms that seem more like a magical character in your own “life adventure” than a human-sized assistant following you around. This is why I use the word “elf” to describe them, as they might appear to you as a fairy hovering over your shoulder or maybe a gremlin or alien – a small anthropomorphic character that can whisper in your ear or fly out in front of you to draw attention to things in your augmented world it wants you to focus on.</p>
<p>This is where it gets especially dangerous &#8212; without regulation, these life facilitators will be hijacked by paying advertisers, targeting you with greater skill and precision than anything on today’s social media. And unlike ads of today, these intelligent agents will be following you around, guiding you through your day, and doing it with a cute smile or giggly laugh.</p>
<p>To help convey what this will be like, both positive and negative, I’ve written a short narrative, <a href="https://medium.com/predict/metaverse-2030-ee59e4d4010d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaverse 2030</a>, that portrays how AI will drive our immersive lives by 2030 and beyond.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the technologies of VR, AR and AI have the potential to enrich and improve our lives. But when combined, these innovations become especially dangerous, as they all have one powerful trait in common – they can make us believe that computer-generated content is authentic, even if it’s an agenda-driven fabrication. It’s this powerful ability for digital deception that should make us fear an AI-enabled metaverse, especially when controlled by powerful corporations that sell third-party access to its users for promotional purposes.</p>
<p>I raise these concerns in the hope that consumers and industry leaders will push for <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/metaverse-dystopia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meaningful regulation</a> before the problems become so ingrained in the technology of the metaverse that they’re impossible to undo.</p>

Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chair-rosenworcel-circulates-new-data-breach-reporting-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">shared</a> a rulemaking proposal that would introduce stricter requirements for data breach reporting. Most notably, the new rules would require notifications for customers affected by &#8220;inadvertent&#8221; breaches — companies that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-power-apps-data-exposed-report-covid-19-api-configuration-165453736.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">leave data exposed</a> would have to be just as communicative as victims of cyberattacks.</p>
<p>The requirements would also scrap a mandatory one-week waiting period for notifying customers. Carriers, meanwhile, would have to disclose reportable breaches to the FCC in addition to the FBI and Secret Service.</p>
<p>Rosenworcel argued the tougher rules were necessary to account for the &#8220;evolving nature&#8221; of breaches and the risks they posed to victims. People ought to be protected against larger and more frequent incidents, the FCC chair said — that is, regulations need to catch up with reality.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257024" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FCC didn&#8217;t say when the proposal might come up for a vote, although the FCC&#8217;s next open meeting is slated for January 27th. There&#8217;s no guarantee the Commission will greenlight the new requirements. It won&#8217;t be surprising if the rulemaking moves forward, however. While companies are now more likely to disclose breaches, there have been multiple high-profile incidents where those firms took too long to alert customers or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-ny-attorney-general-sues-dunkin-cyberattacks.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">didn&#8217;t notify them at all</a>. The new measures could cut that wait time, giving people a better chance of securing their data and preventing fraud.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Justworks' IPO delay indicates that the enthusiasm gap between private markets and their public analog is wide.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Justworks, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/justworks-files-to-take-its-smb-focused-hr-themed-saas-business-public/">venture-backed software startup focused on the HR market</a> for small and medium-sized businesses, announced earlier today that it would delay its IPO. In a statement to TechCrunch, Justworks said that it &#8220;decided to delay its IPO due to market conditions at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>An IPO delay is just that, a public debut pushed back. But Justworks&#8217; decision to put its public offering on temporary hiatus comes on the heels of rapid declines in the value of recent technology debuts employing traditional IPOs, SPACs and direct listings. Even more, Justworks&#8217; now-delayed IPO follows a selloff in the value of software and technology shares more generally.</p>
<p>Is there something bigger afoot than one company&#8217;s stumble?</p>
<h2>Reading the tea leaves</h2>
<p>The Justworks IPO delay is the latest data point in what could be a worsening exit market for unicorns. Otherwise, we wouldn&#8217;t make a fuss.</p>
<p>Why? Sometimes when a private company wants to go public, it finds that public-market investors are not willing to buy its shares at the price it had in mind. By taking more time, the IPO hopeful can tidy up its numbers, perhaps answering some of its critics head-on with results or business tweaks. Once the company has tuned its performance and image, it can try to float once again.</p>
<p>Such a private-public disconnect can stem from a gap between a company&#8217;s results, what it thinks they are worth, and the public market&#8217;s view of the particular firm in question. Alternatively, a similar disconnect can arise from the public markets simply being on a different page regarding valuations than the private markets. Our read of the Justworks news is that it&#8217;s likely dealing with at least the latter issue, and perhaps the former as well.</p>
<p>The possibility of a gap between how private investors value growth-focused tech companies and how the stock market values those companies matters because of how many richly valued tech startups need to find an exit in the coming year. In bad news for those companies, a number of factors likely made Justworks&#8217; IPO timing difficult, hinting that other unicorns could also struggle to exit in today&#8217;s investing climate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.dormroomfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dorm Room Fund</a>, a venture capital operation that launched to invest in student-led startups, has raised a new $10.4 million fund, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1899115/000090571822000094/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per SEC filings.</a> The filing marks Dorm Room Fund’s largest fund to date, and its first that appears to include investors beyond First Round Capital, the firm that first launched the student-focused operation in 2012. The SEC filing indicates that the fundraise is still ongoing. Both firms declined to comment.</p>
<p>Dorm Room Fund’s original vision was tied to First Round Capital’s bet that early-stage investing could be led by students, for students. In 2012, First Round Capital thus allocated a portion of its assets under management &#8212; a  $3 million capital pool &#8212; to be managed by a group of students. Today, Dorm Room Fund continues to still only invest in companies where at least one person on the founding team is a student or recent graduate.</p>
<p>Dorm Room Fund has made 326 investments to date, in startups such as Brooklinen and Snackpass &#8212; as well as venture firm Harlem Capital Partners. On its website, the operation says it writes $40,000 SAFE notes into the startups it backs &#8212; and has teams in New York City, San Francisco, Boston and Philadelphia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256996" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While the operation&#8217;s focus is largely in the United States, we have some signals its checkwriting focus may be broadening: Dorm Room Fund’s latest investment, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dorm-room-fund/recent_investments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per Crunchbase</a>, was in a pre-seed round for Alima, a Mexico City-based company that wants to make product procurement easier for businesses.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0qj8Eca1iB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/18/more-than-another-check-founders-need-activation-energy/">More than another check, founders need activation energy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More than another check, founders need activation energy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/18/more-than-another-check-founders-need-activation-energy/embed/#?secret=0qj8Eca1iB" data-secret="0qj8Eca1iB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Dorm Room Fund, which had been noticeably quieter in its investment activity over the past few years, fresh capital could give a boost to its student-focused operations. As the larger investing world gets more competitive, investors are incentivized to find talent sooner and sooner &#8212; either through in-house accelerators, non-dilutive programming or, in this case, a carved out microfund explicitly for aspiring entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The strategy may feel especially relevant today, but there is precedent. Similar to Dorm Room Fund, General Catalyst launched Rough Draft Ventures as a play to get more access to student networks. Contrary Capital, another student-focused venture capital firm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/contrary-capitals-20m-fund-ii-is-all-about-community-first-investments/">recently announced a $20 million fund</a> &#8212; its second investment vehicle to date. In 2019, First Round made another move in favor of early talent: it supported the Graduate Fund, a pre-seed fund that targets recent graduates of undergraduate or master’s programs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/new-pre-seed-fund-powered-by-first-round-capital-will-target-recent-graduates/">but that operates independently. </a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dorm Room Fund appears to have been gearing up for a refresh of sorts. In 2018, the team launched a CRM for founders raising a seed round, but a year later the firm’s CEO Rei Wang left their post to launch The Grand, a learning and development platform to help people navigate change. That same year, <a href="https://dormroomfund.medium.com/announcing-the-new-ceo-and-coo-of-dorm-room-fund-460e66eb6351" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the team hired Molly Fowler,</a> who previously worked in politics and urban planning, to be the new chief executive. It also brought on Chauncey Hamilton as its inaugural COO, who was previously the chief of staff to First Round partner Rob Hayes. With new leadership, Dorm Room Fund has seemed to convince a cadre of LPs that its longtime focus deserves fresh capital.</p>

Another company, Brainlab, wants to make its Mixed Reality Viewer software available on Magic Leap 2.</p>
<p>That Magic Leap is making its latest wearable available to digital healthcare startups first isn’t surprising; CEO Peggy Johnson said as much would happen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/magic-leap-2-release-date-peggy-johnson-interview-160326037.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><ins>last April</ins></a>. &#8220;Augmented reality may transform healthcare more than any other industry, at least in the near term,&#8221; she said at the time, noting also that the company would focus on enterprise customers at launch.</p>
<p>Magic Leap has famously struggled since its emergence as one of Silicon Valley’s most hyped startups. In 2019, it came out that the company had reportedly only sold <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-06-magic-leap-6000-headsets-sold-report.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>6,000</ins></a> units of its $2,300 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-magic-leap-hands-on-one-creator-edition-mixed-reality.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>Magic Leap One Creator Edition</ins></a>headset through the first six months that the device was available. It subsequently spent months laying off employees before a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/magic-leap-raises-350-million-puts-layoffs-on-hold-034824726.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>$350 million investment</ins></a> gave it a new shot of life.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256973" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMwMwcRkMyaATka8BRCt76S9VdoYfJ2YpVe_Z5mS2iWLyCMVnJ0GH2VoV88NhEHXb9uunkyeLxpMtQWSUFgBKO5dw6R9uW-z7TOscctAmyzT7hQ_4hzSb6s3Emuo_ckgtySx8gfyDoJOkdxRubNNPK8RVmjlx8OJXbTqalkn1pPE">Apple</a> has fixed a security vulnerability in iOS and iPadOS that could be exploited via HomeKit to launch persistent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ddos/">denial of service</a> (DoS) attacks.</p>
<p>The technology giant<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213043" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> released iOS 15.2.1 and iPadOS 15.2.1</a> on Wednesday to patch the so-called &#8220;doorLock&#8221; flaw, which was disclosed earlier this month by <a href="https://trevorspiniolas.com/doorlock/doorlock.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security researcher Trevor Spiniolas</a>. The bug affects iPhones and iPads running iOS 14.7 through iOS 15.2 and is triggered via HomeKit, Apple&#8217;s smart home platform that lets Apple users configure, communicate with and control their smart home devices.</p>
<p>To exploit the bug, an attacker would need to change the name of a HomeKit device to a string larger than 500,000 characters. When that string loads on a user&#8217;s iPhone or iPad, the device&#8217;s software would be thrown into a denial of service (DoS) state, requiring a forced-reset to unfreeze. But once the device reboots and the user signs back into the iCloud account linked to HomeKit, the bug is triggered again.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256928" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Even if a user doesn’t have any devices added on HomeKit, an attacker could create a spoof Home network and trick a user into joining via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> email. Worse, Spiniolas warned that attackers could leverage the doorLock vulnerability to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attacks against iOS users, locking devices into an unusable state and demanding a ransom payment to set the HomeKit device back to a safe string length.</p>
<p>Spiniolas said that Apple pledged to fix the issue in a security update last year, but this was pushed back until &#8220;early 2022,&#8221; prompting Spiniolas to disclose the bug fearing the delay poses a &#8220;serious risk&#8221; to users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite them confirming the security issue and me urging them many times over the past four months to take the matter seriously, little was done,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Status updates on the matter were rare and featured exceptionally few details, even though I asked for them frequently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple’s lack of transparency is not only frustrating to security researchers who often work for free, it poses a risk to the millions of people who use Apple products in their day-to-day lives by reducing Apple’s accountability on security matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The update can be downloaded now and is available for the iPhone 6s and later, all iPad Pro models, iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad mini 4 and later and iPod touch (7th generation).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.homevalet.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HomeValet</a>, a D.C. Metro area-based startup that has developed a temperature-controlled <a href="https://www.homevalet.co/smart-box/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart box</a> for grocery deliveries, is now releasing its smart home product to the public and expanding its partnership with Walmart. The company had previously piloted its Smart Box with Walmart in 2021 as a way for grocery delivery customers to keep their fresh and frozen items cold while also ensuring their deliveries remained secure until they could retrieve them.</p>
<p>Now, the Smart Box will be offered to Walmart&#8217;s InHome grocery delivery subscribers in select markets starting this month, the company says. It will also be offered to general consumers who can <a href="https://www.homevalet.co/preorder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preorder</a> the box with a down payment of $50. The full product costs $499 for InHome subscribers &#8212; so it&#8217;s a bit of an investment (financing is available through Affirm).</p>
<p>However, the box could make sense for people who want the convenience of placing grocery orders online but aren&#8217;t able to be at home when those items are delivered.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256829" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>This is one of the major roadblocks to grocery delivery adoption among consumers. Because fresh and frozen items need to be put away fairly soon after delivery, many people opt to order groceries via curbside pickup or just shop the stores as usual. The issue also complicates the logistics of grocery delivery, as shoppers want their groceries delivered at certain times of the day, when they can be home &#8212; like after work or on weekends. This leads to ebbs and flows of delivery requests throughout the days and weeks, instead of allowing the retailer itself to determine the best time to route and deliver certain orders.</p>
<p>Walmart&#8217;s solution to this problem, so far, has been its InHome delivery service. This grocery subscription service, which the retailer said last week<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/walmart-to-expand-inhome-grocery-delivery-to-30-million-u-s-households-in-2022/"> would be available to 30 million households by year-end,</a> allows Walmart employees to enter the home through a smart lock system and put groceries away in the fridge and freezer on the customer&#8217;s behalf. These deliveries are recorded via vest-worn cameras for security purposes.</p>
<p>But not all customers will be comfortable with having unknown people enter their homes. (Or they can&#8217;t allow this for some other reason &#8212; like having a big dog who doesn&#8217;t like visitors, perhaps!)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is where the HomeValet Smart Box system could come in. Instead of having the Walmart delivery staff enter their home, the delivery driver would be able to access the smart box and place the groceries inside.</p>

<p>The HomeValet system itself is an internet-connected box with an uncooled side for pantry and other non-grocery items, as well as a temperature-controlled cooler side with sections for both fresh and frozen items. (The sections are configurable by the end user, too.)</p>
<p>The Smart Box also ships with a companion mobile app that alerts you to deliveries and records video of the courier placing your order inside the box via its included Sony IMX322 camera, which records in 1080p.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256923" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256923" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2256923" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/App_holding-phone-mock.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/App_holding-phone-mock.jpeg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/App_holding-phone-mock.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/App_holding-phone-mock.jpeg?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/App_holding-phone-mock.jpeg?resize=768,572 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/App_holding-phone-mock.jpeg?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/App_holding-phone-mock.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256923" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HomeValet</p></div></p>
<p>From the app, customers are able to lock and unlock the box, as needed, and adjust the temperature remotely. The box can also automatically unlock for deliveries before they arrive if integrated with a supported retailer&#8217;s system, like Walmart&#8217;s InHome. (The app requires a paid subscription.)</p>
<p>The Smart Box is powered by a standard 110-volt outlet and can be anchored to the ground if desired. The box is a sizable 120 pounds and sports dimensions of 50.86&#8243; x 25.37&#8243; x 26.56&#8243;. (An earlier version had a UV light for sanitization but the current system&#8217;s specs don&#8217;t mention this feature.)</p>
<p>HomeValet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/walmart-partners-with-smart-box-maker-homevalet-for-grocery-delivery-pilot/">piloted its Smart Box system with Walmart</a> customers in May 2021 in Northwest Arkansas and ran additional tests in parts of Indiana, Minnesota and in the D.C. Metro area. The company is now making the system available to InHome shoppers first.</p>
<p>Walmart InHome customers serviced by stores in Florida &#8212; a smart place to start, given the climate &#8212; will be getting the first shipments of the box in February 2022. InHome customers can purchase the box at the launch price of $499 plus a $10/mo subscription service, with six months free included.</p>
<p>The box will then ship to other preorder customers in August 2022 in limited quantities, followed by expanded shipments in November 2022. These customers will pay a different MSRP, to be released at a later date.</p>
