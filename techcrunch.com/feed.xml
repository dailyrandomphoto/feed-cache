										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ethyca.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethyca</a>, the privacy-by-design technology startup that has built a unique set of APIs, detection tools and analytics to make it easier for organizations to adhere to data privacy policies like GDPR, is taking a couple of big steps today as it gets deeper into the business of data protection.</p>
<p>First, the New York-based startup is open sourcing a set of developer tools it has built called <a href="https://ethyca.com/fides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fides</a>, so that developers can build privacy tools and monitoring mechanisms directly into their codebases. Second, it has picked up an additional $7.5 million in funding so that it can continue developing and commercializing its proprietary tools, specifically APIs to make it easier for those building or monitoring privacy compliance to do so.</p>
<p>The funding, an extension to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/ethyca-raises-13-5m-to-help-businesses-automate-data-privacy-and-compliance/">June 2020 Series A</a> of $13.5 million, is coming from existing investors &#8212; specifically Lee Fixel, IA Ventures , Lachy Groom’s LGF and Table Management (Bill Ackman), and it brings that Series A to $21 million. Ethyca has raised $27.5 million to date, and has amassed dozens of customers that include the likes of Away, IDEO and InVision.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2228430" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Founder and CEO Cillian Kieran (pictured, right) said that Fides was actually the motivation for starting Ethyca in the first place. His thesis in 2018 was that privacy was becoming a more critical and essential aspect of building and running digital services &#8212; not only because data protection regulations and the demands of cybersecurity challenges were increasingly demanding it, but so too were the users of those services who were becoming more aware of how their data was being used (and sometimes abused).</p>
<p>Added to that, of course, is the role of the developer, or the organization itself, in the equation. Many believe that to get data protection right, you have to build it in from the very beginning, both as a priority and as an actual technical part of how a system works &#8212; a concept that people often refer to as &#8220;privacy by design.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Ethyca&#8217;s APIs are aimed at essentially building versions of those tools to make it easier to monitor and account for privacy within an existing workflow, Fides gets to the heart of it all for those who are building, to program it in from the start. Fides itself is described by Ethyca as an open source definition and configuration language for describing privacy constructs in data and software systems. It is being released initially with two OSS tools, Fides Ops and Fides Control, that respectively cover orchestration of privacy rights in an organization&#8217;s data infrastructure, and the validation of privacy rules in CI/CD workflows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Essentially, we have inserted privacy into the CI/CD pipeline,&#8221; Kieran said. He likens how it works to companies like Snyk, which is used by developers and starts looking for security loopholes and vulnerabilities before code is ever put into production. &#8220;Fides can do the same with the privacy.&#8221; Snyk, I&#8217;ll point out, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/snyk-snags-another-530m-as-valuation-rises-to-8-4b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skyrocketed in valuation</a> in recent times, a sign of the high priority placed right now on addressing security and data protection at the devops level.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the case of Fides, the idea is that the toolkit will, for example, be able to detect when code is calling in user behavior, data and location at the same time. If the business doesn&#8217;t permit that, Fides will flag the relevant part of the code to fix it before it goes into production. It can also be used to automate data rights requests, such as when a person asks to be unsubscribed or have their data deleted from a system &#8212; something that typically can take many hours or weeks to carry out manually (as it often is).</p>
<p>Ethyca&#8217;s Pro (paid) tools already integrate with some 700 apps to monitor for data protection and privacy policy alignment, and in addition to the many private companies on its books, works with a number of publicly-traded larger enterprises and technology companies that it declines to name public (but believe me when I say&#8230; they are big and exactly the kinds of companies that have needed to hone in on better privacy and data protection measures).</p>
<p>Fides meanwhile already integrates with database platforms like Amazon&#8217;s DynamoDB and Redshift, Snowflake, Databricks, MongoDB, MariaDB, Microsoft&#8217;s SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, and it has signed on Slack and Github as supporters of its open source community.</p>
<p>The funding will let Ethyca continue to hire to build out that commercial business while continuing to contribute to what it believes needs to be at the heart of how privacy is built in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our investment and ongoing excitement in Ethyca reflects the need for a developer-first approach to privacy and compliance as code,&#8221; said IA Ventures’ Brad Gillespie, in a statement. &#8220;The release of Fides is the culmination of three years of work for the team and a first step towards defining a much-needed open standard for privacy. With Fides, Ethyca shows they’re thinking proactively about how best to solve the higher-order challenges that will shape data privacy discussions over the coming decade. We&#8217;re thrilled to support them in their ambitious plan to shift privacy left into the Software Development Life Cycle through open-source developer tools.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies deal with a growing array of privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA, they are looking for solutions that help them not only understand their customers better, but also help them comply with those laws in a less labor-intensive way.</p>
<p><a href="https://blotout.io/">Bloutout</a>, a member of the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/blotout">Y Combinator winter 2021</a> cohort, announced a $3 million seed round today to help solve that problem. The early stage startup has built a customer data platform (CDP) from the ground up with a focus on data privacy. The round was led by First Rays Venture Partners with participation from Y Combinator, Pascal Capital, Launchpad Capital and FuboTV co-founder Sung Ho Choi.</p>
<p>Company founder and CEO ​​Mandar Shinde says that companies need access to the full breadth of customer data to both understand them better and to comply with a growing number of privacy laws. He says that many of today&#8217;s tools miss key data, and Blotout has been designed specifically for those requirements.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228397" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Unlike most of the companies that analyze data post collection, we are actually enabling the pipe at collection time and integrating all of the privacy stack into the collection itself. So you have consent and collection [built] into your own infrastructure,&#8221; Shinde explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228406" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228406" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228406" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?w=680" alt="TC - Blotout Product Screenshot" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg 3841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228406" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blotout</p></div></p>
<p>The company lets you install their solution on your cloud of choice such as Amazon, Microsoft or Google and then capture the data as it comes into your system, using Blotout to collect the permissions and comply with each law, while giving the customer full control of the data.</p>
<p>Alok Nandan, Partner at lead investor First Rays Ventures says that Blotout&#8217;s approach to build a new compliance solution from the ground up on top of a CDP was what attracted his firm to invest in the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people talk about first party data, but to execute first party data you need to build the whole Martech stack from the ground up. People are kind of band-aiding it together and saying it&#8217;s first party data by doing post facto data processing, but the way to build it is in a clean slate way, which is what Blotout has done,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company currently has 30 employees spread out across the Bay Area, India and Europe. COO Matthew Boulos says he is growing the team pretty aggressively because it&#8217;s an ambitious product and will require lots of data engineering talent. Boulos acknowledges that it&#8217;s a challenge to build a diverse team in this hiring environment, but he says being a worldwide team helps in this regard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to pretend that we solved all of this, but one of the things that we are learning is how to not only bring in that diverse talent, but also how to create an environment that makes it possible for people to function as they are, where they don&#8217;t need to sort of comport themselves to something that may not be, but to be authentic…,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company founders went through Y Combinator last winter, and even though they both have industry experience, they felt it would give them a leg up on financing, and as today&#8217;s announcement bears out, that seems to have worked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-based Neuron Mobility, an e-scooter-sharing company, is updating its N3 scooters with a new operating system and additional on-board sensors that will help it detect and correct dangerous or inconsiderate riding behavior. The company will be trialing about 1,500 upgraded scooters in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom over the next six months.</p>
<p>Neuron&#8217;s new scooters will rely on high-accuracy location technology and rapid geo-fence detection in order to correct or warn users of unsafe behaviors, like aggressive swerving, skidding, curb jumping, tandem riding and sidewalk riding. The new sensors and IoT layer allow the scooter to speak to the rider in many different languages and guide them toward correcting their own behavior, or it might give riders a safety evaluation after a ride and send educational materials on how to ride safely via email. In extreme circumstances, the scooter will be able to simply slow riders to a stop, combined with an audio message like: &#8220;You are leaving the service area, head back or power will be cut off.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the long-term, all riders will get an individual safety rating, which Neuron hopes will incentivize good behavior, target certain riders for safety training and ban repeat offenders.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;But what is the actual impact of this technology layer in a real-world setting, in the hands of real users?&#8221; Zachary Wang, CEO of Neuron, told TechCrunch. &#8220;That is the key focus of the trial. We want to study across thousands of scooters and different geographical areas, working with different city councils to really understand where do we want to draw the line? How should we implement this technology in a way that best suits the needs of cities?&#8221;</p>
<p>Neuron is the latest e-scooter operator to implement this type of rider assistance system. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/bird-vehicles-can-now-accurately-detect-sidewalk-riding-and-slow-riders-to-a-stop/">Bird recently launched its new location-based sidewalk riding detection technology</a> in hundreds of scooters in Milwaukee and San Diego. Over the summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/superpedestrian-acquires-navmatic-to-detect-and-control-unsafe-e-scooter-rider-behavior/">Superpedestrian acquired Navmatic</a> so it could implement the company&#8217;s high-accuracy positioning software in order to detect dangerous riding behavior and stop it in real time.</p>
<p>Companies like Spin, Voi and Helbiz are also trialing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">scooter advanced driver assistance systems</a> (ADAS), but their systems use cameras attached to the vehicles, along with other sensors, to come to similar conclusions about a rider&#8217;s behavior or parking.</p>
<p>While Neuron is, admittedly, a little late to the party, it is probably the only company publicly introducing this kind of tech that has developed it purely in-house. Bird&#8217;s location accuracy is made possible through a partnership with u-blox, a Swiss company that produces wireless semiconductors and high-precision positioning modules; Spin and Helbiz are working with Drover AI, and Voi with Luna, on their respective computer vision modules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For accurate location tracking, Neuron is implementing a multi-constellation, multi-band global navigation satellite system (GNSS), which uses radio from satellites to provide highly precise geo-spatial positioning. New accelerometers and six-axis gyroscope sensors help detect how fast the vehicle is traveling, what the acceleration is like, what angles the vehicle is turning on and whether or not it&#8217;s going up or down a slope &#8212; all of which help the vehicle determine if the rider is driving aggressively, as well as work in tandem with the positioning software to get an even more accurate location.</p>
<p>The rapid geo-fence detection takes in all of this data and processes it locally and quickly using edge computing, rather than cloud computing, which Neuron says results in 10 centimeter-level accuracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working over the past 12 months to bundle all this technology together, because to make one work, we need a lot of additional sensors, and we need to be able to know the position before we can process the information locally,&#8221; said Wang.</p>
<p>While all of Neuron&#8217;s new technological capabilities are present at the same time on each scooter, not all features will be tested simultaneously. For example, in cities like Ottawa, e-scooters are only allowed to ride on the road or bike paths, so it&#8217;s the sidewalk detection technology that will be featured heavily there. Meanwhile in Australia, riders must ride on the sidewalk, so Neuron will trial its high-accuracy location technology as it relates to designated parking locations, according to the company.</p>
<p>Neuron is currently present in 23 markets throughout Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and Korea. The trial will be taking place in<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ottawa in Canada, Brisbane and Darwin in Australia, and Slough in the United Kingdom.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Merge, an integrations platform that focuses on B2B use cases, today announced that it has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Lee Fixel at Addition, with participation from existing investor NEA, which led the company&#8217;s $4.5 million seed round, and a number of angel investors. In addition to the new funding, the company also today announced partnerships with HR providers BambooHR and application tracking system Lever.</p>
<p>Merge co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shensiding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shensi Ding</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilfeig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gil Feig</a> told me that when the company announced its seed funding, there were about 100 companies on its platform. Today that number is 600 and Ding noted that this now includes a number of public companies. As is often the case with seed-stage startups, Merge spent a lot of the last few months building the right tools for these larger customers, including single-tenant hosting for those enterprises that need those kinds of assurances. But the team also added features like CSV uploads, SAML SSO custom field mapping, more detailed logging and more.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s vision is to become the de facto standard for B2B integrations. Right now, its focus is on HR, payroll, accounting and recruiting, but that&#8217;s mainly because the team is still small and had to focus its efforts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228173" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>&#8220;We are planning on crossing many categories and not only focusing on a few,&#8221; Ding said. &#8220;This was just the beginning. But to be honest, one thing that Gil and I previously experienced at our previous companies was that those broad integrations companies are too broad. They don&#8217;t really cover enough players in a space where if you have a customer who&#8217;s on one platform, sure, that one customer might be covered, but then the 10 other customers you&#8217;re trying to onboard probably aren&#8217;t covered by those broad integrations platforms. Having comprehensive coverage in existing categories has been really huge for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Feig also stressed, Merge doesn&#8217;t see itself as a workflow automation platform that wants to compete with Microsoft&#8217;s Power Automate and similar platforms. Instead, the team is positioning Merge as a tool to help B2B companies build customer-facing integrations. The average B2B company needs to integrate with dozens of vendors &#8212; and those integrations can often be brittle. Merge offers them a unified API that can then power all of these user-facing experiences.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing these bigger companies work on or acquire products like <a href="https://boomi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dell Boomi</a> and that sort of thing,&#8221; Feig explained. &#8220;They really are still workflow automation, which are mainly beneficial for internal use cases, like &#8216;when something happened on Salesforce, notify the sales team on Slack.&#8217; The benefit overall of what we&#8217;re doing is the fact that we&#8217;re unified, the fact that you get 20, 30, 40 API&#8217;s all unified into a single format. That one build produces all of those integrations whereas those classic workflow products that more and more people are rolling out still require you to build one-by-one. They just move the implementation from code to having to drag and drop blocks in a UI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, Merge features about 50 integrations. Unsurprisingly, the team plans to use the new funding to expand into more categories and to expand its engineering and sales team to do so.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Merge continues to position itself as a leader in customer-facing integrations in the B2B space,” said Lee Fixel, founder of Addition. “Their track record to date demonstrates they’re solving the right problem with the right product, and we’re excited to support the company on its continued growth trajectory.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish freight technology company Einride announced the launch of its operations in the United States. On Thursday, the company will officially begin testing its transport solutions – like its autonomous &#8216;pods,&#8217; electric trucks and &#8216;Saga&#8217; operating system – with partners like GE Appliances (GEA), Bridgestone and Oatly.</p>
<p>The company also announced that it would introduce a U.S. version of its pod which has been adapted to suit American road conditions and regulations, as well as a flatbed pod, a module vehicle built to accommodate a range of shipping needs, such as transporting containers from shipyards.</p>
<p>Einride operates one of Europe&#8217;s largest fleets of electric trucks. Its autonomous pods, which are built without a front cab, and thus, without room for a human safety operator, are also electric. Some of the other major players in the autonomous freight game, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/the-station-a-tesla-nhtsa-fight-brews-catching-up-with-kodiak-and-how-la-is-prepping-for-air-taxis/">Kodiak Robotics</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/tusimples-self-driving-truck-network-takes-shape-with-ryder-partnership/">TuSimple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">Waymo</a>, are not necessarily pursuing an electric-only approach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228284" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Between 7% and 8% of global CO2 emissions come from heavy road freight transport,&#8221; Robert Falck, CEO and founder of Einride, told TechCrunch. &#8220;One of the drivers for starting Einride is that I&#8217;m very worried that by optimizing and making road freight transport autonomous, but based on diesel, it&#8217;s likely that we will actually increase emissions because it would become that much cheaper to operate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Einride&#8217;s partnership wth GEA will involve the deployment of seven autonomous and electric trucks that will run at at the company&#8217;s 750 acre campus in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as other locations in Tennessee and Georgia. The company predicts GEA will save 870 tons of carbon dioxide emissions within the first year of launch, and the plan is to expand the partnership with GEA rapidly over the course of the next few years with additional trucks to be added.</p>
<p>The Bridgestone collaboration is more of a technology partnership aimed at co-creating sustainable mobility solutions for electrified and autonomous Class 8 vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaboration allows Einride to collect new layers of safety and efficiency-related data from Bridgestone’s smart-sensing tires, while enabling Bridgestone to integrate its advanced mobility technologies into Einride’s onboard vehicle platforms,&#8221; a spokesperson for Einride told TechCrunch. &#8220;</span>Einride will supply connected electric trucks and digital services under a subscription agreement to Bridgestone for its U.S. shipping logistics network, with the aim of electrifying the majority of Bridgestone’s landside transport needs by 2025.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Oatly, an oat milk company, is already a partner of Einride&#8217;s in Europe and is now expanding that partnership to the U.S. Einride wouldn&#8217;t share many details about the American expansion, but Falck said that it will look similar to how Einride digitalized and electrified Oatly&#8217;s European transportation beginning in 2020. In Europe, and presumably in the U.S., Einride provides Oatly with electric trucks and its Saga platform, which has helped the company go electric quicker and reduce its carbon footprint by 87% on selected routes, according to Einride.</p>
<p>Einride&#8217;s U.S. launch also coincides with an update to the Saga platform. Saga, which comes from the old Norse word for &#8220;all knowing,&#8221; is the IoT system that runs through Einride&#8217;s electric trucks and pods. It&#8217;s how the company optimizes routes and runs a large electric fleet, and Einride hopes it will become a sort of universal operating system that will help transform the heavy freight industry and empower companies to electrify their fleets.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The current trucking industry is extremely fragmented and not very coordinated,&#8221; said Falck. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to go electric, but it&#8217;s not about range and it&#8217;s not about how much you can actually deploy electric. If we use our Saga platform and our operating system, you can actually electrify up to 40% of the U.S. road freight transport system with a competitive business case using existing technology. It&#8217;s more about deploying new way of thinking rather than just improving the hardware.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Because Einride&#8217;s pods don&#8217;t employ on-board safety operators, the company has also employed a new way of thinking about how to achieve Level 4 autonomy. (Level 4 means the vehicles can handle all aspects of driving in <em>certain</em> conditions without human intervention, according to SAE International.)</p>
<p>Einride&#8217;s entire system has to be built differently due to the lack of a safety driver, says Falck. Other companies collect miles with a human operator in the front seat, but Falck calls what Einride has done the &#8220;toddler approach,&#8221; where it teaches the vehicle to first crawl, then walk slowly until it gradually increases its capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started with traditional Level 4 and then increased usability in applications, combining autonomous with the remote driver ability, so that gives us the flexibility and the benefits of autonomous and human agility and decision making,&#8221; said Falck.</p>
<p>The startup has been testing its AV system on public roads in Europe since 2019, but doesn&#8217;t yet have a date to start testing in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we don&#8217;t have a safety driver in the vehicle, or even room for a safety driver, we have to take a different approach to get the legislation,&#8221; said Falck. &#8220;It <span style="font-weight: 400;">varies from nation to nation and state to state, but at the core, it&#8217;s about guaranteeing the safety in the application itself.</span> That&#8217;s also been our approach since the start to be able to verify the safety case in all applications without the driver in the vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>A remote truck driver, or &#8216;pod operator&#8217; will oversee Einride&#8217;s pods and take over in certain situations.  Falck says he doesn&#8217;t believe in Level 5 autonomy, or one in which AVs essentially drive and think better than humans, and aims for Einride&#8217;s system to always have humans in the loop for better agility and decision making.</p>
<p>&#8220;Machines still work for the benefit of humans,&#8221; said Falck. &#8220;We&#8217;re still quite far from having that level of AI that the whole industry has been chasing for more than 15 years now, and for us, there are a lot of situations where you can get the benefits of autonomous but also the benefits of having a human in the loop. For instance, if you want to back up to a different gate or want to interact with the drivers around you. It&#8217;s really a benefit to have that human decision-making and doesn&#8217;t impact the business case too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Einride said it has hired its first pod operator, who has a background in trucking as well as a trucking license, and will reveal them at an event later this year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the U.S. launch announcement, Einride also said it would officially establish a U.S. headquarters in New York, where parts of the leadership team will be based, as well as regional offices in Austin, San Francisco and in the South East. It does not plan to build factories in the U.S. at this time.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cloudbeds provides software to lodging businesses that combines previously siloed functions into one integrated, cloud-based tool.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As U.S. hotel occupancy <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/covid-hit-hotel-industry-hard-data-shows-it-s-still-n1280061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit pre-pandemic levels</a> this summer, the hospitality industry is bracing for what is expected to be a rush of activity as people resume travel.</p>
<p>There are some tailwinds pushing those sails: The largest population of future travelers was born after 1979, and after saving more money over the last decade they now have more discretionary spending and want to use it to travel, said Adam Harris, co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.cloudbeds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudbeds</a>.</p>
<p>“The pandemic was unwelcoming for everyone, but travel is a $1 trillion industry, one of the top five largest in the world,” he added. “The demand that was there in 2019 is now even stronger because they’ve been cooped up at home for a year and a half.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228006" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228013" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228013" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228013" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png" alt="Cloudbeds" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228013" class="wp-caption-text">Cloudbeds product. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cloudbeds</p></div></p>
<p>Harris and Richard Castle founded San Diego-based Cloudbeds in 2012 to provide hospitality management software to lodging businesses, from independent hotels to vacation rentals, that combines previously siloed business functions, like operations, revenue, distribution and growth marketing, into one integrated, cloud-based tool.</p>
<p>As a result of all that pent-up energy, Harris believes we will soon see travel numbers never seen before. To capitalize on that, the company secured $150 million led by new investor SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>Cloudbeds started a relationship with SoftBank two years ago, and Harris noted the investor is “one of the best travel investors in the world,” most recently infusing capital into travel companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/softbank-backed-travel-tech-startup-yanolja-acquires-korean-e-commerce-company-interpark/">Yanolja</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/getyourguide-closes-133m-convertible-note-as-travel-startups-continue-to-weather-the-covid-19-storm/">GetYourGuide</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/klook-200-milllion-funding/">Klook</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew Zloto, director at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said via email that in today’s market it was “critical” for hotels to adopt technology so that they can compete, and that the global pandemic was a driver for the accelerated adoption we are seeing.</p>
<p>“We believe Cloudbeds has harnessed this opportunity to fundamentally change how the hospitality industry uses technology,” he said. “Cloudbeds has taken what has traditionally been a siloed, complex web of technology services and combined it into a single platform that’s a great solution for properties of all sizes. By simplifying and consolidating critical business tools, the company is working to level the playing field for independent hoteliers and help them to thrive in a constantly evolving market.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Joining SoftBank are new investors Echo Street and Walleye Capital and existing investors Viking Global Investors, PeakSpan Capital and Counterpart Ventures. This latest funding round takes Cloudbeds&#8217; total venture funding raised to date to $253 million.</p>
<p>Armed with the new funding, the company will continue to expand on R&amp;D, invest in education and advocacy and grow its teams in engineering, product and sales. The company will also round out its leadership with a focus on having a team in place for a pre-IPO, Castle said.</p>
<p>Harris did not want to disclose growth metrics, but did say that Cloudbeds was one of only a handful of companies that grew last year despite the pandemic. It currently serves over 22,000 global customers across 157 countries.</p>
<p>“We believe the company can be a $20 billion company,” he added. “If you look at the race amongst competitors, we are in the lead. We have to deploy some cash, and that keeps us up at night a bit. We now have predictability in our business model, and the goal is to build an IPO candidate and mature the organization.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Allbirds' IPO pricing backs up our view that tech-enabled unicorns going public can hope for an upper-single-digit revenue multiple provided they can make a good case to public market investors.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of somewhat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">slack earnings from the recently public Robinhood</a>, you might have expected the public-offering game to slow a bit. Nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Last night, consumer DTC shoe company Allbirds, backed by an ocean of private capital, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88103/DTC-shoe-brand-Allbirds-prices-upsized-IPO-above-the-range-at-$15">priced its IPO at $15 per share</a>, $1 above its expected range. The company also registered an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001653909/000162828021021285/allbirdss-1mef.htm">extra million shares</a> for its offering, adding to its heft and the general positive vibe of its upcoming IPO.</p>
<p>This brings us back to our ongoing conversation regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/allbirds-flotation-should-help-the-market-sort-the-value-of-tech-enabled-ipos/">the value of tech-enabled unicorns</a> busy finding public-market liquidity.</p>
<p>Recall that when Rent the Runway <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/rent-the-runways-ipo-pricing-indicates-bullish-market-for-unicorns-of-all-stripes/">priced its IPO</a>, it was worth &#8220;just over 7x its July 31, 2021 run rate (quarter times four).&#8221; The fact that the company has since suffered sharp declines from $21 to roughly $16 per share post-debut is not material; we care about IPO prices, not post-listing moves.</p>
<p>Earlier, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/allbirds-flotation-should-help-the-market-sort-the-value-of-tech-enabled-ipos/">we noted</a> that at $14 per share and the previously slightly lower share count, Allbirds would be worth just under 9x its current annual run rate on a fully-diluted basis. At $15 per share, and with an extra million shares, Allbirds is worth mid-9x its current run rate, depending on how you count shares.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s very early so please don&#8217;t get too hung up on modestly relaxed math!)</p>
<p>Allbirds&#8217; IPO pricing, then, backs up our general view that tech-enabled unicorns going public can hope for an upper-single-digit revenue multiple provided they can make a good case to the larger pool of public-market investors.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Battery Ventures' State of the OpenCloud report provides a set of data points that pretty clearly outline the accelerated growth of cloud services in recent quarters. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a> released its <a href="https://www.battery.com/opencloud-2021/">State of the OpenCloud</a> report today, providing a set of data points that clearly outline the accelerated growth of cloud services in recent quarters.</p>
<p>The report helps explain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">the race to invest capital</a> into startups that we’ve been observing over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>The pandemic pushed companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/saas-earnings-rise-as-pandemic-pushes-companies-more-rapidly-to-the-cloud/">to start using cloud services</a> — infrastructure, platform or SaaS — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">earlier and quicker than they might have otherwise</a>. That resulted in big investments, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">eye-popping IPOs</a>, and tremendous revenue growth for software companies of all stripes, especially those built atop open-source code.</p>
<p>Consider this tidbit from the report: &#8220;The average infrastructure-software IPO valuation has increased 10 times over the last 10 years, and there are more infrastructure-software companies valued at $10 billion or more than ever before.” What&#8217;s more, the data implies a healthy pipeline of major cloud IPOs.</p>
<p>Battery believes that the cloud market could eventually be worth $1 trillion. When you consider that the vast majority of work, development and computing will be done in the cloud at some point, the investment group’s round-number projection may prove modest.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			This report makes it clear that despite the tremendous growth numbers we have seen recently, we are still just scratching the surface of the cloud&#8217;s potential.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That’s our takeaway. While the digital transformation is evident and startling, this report makes it clear that despite the nigh-incredible growth numbers we have seen recently, we are still just scratching the surface of the cloud&#8217;s potential.</p>
<h2>Public cloud acceleration</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">Amazon’s AWS public cloud platform is big business</a>. Amazon breaks out its results on a quarterly basis, showing the world exactly how much cloud revenue it generates, as well as the resulting operating profit. Microsoft also breaks out growth for its Azure service, but with other services included in the reporting category, the exact number is harder to nail down.</p>
<p>Battery’s report gives us per-platform data. In Q2 2021, the venture capital firm reckons that AWS reached a $59 billion run rate, while Azure hit $37 billion and Google Cloud reached $19 billion — and this was before the companies reported Q3 results.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227985" style="width: 2814px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227985" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2227985 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg" alt="Battery State of Cloud Report - Slide 5 - Cloud infrastructure market growth" width="2804" height="1576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg 2804w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-3.42.12-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2804px) 100vw, 2804px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227985" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Battery Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>Critically, Battery&#8217;s Q2 figures were up an aggregate 44% compared to a year earlier — the growth has accelerated from an early-pandemic low of 36% in Q2 of last year. Indeed, since the second quarter of 2020, public cloud growth has either held steady or risen.</p>
<p>Given the sheer amount of dollars involved in these figures, the acceleration of growth from 36% to 44% is incredibly material: The three cloud platforms closed Q2 2021 on a combined run rate of $115 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration has ordered nearly all federal agencies to patch hundreds of security bugs, some that were first found the best part of a decade ago.</p>
<p>The new binding operational directive, issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday, gives federal agencies six months to fix <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">more than 300 security vulnerabilities</a> that it has identified as carrying &#8220;significant risk&#8221; to their networks. Agencies have just two weeks to fix the more recent bugs from 2021, the directive said.</p>
<p>CISA said these security bugs, some of which date back to 2014 and 2015, are a &#8220;frequent attack vector&#8221; for cybercriminals targeting federal agencies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The directive, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-to-order-federal-agencies-to-fix-hundreds-of-cyber-flaws-11635937200?st=t65m61h2hompm75&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">first reported</a> by The Wall Street Journal, applies to most civilian federal agencies, but carves out exceptions for networks run by the military and under the Defense Department or the intelligence community, which are managed separately.</p>
<p>Federal agencies are largely left to manage their cybersecurity efforts, like rolling out security patches. Since 2015, federal agencies were <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/15-01/">first mandated</a> to fix &#8220;critical&#8221; security bugs within a month of public disclosure, and in 2019 that was <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/19-02/">expanded to include</a> fixes for high-severity bugs as well.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/30/government-investigation-finds-federal-agencies-failing-at-cybersecurity-basics/">the government&#8217;s own watchdog</a> has said some federal agencies still struggle with the cybersecurity basics. According to the Journal, many of the bugs in the new directive weren&#8217;t previously covered, a tacit nod to how seemingly less-impactful bugs can still cause significant damage or disruption if exploited.</p>
<p>“The Directive lays out clear requirements for federal civilian agencies to take immediate action to improve their vulnerability management practices and dramatically reduce their exposure to cyber attacks,&#8221; said CISA Director Jen Easterly in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this Directive applies to federal civilian agencies, we know that organizations across the country, including critical infrastructure entities, are targeted using these same vulnerabilities. It is therefore critical that every organization adopt this Directive and prioritize mitigation of vulnerabilities listed in CISA’s public catalog,&#8221; said Easterly.</p>
<p>Rep. Jim Langevin, a member of the House Armed Services&#8217; subcommittee on cyber, said the CISA directive &#8220;will go a long way towards strengthening network security and improving our federal cyber hygiene.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Archive.ai founders believe the future of marketing will be a culture of “building with you” versus the “talking at you” approach they believe traditional digital marketing is doing now.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When marketers Paul Benigeri and Geoffrey Woo were at their former companies, in food tech and e-commerce infrastructure, respectively, they experienced how manual and repetitive digital marketing workflows were, especially as the number of disparate and unintegrated marketing tools grew.</p>
<p>With the goal of making their own lives easier, they formed <a href="http://archive.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archive.ai</a> in March to build technology that connects databases and distribution channels so they talk to each other and to address what they believe will be the future of marketing — “building with you” — versus the “talking at you” approach the founders believe traditional digital marketing is doing.</p>
<p>Its two initial products are Archive, a Shopify app that automatically detects, classifies and saves Instagram stories relating to a brand, and Archive Communities, which makes influencer marketing programmatic so that brands can more quickly scale their community-building efforts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227888" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228392" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228392" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228392" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg" alt="Archive.ai" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg 4800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=1536,804 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=2048,1072 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228392" class="wp-caption-text">Archive.ai dashboard</p></div></p>
<p>In fact, Woo, who is chairman of Archive.ai, said via email that the company is pioneering a new approach to digital marketing it calls &#8220;community marketing.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This takes ideas from influencer marketing, affiliate marketing, loyalty programs and community management,” he said. “Much of the existing services operate in silos and don&#8217;t inter-operate well. Also since Apple banned the Facebook tracking pixel with iOS 14 in recent months, a lot of the paid social media advertising has become exorbitantly inefficient for most e-commerce companies.”</p>
<p>Before incorporating, the company was a profitable project, according to Woo. Its list of enterprise customers includes Four Sigmatic, CEO Benigeri’s former company Health Via Modern Nutrition and some household names he was not ready to say yet. There are over 40 alpha testers on Archive App with more than 200 people on the waitlist. The company expects to go live with Archive App before the end of November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, to “properly build a next-generation community marketing technology company,” as Woo put it, the company decided to go after some venture capital. Today, it announced $4.068 million in funding led by Stripe.</p>
<p>Also joining in on the round were Lux Capital, Sugar Capital and Anti Fund, as well as a group of individual investors that included Ramp CEO Eric Glyman and CTO Karim Atiyeh, Attentive CEO Brian Long and CPO Andrew Jones, Applied Intuition CEO Qasar Younis and Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the company tripled its headcount to 36 people, and its monthly recurring revenue grew 58% since April. The company also intends to triple the engineering team to focus on workflow automations and machine learning to assist and streamline marketing tasks and decisions.</p>
<p>In addition, plans include building out a marketing team. Kwan Kim recently joined Archive.ai as head of growth after being the first digital marketing hire for Recurly and scaling the company to its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/accel-kkr-acquires-recurly--edf88647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition by Accel-KKR</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Archive gives businesses an easy way to review and, more importantly, understand what their customers are actually saying — the north star for every smart company,” Chris Sperandio, corporate development lead at Stripe, said in a written statement. “We’re excited to invest in Archive and, in doing so, to help their users grow internet-enabled commerce.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kneron has launched its first automotive-grade chip — fueled by funds from Foxconn, Alibaba, Sequoia, Horizons Ventures, and Qualcomm — that it says could revolutionize the path to vehicle autonomy.</p>
<p>The chip industry has been dominated by legacy and tech companies like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm. Kneron – which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/delta-electronics-kneron/">raised over $100 million to date</a> – has quickly emerged as a startup that deserves attention. Its chips are already being used by Otus, which supplies aftermarket advanced driver assistance systems to Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi. With the new chip, the Kneron KL530, the startup is looking to take a greater share of the automotive market.</p>
<p>The Kneron KL530 has two major innovations, according to CEO Albert Liu: it supports Vision Transformers (ViT), as opposed to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); and it has a 4-bit data processor. Together, he says this results in more accurate image detection and decreased processing time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228007" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Both ViTs and CNNs are deep learning models, but up until this point transformers have been very difficult to implement in hardware, Liu said. “[The] transformer itself is a whole new class of architecture design, which can beat the accuracy and performance [of CNN chips] significantly,” he added. “Anything related to time-series judgment, for example, voice recognition or behavior recognition, the transformer can have much better performance.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228140" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228140" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228140" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg" alt="Kneron CEO Albert Liu" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg 7952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228140" class="wp-caption-text">Kneron CEO Albert Liu</p></div></p>
<p>As opposed to CNNs, ViTs make inferences holistically, not just based on specific features but an amalgamation of all features in a space. Liu gave the example of a big white truck against a cloudy sky backdrop. A CNN might infer that the big white object must also be part of the sky – putting the vehicle at risk of hitting the truck – while a ViT would process not only the visual white area but also the things delineating it as a truck, like the wheels, and the boundary around it.</p>
<p>The KL530’s other major innovation is the 4 bit data processor, which can reduce data processing times compared to 32 bit and 8 bit processors. It can also process more frames per second, reducing processing time by up to 66%, without a commensurate increase in power consumption. It can detect more apertures within any given time, so things like facial recognition can be sped up by up to half a second.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“That means more safety in automotive applications,” Liu said, because decision-making can occur that much faster.</p>
<p>Overall, Kneron says the new chip has up to two times more TOPS/watt over its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/kneron-launches-its-new-ai-chip-to-challenge-google-and-others/">custom chip KL520</a>. The chip also has an image system processor, which enables a 1080P resolution, blind spot detection, classification, distance measuring, and hazard recognition.</p>
<p>The chip will be released in two versions, one for the aftermarket and one to be built directly into the vehicle. The chips will be used in the forthcoming vehicles that Foxconn is manufacturing under its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/foxconn-unveils-three-new-ev-prototypes/amp/">Foxtron brand in collaboration with Taiwan’s Yulon Motor</a>. Kneron is in the process of delivering sample orders to other customers, and anticipates entering mass production by the first quarter of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Chevy Bolt recall was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/lg-will-cover-nearly-the-entire-cost-of-gms-chevy-bolt-ev-recall/">huge and expensive setback</a> for GM — and arguably the broader EV market.</p>
<p>The sheer number of vehicles — about 141,000 — highlighted the fact that neither battery cell supplier LG Chem nor GM could pinpoint exactly which batteries had defects. The companies only knew that problems within LG Chem&#8217;s battery cell manufacturing operations could increase the risk of fire in some, not all, cars.</p>
<p>One company, Voltaiq, is working to make sure that these types of &#8220;just replace all the batteries in all the cars&#8221; recalls don&#8217;t become commonplace.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226528" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s so-called Enterprise Battery Intelligence (EBI) platform doesn&#8217;t add more sensors to the battery, instead, it uses data already available from the pack and presents it to automakers, tech companies and battery manufacturers in a way that&#8217;s easy to understand and that can help them assess the health of the system.</p>
<p>It goes beyond what&#8217;s already out there on the road today and works down the supply chain with cell suppliers. Founded in 2012, Voltaiq helps make sense of all that data and presents it in a way that helps when things are about to go sideways. It can also signal to a company when something isn&#8217;t up to snuff at any point in time from the mines and R&amp;D to testing and installation in a device.</p>
<p>Voltaiq&#8217;s tech has already won over some automakers. The system is used by Mercedes-Benz, two of the Detroit Big Three automakers (although they would not share the names of those companies) and tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all comes down to the fact that the battery is fundamentally different than any other component in our modern devices. Everything else is mechanical or semiconductor in nature,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Tal Sholklapper told TechCrunch. Sholklapper noted that batteries are almost like a living, breathing being, with complex, nuanced and unpredictable behavior over their entire life cycle. Understanding how these sometimes volatile components tick requires sorting through a lot of data, and that&#8217;s where Voltaiq comes in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Voltaiq says that the analytics software it provides reduces hundreds of hours of sorting through information and surfacing just the data that&#8217;s required by a company and its researchers. The system can also help do spot checks of batteries being delivered by suppliers. In some cases, its customers have noted that these checks have found formulation changes in battery chemistry that a cell supplier had implemented but not informed Voltaiq&#8217;s client.</p>
<p>One case Voltaiq shared was that before they were brought on by one automaker, the OEM had an issue that caused a massive delay. About a month before a vehicle was set to launch, the battery they were supplied failed qualification. In other words, it wasn&#8217;t going to work. By the time the company was able to secure a new battery supplier, it was 18 months after the initial launch date. The startup could have detected that issue before it was delivered and could have helped the supplier or alerted the OEM of the problem.</p>
<p>Voltaiq wouldn&#8217;t comment on the woes that GM and LG Chem are experiencing. The Voltaiq platform&#8217;s ability to spot issues before its installed in a vehicle, perform regular health checks and be able to identify which batch of batteries have the potential to experience a problem, could reduce the types of recalls GM is going through right now.</p>
<p>There are other companies out there doing what Voltaiq does. However, Voltaiq&#8217;s co-founders contend that competition mostly comes from its potential customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because this is engineering data, there&#8217;s still this desire for the OEMs to own it and do it in-house. So we see this, like, build versus buy behavior,&#8221; co-founder and CTO Eli Leland said.</p>
<p>Two customers that initially tried that approach were Microsoft and Google. Both figured they could tackle it themselves. Now they&#8217;re Volatiq customers.</p>
<p>Most companies don&#8217;t see themselves as battery companies. And yet, batteries are central to the devices they&#8217;re selling — and customers are buying. From voice-assistant powered speakers and the latest EVs to the energy storage facilities on the electric grid in places like Hawaii and Australia, the chemistry that keeps the lights on, the wheels rolling and the tunes pumping could do with some better understanding.</p>
<p>For all those applications and more, knowing what&#8217;s going on in the lithium-ion pack is becoming more important than ever. Just ask GM.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DoorDash is introducing SafeDash, a new in-app security toolkit aimed at helping its delivery providers feel safe while they work. SafeDash is rolling out in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Users on the delivery side of the platform across the U.S. will get access to SafeDash by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The company has partnered with ADT to launch two new features within the toolkit. The &#8216;safety reassurance call&#8217; feature lets users connect with an ADT agent through the Dasher app in instances where they may feel unsafe. The ADT agent will remain on the phone until the individual feels safe. If the incident escalates, and the person is unresponsive for a period of time, ADT will contact 911 to request an emergency response to their last known location, based on GPS from their smartphone.</p>
<p>DoorDash is also rolling out an &#8217;emergency assistance button&#8217; that allows users to seek help if needed. Once a delivery person clicks the button, an ADT agent will contact 911 and discreetly stay in contact with them via text messages. The agent will then pass along critical information, such as the person&#8217;s location, to 911 operators. The company notes that this feature allows users to get help from 911 without having to speak on the phone.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2227931" style="width: 217px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227931" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2227931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/toolkit.gif" alt="" width="207" height="407" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: DoorDash</strong></p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;SafeDash was born out of feedback from Dashers, and our hope is that with access to these tools, we’re giving Dashers yet another resource to feel safe and secure on the road,&#8221; said Elizabeth Jarvis-Shean, DoorDash’s vice-president of communications and policy, in a statement.</p>
<p>DoorDash says it plans to develop more features for the toolkit and is looking to launch virtual  education resources, direct communications, educational materials, and in-app guidance in the future. It&#8217;s worth noting that DoorDash&#8217;s SafeDash toolkit is similar to Uber&#8217;s driver <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/emergencybutton/">Safety Toolkit</a>, which also includes an in-app emergency assistance button and several other features.</p>
<p>The launch of SafeDash follows DoorDash’s forecast of a potentially <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/DASH-Q2-2021-Letter-to-Shareholders_FINAL.pdf">weaker Q3</a>, citing the ongoing uncertainty around how consumer behavior related to the pandemic may continue to impact its business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.questdb.io/">QuestDB</a>, makers of the speedy open source time series database, announced $12 million Series A today from 468 Capital, Uncorrelated Ventures and a list of industry angels including Alexis Ohanian. The company has now raised a total of $14.3 million including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/questdb-nabs-2-3m-seed-to-build-open-source-time-series-database/">$2.3 million seed</a> announced last July.</p>
<p>Since that time, the startup, which was a member of the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/questdb">Y Combinator summer 2020</a> cohort, has been working hard to build a community around the open source project, while working on the enterprise version and an upcoming hosted version, which should be ready by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Customers can install the enterprise version on their cloud of choice and manage it themselves, but the company has been hearing requests from customers for something easier.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is something that a lot of companies have been asking us about. Essentially, most companies do not want to deal with the operational complexity of hosting on their own cloud. And they want the database provider to host that on their behalf,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Nicolas Hourcard told me.</p>
<p>The database is built for speed and is fast enough that companies using Quest can cut back on servers, which they often will use to make up for lost speed on the database side. As Hourcard told TechCrunch at the time of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/questdb-nabs-2-3m-seed-to-build-open-source-time-series-database/">the seed funding</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re building an open source database for time series data, and time series databases are a multi-billion-dollar market because they’re central for financial services, IoT and other enterprise applications. And we basically make it easy to handle explosive amounts of data, and to reduce infrastructure costs massively.<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>On the open source front, Quest has built a Slack community with over 900 developers and over 70 code contributors have helped out on the project. In addition, the founders started a group made up of Y Combinator alums who have built businesses on open source and have 100 members in that group. The group meets regularly to discuss issues related to their chosen business model and hear from successful open source company founders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the commercial side, they wouldn&#8217;t share the number of customers, but indicated that the enterprise product has features like more flexibility around the deployment and making it easier to operate quickly at scale.</p>
<p>So far the company has 15 employees with plans to double that number in the next six months if things continue to go according to plan. Hourcard believes that as an open source and fully remote company, it should help to build a more diverse workforce.&#8221;We don&#8217;t pose limits in terms of where we&#8217;re going to hire or what sort of backgrounds, and we think that diversity ultimately would benefit the company&#8217;s culture, so we&#8217;re trying to do that the best we can,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says that sometimes an employee can be an open source contributor first, who shows knowledge and enthusiasm for the product. &#8220;Open source is an amazing way of getting to meet developers from different areas, and it&#8217;s true that sometimes you see a contributor who [is making a big] contribution, and then there is the question, &#8216;okay, should we bring this person the team,'&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>This time around, Tiger Global Management doubled down on its investment into the company to lead the round. Durable Capital Partners, which led the Series D, Norwest Venture Partners, Citi Ventures and OurCrowd also participated.</p>
<p>Referred to as the “Great Resignation,” nearly 20 million people quit their jobs between April and August 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey</a>. At the same time, the Census also reported that over 4 million applications for new businesses were filed between January and September of this year.</p>
<p>“This has heightened demand for software to support the needs of independent business owners,” Alon said. “They’re looking for a platform to help them manage their client flow and cash flow, and that’s what HoneyBook does.”</p>
<p>In addition, attitudes toward the value of work are changing across the board as many businesses are now more willing to outsource work to independent contractors, he added.</p>
<p>Not only did that shift yield double HoneyBook’s annual recurring revenue since the beginning of 2021, the company also more than doubled its new subscribers in the last 12 months. Its members also achieved success, Alon noted, booking more than $1.8 billion on the platform in 2021, bringing total bookings to over $5 billion since the company launched in 2013.</p>

<p>HoneyBook did not plan to raise this quickly, but the existing investors saw that growth and more independent workers emerging and wanted to “deepen their partnership with us,” Alon said.</p>
<p>“They understood the opportunity in front of us and decided to double down on their investment in our mission to help independent businesses be successful,” he added. “We’re very lucky to be supported by a great community of investors who share our values and are aligned with our vision for the long-term.”</p>
<p>HoneyBook isn’t alone, joining several companies focused on independent workers that announced new rounds in the past several months. For example, Contra, a professional network for independent workers, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/independent-worker-network-contra-goes-commission-free-as-it-secures-new-nea-led-capital/">$30 million in Series B funding</a>, while Lean brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/former-head-of-mint-raises-4-5m-for-lean/">$4.5 million in seed funding</a> to support gig workers with financial products. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/all-day-kitchens-wants-to-expand-every-independent-restaurants-delivery-network/">All Day Kitchens</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/owner-com-serves-up-10-7m-so-that-independent-restaurants-can-get-cooking/">Owner.com</a> also raised money to do something similar, but for restaurants.</p>
<p>Going forward, HoneyBook has plans to provide more financial services and will use the new funding on that product development and to get additional new features to market quicker, Alon said.</p>
<p>“We know that cash flow is one of the biggest challenges independent businesses face,” he added. “To do that we also need to continue attracting great talent and we are hiring for a number of exciting roles across our teams in the U.S. and Israel. We have big goals for 2022 and beyond as we continue to support the independent business category.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo&#8217;s self-driving cars will make an appearance in New York City on Thursday, but don&#8217;t expect to hail a robotaxi in the Big Apple anytime soon — or ever.</p>
<p>The company is a long way from testing or launching its autonomous vehicles commercially in the city. Instead, Waymo announced plans to manually drive its vehicles to map areas of the densely populated city and then use all of that data to advance its technology.</p>
<p>Waymo will deploy up to five of its hybrid Chrysler Pacifica minivans on the streets of Manhattan, from the south side of Central Park all the way to the financial district and through the Lincoln Tunnel to a small section of New Jersey. By early next year, Waymo says it hopes to bring in several of its zero-emission Jaguar I-PACEs, which will also driven manually. Each vehicle will have two people, one to drive and another in the passenger seat to help direct the activity of the driver, monitor the software on the vehicle in real time, evaluate the performance and log comments, according to Waymo.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228125" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Even though Waymo won&#8217;t be operating in autonomous mode, all of the vehicles it deploys in NYC will be equipped with the <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2020/03/introducing-5th-generation-waymo-driver.html">fifth generation Waymo Driver</a>, which uses a combination of lidar, radar and cameras and is informed by 20 million self-driven miles on public roads and over 10 billion miles in simulation, according to Waymo.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mapping process is a critical part of our operations,&#8221; Nick Smith, a Waymo spokesperson, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Here&#8217;s how it works: First, we drive our Waymo vehicles on public roads and collect information with our sensor suite. Next, we take that information, clean it up and automatically or manually annotate it with features such as crosswalks, road edges, curb heights, boundary paint, intersections, etc. Then we put our newly-created map through quality control testing. This process is the same no matter where we go, and is also the same process we follow when updating our maps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because Waymo will be manually driving around the city, its cars will be able to drive in almost any weather condition, which the company says provides unique learning opportunities for the next generation of the Waymo Driver. New York City is known for heavy rainfall, and even hurricanes, in the summer and dense snowfall in the winter, conditions that autonomous systems haven&#8217;t yet figured out. Waymo says driving in NYC will allow the company to assess the way its sensors perform in wet, cold conditions in real life, rather than just in data augmentation and simulation testing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If Waymo does choose to one day test its AVs against the chaos of New York&#8217;s jaywalkers, rogue hot dog carts and daredevil cyclists, it&#8217;ll need to apply for <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/dmv/apply-autonomous-vehicle-technology-demonstration-testing-permit">New York State&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology testing permit</a>. In September, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/03/dot-moves-to-allow-self-driving-car-tests-on-nyc-streets/">NYC Mayor de Blasio introduced legislation</a> that would see companies road testing self-driving cars on the streets to apply for additional $5,000-per-year permits from the NYC DOT.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">This summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/intels-mobileye-takes-its-autonomous-vehicle-testing-program-to-new-york-city/">Intel&#8217;s Mobileye became the first to win a permit to test its autonomous vehicle technology in NYC</a>. Waymo says it doesn&#8217;t have any immediate plans to launch in the city because it&#8217;s more interested in training its self-driving system and applying the learnings across its fleet. In August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/waymo-launches-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">Waymo launched a limited, non-commercial robotaxi service in San Francisco</a> and began scaling up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">autonomous trucking operations in Texas, California and Arizona</a>. The following month, the California Department of Motor Vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">awarded Waymo a &#8220;drivered deployment permit,&#8221;</a> which is a step in the direction of launching a paid robotaxi service in the state.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">ZipCharge has launched a new type of charging product for EVs that might be able to convince people worried about range anxiety to switch from gas vehicles. The British startup has introduced a powerbank for EVs called <a href="https://www.zipcharge.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">ZipCharge Go</a> at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-climate-change-000051729.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Cop26</a> climate summit. It&#8217;s about the size of a suitcase and weighs around 50 pounds — plus, it has wheels and a retractable handle, so users can put it in their trunk and easily take it out when they need to charge.</p>
<p>According to the company, the Go can provide up 20 miles of range after being plugged into the car for 30 minutes. A higher capacity version will be able to provide an EV up to 40 miles of range. The device works with any plug-in hybrid or EV with a Type 2 socket, and it can charge that vehicle to its full capacity between 30 minutes to an hour. Charging up the device itself is as easy as plugging it into any socket, and users will be able to control and monitor it through an app, where they can schedule future charges during off-peak hours for cheaper costs.</p>

<p>That said, the ZipCharge Go isn&#8217;t available yet. According to <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/545066/zipcharge-go-portable-ev-charger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>InsideEVs</em></a>, the startup plans to release a 4 kWh and an 8 kWh version, as well as to start deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2022. It can be leased for at least £49 (US$67) per month, though it will also be available for purchase to EV owners who don&#8217;t mind paying for one and to businesses like hotels that don&#8217;t have installed charging facilities. While ZipCharge has yet to reveal a price for it, <a href="https://www.driving.co.uk/news/business/zipcharge-portable-ev-charger-unveiled-cop26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em>The Sunday Times Driving</em></a> section says the company aims to sell it for around the same cost as a 7.2kW home charging port installation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228367" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another big raise in the alternative protein space: <a href="https://futurefarm.io/en_GB/">Future Farm</a>, a Brazilian-based foodtech startup that touts plant-based meat substitutes with a &#8220;true&#8221; meat-like texture, has closed a $58 million Series C funding round, co-led by BTG, as it gears up for rapid growth in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Other investors in the Series C include existing investors from its Series A and B, including Monashees, Go4It Capital, Turim MFO and Enfini Ventures, along with new investors XP Inc and Rage Capital (which co-led the round).</p>
<p>The 2019-founded startup has raised a total of $89M at this stage, and says its business<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> is now being valued at $400M+.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228337" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Series C funding will be used to get Future Farm&#8217;s range of plant-based meat substitutes into more retail outlets and human mouths.</p>
<p>It is also planning to grow its range to add plant-based milks and &#8216;dairy&#8217; (including a butter alternative) &#8212; to try to cut itself a larger slice of consumers&#8217; shopping budgets.</p>
<p>Future Farm&#8217;s current product range &#8212; which is pretty self-explanatory in branding terms, featuring the likes of &#8216;Future Mince&#8217;, &#8216;Future Burger&#8217; and &#8216;Future Sausage&#8217; &#8212; is available in 24 countries via<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> 10,000 points of sale but the LatAm startup is keen to step that up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It launched products into the UK market at the start of last year &#8212; and touts strong growth in Europe where it says its annual growth rate is 960%. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overall, it flags that the plant-based meat replacement category is now being valued at $4.2BN globally. While, in the UK alone, the market is said to be worth $0.8BN &#8212; and growing 17% a year.</p>
<p>Global attention on the climate crisis (the <a href="https://ukcop26.org/">CO26 climate conference</a> is taking place in the UK right now) &#8212; and on the need for humanity to cut carbon emissions by taking actions like slashing meat consumption &#8212; is feeding demand for plant-based alternatives to traditional meat-based meals like hamburgers, bolognese and hot dogs.</p>
<p>Investors have responded to this pressure to change eating habits by feeding dollars to a wave of foodtech startups that promise to help meat-eaters effortlessly switch to a better-for-the-planet vegan lifestyle &#8212; &#8216;meatballs&#8217; and all (i.e. just without the actual meat bit).</p>
<p>The alternative protein space has thus become a hotbed of activity in recent years (although it&#8217;s worth noting that plant-based meat alternatives are nothing new, and products selling prepackaged veggie burgers etc date back decades; what&#8217;s new is pressure on consumers to switch and investor interest in the category), with food tech startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/beyond-meat-shares-rise-on-news-that-it-collaborated-with-mcdonalds-on-the-mcplant-options/">Beyond Meat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/impossible-foods-gobbles-up-another-200-million/">Impossible Foods</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/i-cant-believe-its-not-meat/">Meati</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/mushroom-based-meat-alternative-startup-fable-food-raises-6-5m-aud-will-launch-in-the-u-s/">Fable Food</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/swiss-maker-of-meat-alternatives-planted-will-expand-and-diversify-with-18m-series-a/">Planted</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/heuras-plant-based-chicken-hits-uk-shops/">Heura</a> mushrooming forth, to name a few.</p>
<p>There are also a growing number of lab-grown meat startups trying to keep actual meat on the menu but change its environmental profile by culturing cells in vats as an alternative production process to the intensive farming of animals which is both terrible for the planet and horrible for animal welfare.</p>
<p>Whatever happens with lab-grown meat, the future of food will certainly need to involve everyone eating a lot more plants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Timing is everything in healthcare &#8212; yet too often diagnoses, treatments and procedures are held up by paperwork, administrative red tape between patients, clinicians, carers, bookkeepers, insurance companies and others in the chain of relationships that needs to be processed before steps can be taken. Today a startup called <a href="https://www.notablehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notable</a>, which is building automation systems to help move that along, is announcing a growth round of $100 million as it finds a ready market for its technology among hundreds of customers, including large networks like Intermountain Healthcare and CommonSpirit Health to cut through the immense amount of what Pranay Kapadia, Notable&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, describes as &#8220;administrative overhead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The healthcare industry on average has $1.1 trillion in administrative spend, which is 8 times as many resources required per $1 billion of revenue as any other industry in the world,&#8221; he said of the annual budget given to all that work. &#8220;There are tens of thousands of workflows that can be automated.&#8221; He estimated that among Notable&#8217;s current customers, across some 350 locations, Notable&#8217;s systems are automating &#8220;millions&#8221; of tasks a year, &#8220;and growing exponentially.&#8221; The company is most active in the U.S. but has plans to take its tech to other markets and to segments adjacent to healthcare, such as health insurance, over time.</p>
<p>Iconiq Growth &#8212; the growth-stage arm of the San Francisco <a href="https://iconiqcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealth management and investment firm</a> connected to Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey and other high net-worth tech executives — is leading the Series B, with Greylock Ventures, Oak HC/ FT, and F-Prime also participating. Kapadia confirmed to me that the round values his startup at $600 million post-money. That&#8217;s a big jump for the company: previously it had raised just over $26 million and was last valued, earlier this year, at about $120 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/228399-67/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> estimates.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228327" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Notable&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/notable-launches-a-service-to-automatically-record-and-digitize-data-from-doctor-visits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweet spot</a> has been using robotic process automation combined with API integrations and other technologies to speed up some of the administrative work that connects the dots in a healthcare regiment. This could involve the clinical notes that a doctor has to access or update when seeing a patient; the paperwork and billing details that payers need to receive to authorize a treatment or medication; a person registering for a service; or something else in the bigger mix of actions and levers that move when a person encounters a medical environment.</p>
<p>Kapadia tells me that Notable was built out as a concept in the U.S. &#8212; it&#8217;s based out of San Mateo &#8212; out of conversations that he had with family members who are physicians and were complaining about all the busywork they had to do: it didn&#8217;t feel like it used their expertise as such and took them away from having more time to do work they were trained to do. Kapadia &#8212; who had spent years building products at Intuit and then fintech Blend (where he met the other two co-founders of Notable, engineer Justin White and product designer Adam Ting) &#8212; said he saw this as, essentially, the same problem as the one he was building to solve in the back office and in financial services.</p>
<p>The turn to using RPA, meanwhile, for more specific use cases beyond general back-office tasks is a sign of how the concept and technology has been maturing, with innovative tech companies tapping into more specialized areas of knowledge and figuring out how to bring more efficiency to them (another example of that: last week&#8217;s story of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/gluware-raises-43m-for-rpa-tech-that-automatically-detects-and-fixes-anomalies-in-network-configurations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gluware</a>, which uses RPA processes in devops technology).</p>
<p>Notable really came into its own earlier this year, when the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/notable-health-seeks-to-improve-covid-19-vaccine-administration-through-intelligent-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped build a system to let people sign up for Covid-19 vaccination slots</a>: its system automated the process of finding locations and also triaging people based on their ages, health conditions and so on. Kapadia also said that as the pace of vaccinating has slowed, the company is finding a more sustained impact in terms of not just what patients but also providers are looking for in healthcare experiences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The second order derivatives of the pandemic are that patients and consumers [now] expect touchless digital experiences,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s actually just absolutely crucial.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the other interesting effect has been on the provider side, where tools like Notable&#8217;s are taking away some of the less satisfying parts of jobs and potentially making working more engaging for people, and in some cases are picking up the slack when there are staff shortages.</p>
<p>&#8220;People talk about the great resignation,&#8221; he said, referring to how so many have willingly pivoted careers during the pandemic. &#8220;Sure, but the reality is that only happens when people are doing jobs they don&#8217;t want to do. What&#8217;s more important in healthcare is it&#8217;s actually really hard to hire. There&#8217;s a staffing shortage at this moment in time. And so you&#8217;re the way that we&#8217;ve built out the platform, really understanding the data model that exists in healthcare, really understanding the tools that you actually need to build what we call flows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kapadia said he doesn&#8217;t see companies like UiPath or other big players in RPA as potential competitors because of the specialized body of knowledge that Notable has built up in healthcare, which is what both helps the system execute tasks and learn how to do them more efficiently. On the other hand, he says that the company&#8217;s biggest challenge has been in the fact that so much up to now has been stuck in analogue processes, and the fact that healthcare as an industry has &#8212; ironically, given that on the clinical and research sides there have been so many technological innovations &#8212; not really been a technology-led one when it comes to administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The road to purgatory in health tech is driven by integration, and the road to purgatory in deploying any technology is driven by timelines,&#8221; he said, adding that, often when organizations have focused on back office elements in the past, &#8220;What they&#8217;ve created is a faster hamster wheel.&#8221; In a wider healthcare system that doesn&#8217;t look like it will be changing fast &#8212; providers will continue to consolidate, payers will continue to exist, patients are continuing to live longer and have more problems as a result that can be identified and fixed &#8212; this means that, simply put, a new approach to speeding up connections has to come.</p>
<p>“Physicians today spend more time in front of their computer than in front of patients,” said Dr. S. Nicholas Desai, Chief Medical Information Officer at Houston Methodist, in a statement. “By automating all of the administrative tasks that clinicians are required to perform, Notable empowers us to practice at top of license and better serve patients in our communities.”</p>
<p>“We’ve had the pleasure of knowing Pranay, Adam, Justin, and the Notable team for nearly two years. We’ve been extremely impressed by their long history of great collaboration, the talent they’ve attracted to Notable along the way, and their unbridled passion to affect impact through exceptional technology and relentless focus on customers,&#8221; added Caroline Xie, general partner at ICONIQ Growth, in a statement. &#8220;Their vision resonated with us strongly—from digitally transforming and enriching patient-provider interactions with intelligent automation, to empowering providers, reducing administrative burden, and enabling state-of-the-art patient experiences. We believe Notable’s AI and extendibility of their platform are their key differentiators, and we’ve heard effusive feedback from leading health systems and customers citing strong patient and provider net promoter scores, fast time to value, and a strong return on investment.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[BrainCheck has several new initiatives in the works to close the loop with the patient journey that will be brought to market soon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the world’s population ages, more is being learned about brain health as startups leverage technology to find a way to slow down cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.braincheck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrainCheck</a>, a Houston- and Austin-based company developing cognitive healthcare software to aid physicians in detecting and managing this type of care, raised $10 million in Series B funding to expand its R&amp;D and go-to-market capabilities as it works on new digital therapeutics for Alzheimer’s and related dementias.</p>
<p>The round was led by Next Coast Ventures and S3 Ventures, which were joined by Nueterra Capital, Tensility Ventures and True Wealth Ventures. In addition, UPMC Enterprises and SelectQuote came on as strategic investors. The latest funding gives the company roughly $21 million in total funding raised to date, which includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/braincheck-raises-3-million-for-app-to-monitor-brain-health/">$3 million seed round</a> in 2016 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/this-startup-just-raised-8-million-to-help-busy-doctors-assess-the-cognitive-health-of-50-million-seniors/">$8 million in Series A funding</a> from 2019.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227732" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This startup just raised $8 million to help busy doctors assess the cognitive health of 50 million seniors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/this-startup-just-raised-8-million-to-help-busy-doctors-assess-the-cognitive-health-of-50-million-seniors/embed/#?secret=kAZlWi7q4O" data-secret="kAZlWi7q4O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>BrainCheck’s technology acts as a bridge between patients and the limited number of neurologists, about 12,000, in the U.S. Through 10- to 15-minute tests, performed in-person or remote (via a smartphone, tablet or computer), cognitive function can be detected early and more accurately.</p>
<p>Based on the test, patients are assigned a Cognitive Quotient (CQ) score, which is then used to produce a personalized cognitive care plan within minutes. Over 400 neurology, primary care and geriatrics practices use the technology currently, including Mount Sinai clinicians, which are using it to track and manage cognitive impairment resulting from COVID-19.</p>
<p>The pandemic has changed everything across the healthcare ecosystem, Yael Katz, PhD, co-founder and CEO of BrainCheck, told TechCrunch via email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company always had it in mind to raise another round two years after its Series A, but Katz said the global pandemic gave them pause to see how it would impact that decision. However, due to COVID shining a light on how people perceive healthcare and became more comfortable with remote care, they saw an opportunity to continue.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to continue to grow its team and invest in R&amp;D. It already has several new initiatives in the works to close the loop with the patient journey that will be brought to market soon, she added.</p>
<p>Over the last year, BrainCheck experienced year over year revenue growth increase three times, and Katz expects the same trajectory for next year. With the Series B, the goal remains the same as it was two years ago — double down on growth.</p>
<p>“From the shift to remote work and an increased prioritization of mental health, to investing in preventive medicine and supporting the aging population, all of these factors have come together to make the case that what we’re doing matters, and will continue to matter,” she said. “It’s never been more important for physicians to invest in a tool like BrainCheck and improve treatment across the patient journey.”</p>
