										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever listened to a podcast, you&#8217;ve probably heard a host ask you to leave a review on Apple Podcasts in their end credits. Now, that script might flip to &#8220;leave a review on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spotify announced today that it&#8217;s implementing a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/show-your-favorite-podcasters-you-love-them-with-spotifys-new-star-ratings-for-podcasts/">five-star rating system</a>, similar to Apple&#8217;s, in an attempt to improve podcast discovery. The company said this feature will roll out in the coming days in nearly all markets where podcasts are on Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify told TechCrunch that unlike Apple, this feature will only support star ratings at this time &#8212; you cannot yet write a written review of a show.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248735" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/show-your-favorite-podcasters-you-love-them-with-spotifys-new-star-ratings-for-podcasts/">wrote in a blog post</a> that it&#8217;s intention is to &#8220;give listeners an opportunity to support their favorite podcast shows and enable a two-way feedback loop between creator and listener.&#8221; But, after seeking out five-star Apple reviews since the advent of the podcasting medium, podcasters are wary about how much star ratings actually help them promote their shows.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a <a href="https://eventualmillionaire.com/how-to-get-your-podcast-into-new-and-noteworthy-in-itunes/">well</a>&#8211;<a href="https://www.weeditpodcasts.com/get-your-podcast-into-the-new-and-noteworthy/">documented</a> <a href="https://rachelcorbett.com.au/blog/new-and-noteworthy/">myth</a> in podcasting that getting lots of <a href="https://gaffincreative.com/how-to-get-featured-on-apple-podcasts-new-noteworthy/">ratings</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/how-to-get-your-podcast-featured-in-itunes-new-and-noteworthy">reviews</a> in your first few weeks after launch can improve your chances of getting listed on Apple Podcasts&#8217; coveted &#8220;New and Noteworthy&#8221; chart, which could jump-start your show&#8217;s growth. Besides, professional podcasters have pointed out that <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/852-ratings-and-reviews">Apple itself says</a> that ratings and reviews don&#8217;t influence charting.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Far too many podcasters (and an embarrassing number of podcast consultants) still think ratings and reviews on Apple Podcasts influence rankings. They don&#39;t. They never have. And if you don&#39;t believe me, perhaps you&#39;ll believe&#8230; Apple?<a href="https://t.co/ZpmwYWbNeZ">https://t.co/ZpmwYWbNeZ</a> <a href="https://t.co/TskiHpOFIR">pic.twitter.com/TskiHpOFIR</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A representative from Spotify told TechCrunch, &#8220;Ratings are a great way for prospective listeners to quickly gauge a show’s quality, but at this point (as we&#8217;re in early days for this feature), a show&#8217;s rating is not factored into podcast charts or personalized recommendations.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, this is a tool to show what fans think of a podcast, but as of now, not something that can help shows get on Spotify&#8217;s charts or curated lists.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Anchor, the podcast creation platform that </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">Spotify bought</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in 2019, offered suggestions in a blog post about how podcasters can encourage listeners to </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://blog.anchor.fm/updates/spotify-podcast-ratings">leave a rating</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Do you like this show? Let us know by leaving us a rating on our Spotify show page,&#8221; one example says. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;As a creator, I can see this feels like a marketing move,&#8221; said Eric Silver, Head of Creative at <a href="https://multitude.productions/">Multitude Productions</a>, an independent podcasting collective. &#8220;I don&#8217;t tell people to rate and review on Apple Podcasts at all because I know it doesn&#8217;t do anything other than make me feel good.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a similar marketing tactic to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/spotifys-wrapped-2021-arrives-with-artist-video-messages-blend-and-even-a-game/">Spotify Wrapped</a>, which trended across social media earlier this month &#8212; it&#8217;s fun to share your music and podcast listening habits with your friends, but at the same time, it&#8217;s a big PR success for Spotify.</p>
<p>Even though Spotify&#8217;s new rating system won&#8217;t impact distribution, Silver says that he will probably encourage listeners to rate Multitude shows on Spotify, at least for a few weeks. Spotify recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/spotify-says-u-s-podcast-listeners-now-use-its-service-more-than-apple-podcasts/">surpassed</a> Apple Podcasts in US podcast listenership &#8212; so if a large portion of potential audience members are going to see that rating right when they navigate to your show&#8217;s page, it makes sense to ask fans to rate your show.</p>
<p>YouTube, TikTok, and other creative platforms show potential audience members, right off the bat, how many followers you have. But you don&#8217;t know how many downloads and subscribers a podcast has unless the podcaster tells you. Even though ratings and reviews are an indication of popularity, this differentiates the podcasting industry from other more algorithmically-driven media, like video.</p>
<p>&#8220;Theoretically, the algorithm is supposed to help you. But isn&#8217;t this the tech conversation of our age?&#8221; said Silver. &#8220;It&#8217;s so complicated. It&#8217;s not just like, &#8216;Well, I wish there was an algorithm so there&#8217;s more discovery,&#8217; but then the opposite is when you have an issue like YouTube and TikTok.&#8221;</p>
<p>Creators on platforms like YouTube and TikTok are incentivized to make content that they think the algorithm likes, perhaps more so than what they think their audience will like. But even in media, that&#8217;s less algorithm-dependent, like podcasting and even Twitch streaming, there are still inherent biases. Earlier this year, when Twitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/spotify-says-u-s-podcast-listeners-now-use-its-service-more-than-apple-podcasts/">payout data</a> was leaked, it was revealed that the highest-paid woman streamer, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokimane">Pokimane</a>, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-06-twitch-leak-reveals-streamer-earnings-and-lack-of-diversity">only the 39th</a> highest paid on Twitch. Podcasting <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_feature/podcasts-diversity.php">isn&#8217;t known for its diversity</a> either.</p>
<p>Even though Spotify isn&#8217;t using podcast ratings for algorithmic recommendations yet, it could be part of a larger plan to make it easier to find podcasts. Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/spotify-acquires-podz-a-podcast-discovery-app/">acquired Podz</a> earlier this year to try to promote podcast discoverability.</p>
<p>In the short term, this is a clever move from Spotify to get podcasters to tell their audiences to go on Spotify, since they will need to make their show look good through ratings. This isn&#8217;t inherently a bad thing, but as Spotify and Apple compete for the greater share of the podcasting ecosystem, creators can feel like their livelihoods are caught in the middle of a larger tech race.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian edtech giant Byju’s, the nation’s most valuable startup, is in talks to go public in the U.S. by merging with a blank check company led by Churchill Capital, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Byju’s, currently valued at about $21 billion, is seeking a valuation of over $45 billion and looking to raise as much as $4 billion, the person said, requesting anonymity as they are not authorized to speak with the press.</p>
<p>The startup, which was founded in 2011 and launched its online learning platform in India in 2015, is hoping to list in the U.S. next year and also exploring an additional listing in its home market at a later stage, the person said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248844" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If the deal goes through, it would be the biggest SPAC deal to date, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/super-app-grab-starts-trading-on-supersized-spac-combination/">surpassing Singapore&#8217;s Grab</a>.</p>
<p>The talks haven&#8217;t been finalized yet and the terms may still change, the person cautioned. Bloomberg News first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/byju-s-is-said-in-talks-to-go-public-through-churchill-spac-deal">reported</a> about the talks.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported in August that Byju’s had started engaging with bankers to explore listing options. Several bankers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bankers-chase-byjus-for-ipo-valuation-pegged-up-to-50-billion/">offered Byju’s a valuation of $40 billion to $50 billion</a> if it listed next year, the report said.</p>
<p>Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools, accelerated its growth and those of several other online learning startups including Bangalore-headquartered Unacademy and Vedantu.</p>
<p>Byju’s, which was valued at under $6 billion in mid-2019, has expanded to the U.S. and several international markets in recent years and made a series of acquisitions to fuel the inorganic growth. This year itself it has spent $2 billion in cash and stock to acquire 10 startups.</p>
<p>Byju&#8217;s says it has over 100 million registered users, about 7 million of whom pay for the courses. The startup is aiming to generate revenue of $1.3 billion in the ongoing financial year, it has said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In addition to announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tiktok-to-diversify-its-for-you-feed-let-users-pick-the-topics-they-want-to-avoid/">coming changes</a> to its For You feed, TikTok today <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-editing-tools">announced</a> a handful of updates to its lineup of camera and editing tools, including new features for its popular Green Screen effect tool, as well as other updates to video enhancements and sound effects.</p>
<p>Among the updates, one highlight is the update to the Green Screen effect, which the company notes is one of the most-used effects on the platform since its 2019 <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/green-screen-effect-on-tik-tok/">launch</a>. The tool, which allows creators to position themselves in front of a different photo or video background, will now support GIFs.</p>
<p>To make this feature work, TikTok has partnered with GIPHY &#8212; notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">a Meta-owned</a> company. With the new integration, TikTok users will be able to select from a library of GIFs to use as their background, allowing for different types of videos. For example, users could record &#8220;reaction&#8221; videos with a GIF as the background, or they could use the tool to showcase or reference a particular meme.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248824" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, as TikTok expands to include more professional creators, we&#8217;ve seen the company begin to roll out tools that better cater to that particular audience &#8212; like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/tiktok-is-testing-a-desktop-streaming-software-called-tiktok-live-studio/">recent test of the desktop software</a> for live streamers. Now, the company says it will roll out an option to upload videos in 1080p HD. This feature will be available in &#8220;select countries&#8221; and will be available as a toggle (&#8220;Upload HD&#8221;) on the Publishing page under &#8220;More Options,&#8221; if available in your market.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter wp-image-2248841" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/tiktok-effects-cat.png?w=680" alt="" width="453" height="980" /></p>
<p>Another feature is a new Visual Enhancement button which will automatically improve the video&#8217;s exposure, low-light conditions and perform color correction. The idea is to offer users who aren&#8217;t necessarily video experts an easy one-tap tool that can make their content look better. To use the tool, after you record or upload a video, you&#8217;ll tap a new &#8220;Enhance&#8221; button that appears on the right-side panel. If you don&#8217;t like how the adjustments make the video look, just tap the button a second time and the effects will be removed.</p>
<p>In addition, TikTok is rolling out new musical and audio effects, including silly features that make voices or other sounds turn into either animal sounds or the sound of a musical instrument, including a flute, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suona">suona</a>, or a cat. The new features will be available on the Editing page by tapping the &#8220;Voice Effects: button on the right panel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instant grocery &#8212; where urban-dwelling consumers buy food and other essentials and can get them delivered in 15 minutes or less &#8212; continues to be a big business, and one of the juggernauts in the space is now raising a big round of funding to meet that opportunity: <a href="https://gopuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoPuff</a> is in the process of raising $1.5 billion, with a valuation of up to $40 billion.</p>
<p>From what we understand, the funding is being structured as a &#8220;Series X&#8221; convertible note from Guggenheim Partners. Other investors are not being disclosed. The size and nature of the raise, as a convertible note, is a strong indicator that this is a round being raised ahead of a liquidity event for Philadelphia-based GoPuff, most likely an IPO that could happen as soon as mid-2022.</p>
<p>The funding process was first discovered and flagged to us by <a href="https://PrimeUnicornIndex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Unicorn Index</a> (which <a href="https://www.axios.com/gopuff-valuation-40-billion-funding-round-878cda1b-03b5-4817-aa45-4e1542446989.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a> has also separately reported). The round has yet to close and the value of the raise and the valuation are the highest amount as indicated in the filing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248708" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The round is coming swiftly on the heels of a couple of other events for GoPuff. This summer, we broke the news that the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/gopuff-confirms-new-1b-cash-injection-at-a-15b-valuation-to-expand-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $1 billion at a $15 billion valuation</a>, and then in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/after-acquiring-dija-and-fancy-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-launches-in-the-uk-en-route-to-european-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November</a>, the company launched officially in London on the back of two acquisitions it had made, of Dija and Fancy, with plans to expand further into Europe.</p>
<p>That European expansion has involved some attempted M&amp;A in Europe: we&#8217;ve confirmed with sources on both sides of the deal that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/flink-the-berlin-based-instant-grocery-startup-is-now-valued-at-2-85b-after-raising-750m-in-a-round-led-by-doordash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoPuff had made an offer to acquire Flink out of Germany</a> &#8212; another instant grocery player.</p>
<p>That deal didn&#8217;t happen &#8212; not yet at least &#8212; because of differences of opinion on valuation, and a general appetite for getting acquired, according to sources. But it &#8212; and now this big funding round &#8212; both underscore GoPuff&#8217;s intentions and attentions.</p>
<p>Flink, incidentally, had also been approached by Amazon and is now being backed by DoorDash, which underscores just how much big competition GoPuff has here, but on the other hand, there are so many strong instant grocery players in Europe that there will continue to be a number of options for it and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Capital may help someone take the jump into entrepreneurship, but what about the activation energy to let them think that big in the first place? To <a href="https://twitter.com/cory">Cory Levy</a>, the latter has always been more important.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur behind <a href="https://www.firsttext.com/">First Text</a>, a low-friction service that connects founders to investors, launched<a href="https://www.zfellows.com/"> Z Fellows</a> last year to test out his take. The accelerator features a one-week sabbatical program that comes with a $10,000 check in optional equity, at a $1 billion cap, to aspiring founders.</p>
<p>“The best programs out there, whether that’s Y Combinator or the Thiel Fellowship, require this high commitment, big life decisions,” whether it’s dropping out of school or going full-time on an idea, he explained. “Hey, don’t do that, just kind of simulate what life would be like for a couple of days or a week: if you like it, great, if you don’t, no harm no foul,” he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248767" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Four cohorts in, Z Fellow announced that it is scaling its vision of bringing calculated risk and activation energy to, you guessed it, the crypto world.</p>
<p>The new crypto-focused accelerator, which is now accepting applications, will still come with a traditional venture capital check, but will have tailored programming on the sector’s many rabbit holes, from regulation to the best way to utilize technology in a decentralized world. Founders and investors involved with billion-dollar crypto companies will be available for mentorship, speaker talks, and daily stand ups, the founder said.</p>
<p>It’s the first of potentially many vertically-focused accelerators, and Levy thinks that it comes in a makeshift moment for crypto, as billions go into space (and billions more get raised off of plan to). He’s looking for startups working on crypto infrastructure, NFTs, DAOs, DeFi protocols and gaming.</p>

<p>Given that Z Fellows doesn’t require the same amount of buy in as a Y Combinator, quality assurance could be an issue. After all, who wouldn’t take a week of PTO, a $10,000 check, and a low-stakes chance to flirt with their entrepreneurial dream? Right now, about ⅓ of Z Fellows come from underrepresented backgrounds, which the accelerator defines as women, people of color, and/or immigrants.</p>
<p>For now, the founder is focused more on nudging people to try out an idea versus extreme vetting. Levy still interviews all fellows himself. He thinks the time-bound nature of the fellowship and mentorship is what makes Z Fellows stand out in today’s capital rich environment.</p>
<p>“While they may not need capital, I think one thing that is constant is the mentorship and the network of smart individuals,” he said. “And that applies whether you&#8217;re working in Web 2.0 or Web 3.0.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The brother of an <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/afghan-refugee-fatally-shot-during-attempted-robbery-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uber driver who was killed during an armed robbery</a> in San Francisco has published a letter to the ride-hailing giant demanding access to his brother&#8217;s Uber account, $4 million in immediate aid for the victim&#8217;s family and better pay for all Uber drivers.</p>
<p>Afghan refugee Ahmad Fawad Yusufi, 31, had been driving for both Uber and Lyft since he arrived in the United States three years ago via the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-immg-visa-afghans-employed-us-gov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Special Immigrant Visa (SIV)</a> granted to Afghans who were contracted to work for the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Both Yusufi and his brother Mohammad Dawood Mommand, otherwise known as Ilyas, worked alongside U.S. soldiers as interpreters for the army. Like many other Afghan refugees and immigrants, the two brothers were resettled in a low-income neighborhood in Sacramento, California, and would head into San Francisco, where incomes and fares are higher, in order to earn a living.</p>
<p>&#8220;We go to San Francisco for three to four days at a time because there&#8217;s more work, then we work and sleep in the car,&#8221; Ilyas told TechCrunch. &#8220;We try to get a room, but we cannot afford a hotel room. Because for one day, 12 hours of work, we can only make $250 or up to $300, and then if we get the room or hotel we cannot save anything for our family.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248293" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Yusufi and Ilyas represent the experience of many other <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/afghan-refugees-california-high-housing-prices/620016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afghan refugees in California</a>, hundreds if Ilyas is to be believed, who have to leave their own neighborhoods and cities to find enough Uber and Lyft work to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the resettlement agencies tend to resettle SIV recipients in low-income areas, which are quite oftentimes far away from the city centers or places where they tend to make consistent money working for Uber, so what they end up doing is commuting a distance,&#8221; Noah Coburn, an anthropologist at Bennington College and author of &#8220;Under Contract: The Invisible Workers of America&#8217;s Global War,&#8221; told TechCrunch. Coburn has interviewed more than 250 Afghan immigrants who recently moved to the States under SIVs, and said about half of them have worked for Uber and Lyft. &#8220;I think from Sacramento to San Francisco is sort of the extreme one but I&#8217;ve heard of other ones around LA and in the San Diego area as well where they&#8217;ll often work 16 hours straight.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Yusufi and other Afghan Uber/Lyft drivers would often congregate in certain areas throughout the city where they could find free parking so they could rest, sleep or eat &#8212; usually around parks, 24 Hour Fitness gyms or Safeway supermarkets, according to Ilyas. It might have been on one of these breaks, which took place around 5 a.m. on November 28 on the corner of Cesar Chavez and Portero Avenue, that Yusufi was shot and killed. He was with a fellow Uber/Lyft driver at the time, who was also robbed of his wallet and phone. </span></p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to the San Francisco Police Department to obtain a police record of the incident, but because the case is still active, the SFPD said it was unable to share more details other than <a href="https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/news/san-francisco-police-investigate-potrero-avenue-homicide-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what it had originally published</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch that Yusufi did not appear to be active, meaning his Uber app might not have been open, during the time of the shooting, and that he had last taken a trip the night before. Ilyas and his brother&#8217;s family said they requested access to Yusufi&#8217;s Uber account so they could learn more about his last few hours, but that Uber has still not provided access.</p>
<p>Uber said it had been in touch with the family to offer condolences and is working to provide access to the account</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the time my brother worked for Uber, not Lyft,&#8221; said Ilyas. &#8220;We have access to his Lyft, but Uber doesn&#8217;t let us open his account and get information to see how many hours he worked, when he took a break or stopped to sleep. They don&#8217;t want to help us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uber says he wasn&#8217;t working at the time, but how is that?&#8221; continued Ilyas. &#8220;He lives in Sacramento. When he goes to San Francisco he goes for work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Determining whether or not Yusufi was working for Uber at the time is a tricky business. Uber often doesn&#8217;t consider &#8220;inactive&#8221; time, when a driver is not actively driving to a passenger or completing a ride, to be time spent on the clock. Many gig workers say this type of definition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">leads to unfair and inadequate pay</a> because it doesn&#8217;t account for the time drivers spend waiting for a customer, driving around in search of customers and just taking a break. App-based gig companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash say they use this model of only paying drivers for active time because it allows drivers to be flexible and use multiple apps at once.</p>
<p>It is to keep precisely this distinction that those companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars last year campaigning for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">Proposition 22, a ballot measure that was passed in California in November 2020</a>, which allowed app-based companies like Uber and Lyft to continue classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees.</p>
<p>This proposition was in part a response to a 2019 worker classification bill, Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5), that impacts who is entitled to coverage under California labor law. It was under AB 5 that the California courts determined Uber drivers are &#8220;employees,&#8221; which would mean they&#8217;d have access to things like paid sick leave, mandatory breaks and workers&#8217; compensation in the event of injury or accident on the job. California&#8217;s labor laws also include <a href="https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/workerscomp/benefits/death-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">death benefits</a>, which include burial expenses and cash benefits to the dependents that the deceased worker supported. <span class="Apple-converted-space">Yusufi is survived by his wife, who does not speak English, and three children, including a four-month-old daughter. </span></p>
<p>Prop 22 also provides death benefits and insurance protection for injuries incurred, at the same rates as California workers&#8217; compensation, but the key distinction is that it only applies to the time an app-based driver is on the app looking for or actively engaged in performing a trip or delivery, according an Uber spokesperson.</p>
<p>In August, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/a-california-judge-just-struck-down-prop-22-now-what/">California superior court judge ruled Prop 22 unconstitutional</a>, rendering it unenforceable; however, because supporters appealed the ruling, it is stayed pending appeal. That means for the moment, at least, Prop 22 is still in effect, according to William B. Gould IV, a professor of law at Stanford Law School and author of &#8220;For Labor to Build Upon: Wars, Depression and Pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the appeal is not granted, then Yusufi&#8217;s family might have a case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without providing a legal opinion, I believe that a persuasive argument can be made that since Uber drivers are now classified as employees, Uber would be responsible for compensating for work-related injuries,&#8221; Samantha J. Prince, assistant professor of law at Penn State Dickinson Law, told TechCrunch. &#8220;If that part is proven, then a court would have to determine whether this tragic death is a work-related injury.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether or not it falls to Uber to recompense Yusufi&#8217;s family is up for debate. Coburn says the U.S. military should share some of that financial burden.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;If you think about the trillions that the U.S. invests in the [Department of Veterans Affairs] and in long-term health care and the GI Bill, educational support for those that went to war, which I think is a fine thing, the investment for contractors is zero,&#8221; said Coburn. &#8220;And then you had senators and Congresspeople who felt bad about that, as they should have, and so they designed the SIV program to give these Afghans a visa. But what they did was they gave them a visa and they gave them close to nothing. So there was no retraining. There was no work to find jobs. So the resettlement agencies certainly share some of the blame, but I think this is sort of a wider governmental failure to see the big picture.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Many ride-hail drivers, immigrant or not, come to the apps because they think they&#8217;ll be able to make a lot of money, but find that having to cover the costs of gas and auto repairs just ends up sucking them into working more hours to make payments, all the while they&#8217;re not building out resumes that could help them find more stable work in the future. </span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Uber pledged to support <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/supporting-afghan-refugees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Afghan refugees</span></a>, yet your company pays wages so low and sustains such precarious working conditions that hundreds of Afghan drivers drive from Sacramento to San Francisco each week and sleep in their cars in unsafe environments &#8212; just to earn enough each week to provide for their families,&#8221; wrote Ilyas in his open letter to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, SVP and chief legal officer Tony West and SVP of marketing and public affairs Jill Hazelbaker. &#8220;My brother and I did the same. And now after all the work we did for your company, you are turning your backs on us in our time of need.&#8221;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/helping-ahmad-fawad-yusufis-family?qid=1e7cdf98d9c38e0d614da60a6ee6d80e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoFundMe</a> has been set up for Yusufi&#8217;s family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe-based vertical farming firm Infarm this week<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/infarm-raises-200m-to-accelerate-global-expansion-of-climate-resilient-vertical-farms-301445604.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> announced a $200 million Series D</a>. The round, led by the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/infarm-raises-170m-in-equity-and-debt/">last year’s $170 million raise.</a> It pushes the company’s total funding to north of $600 million, while placing its valuation “well” north of $1 bililion, earning its place as Europe’s first vertical farming unicorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building a global farming network of our climate-resilient vertical farms is a core mission at Infarm, which is why we&#8217;re excited to announce this latest funding round,” co-founder and CEO Erez Galonska said in a release. “This strategic investment will support our rapid global expansion and bolster our R&amp;D so that we can grow more varieties of crops close to consumers across Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East. It&#8217;s another step towards meeting our ambition of growing the entire fruit and vegetable basket in the near future, providing premium products at affordable prices to everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the funding will go toward Infarm’s international expansion plans, with sights set on the U.S., Canada, Japan and additional parts of Europe. The company is also set to spread into more Asia-Pacific markets and the Middle East.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248800" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>QIA’s involvement in this round is no doubt a big driver in the latter. As part of the deal, the company announcement plans for a Qatar grow center, set to grow tomatoes, strawberries and other fruits in the region. Fruits have been a big push for many vertical farming companies, as they look to move beyond the standard leafy greens and herbs that have long been their bread and butter, due to the relative ease with which they can be grown in controlled indoor settings.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a responsible, long-term investor, QIA&#8217;s purpose is to create value for future generations. We see vertical farming as a way to enhance food security in every part of the world,” QIA’s Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud said in the same release. “We look forward to working with Infarm to develop their first Growing Centre in Qatar, which will contribute to Qatar&#8217;s own food security and economic diversification.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vertical farming certainly makes sense for the region, affording growers the ability to produce crops in climate-controlled buildings, with far less water than standard farming. In 2018, Crop One announced a 130,000-square-foot farming facility set to open in the UAE. Of course, going forward, such concerns certainly won&#8217;t be relegated to a single region.</p>

		<a href="https://www.7wireventures.com/team/alyssa-jaffee/">Alyssa Jaffee</a> is a partner at <a href="https://www.7wireventures.com/">7wireVentures</a>, a digital health-focused venture capital firm, where she focuses on investments that empower consumers to become better stewards of their heath.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">This was a record-breaking year for private investment across digital health. Investors <a href="https://rockhealth.com/insights/q3-2021-digital-health-funding-to-20b-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poured billions of dollars into digital health solutions</a> with great promise of driving innovation in a highly antiquated and inefficient industry.</p>
<p>While digital health has captivated the attention of investors and received validation from consumers, providers and healthcare stakeholders, early-stage entrepreneurs are being required to address the highly complicated yet mission-critical question: How can I show value and ROI?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The problems these companies are addressing are enormous, and the potential to help consumers and their families is even greater — key metrics that shouldn’t be overlooked.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>With any new innovation, proving out a financially substantiated ROI case requires a combination of time and data, and digital health is no exception. In healthcare, proving ROI ultimately means calculating how much a digital health solution has either <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.20173633v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved in outcomes</a> or <a href="https://transcarent.ai/posts/surgical-study-savings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">realized in cost savings</a> for the sponsoring organization and its members.</p>
<p>While a claims-based ROI analysis is a crucial long-term measurement of success, industrywide innovation will require stakeholders across the ecosystem to initially think creatively and consider proxies for demonstrating value early on. Rather than allowing claims data to be an inhibitor of innovation, investors must reframe their focus on the long-term direction of the business, the value delivered for the end user and the broader impact of the company on the healthcare system as a whole.</p>
<p>Three key questions can help reshape measurement and investment in early-stage startups:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem being solved?</li>
<li>What can be measured to identify early indicators of success?</li>
<li>Why (and how) is the experience delivered so much better than the status quo?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is the problem being solved?</h2>
<p>Digital health solutions are solving some of the biggest challenges facing our society today. Take access to mental health care, for example. During the COVID-19 pandemic, about <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four in 10 adults</a> in the U.S. reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OpenX, an advertising tech company, will pay $2 million to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations that the company violated federal children’s privacy law.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/ecf_1-_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the FTC alleges that OpenX violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal information from children under 13 without obtaining parental content.</p>
<p>The California-based company is also accused of knowingly collecting information from hundreds of apps marketed for children, toddlers and for preschool learning, before passing this data — including granular location data, IP addresses and unique device identifiers — to third parties that used the data for targeted advertising.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248773" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“OpenX has received millions, if not billions of ad requests directly or indirectly from child-directed apps, and transmitted millions, if not billions, of bid requests containing personal information of children,&#8221; the complaint read.</p>
<p>In addition to violating COPPA, the FTC&#8217;s complaint alleges that OpenX also violated the FTC Act by falsely claiming that it did not collect granular location from users who opted out of such data collection. Rather, OpenX continued to collect location data from some Android users even after they specifically chose not to have such location tracking data collected, according to the FTC.</p>
<p>“OpenX secretly collected location data and opened the door to privacy violations on a massive scale, including against children,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Digital advertising gatekeepers may operate behind the scenes, but they are not above the law.”</p>
<p>In a separate statement, FTC Commissioner Noah Joshua Philips said that the  order originally stipulated a $7.5 million penalty against OpenX, but the fine was reduced to $2 million due to the company&#8217;s inability to pay. The settlement also requires the company to delete all of the ad request data it collected to serve targeted ads and to implement a comprehensive privacy program to ensure it fully complies with COPPA.</p>
<p>OpenX did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but in a <a href="https://blog.openx.com/context-around-ftc/">blog post</a> addressing the settlement it called the data collection an “unintentional error”, adding that an internal review showed that “more than 99% of domains and apps were appropriately categorized.”</p>
<p>“We have reviewed and bolstered our policies and procedures to make sure we are fully COPPA compliant, and we will continue to follow strict criteria of both qualitative and quantitative attributes to determine a site’s or an app’s suitability for inclusion in our exchange,” the company wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.voodoo.io">Voodoo</a> has announced that it plans to make a significant investment in blockchain-powered mobile games. The company estimates that it represents a $200 million investment over the coming years.</p>
<p>2021 has been an important year for crypto gaming, with <a href="https://axieinfinity.com">Axie Infinity</a> popularizing the play-to-earn model. Some companies, such as Mythical Games, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/studio-behind-early-access-crypto-game-blankos-block-party-banks-monster-1-25b-valuation-from-a16z/">massive funding rounds</a> and are working on mainstream crypto games.</p>
<p>Tangentially, fantasy sports NFT games could be considered as crypto games. On this front, <a href="https://sorare.com">Sorare</a> raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/sorare-raises-680-million-for-its-fantasy-sports-nft-game/">$680 million Series B round</a> while Dapper Labs, the company behind <a href="https://nbatopshot.com">NBA Top Shot</a> raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/">$250 million</a> to go further in the NFT space.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Voodoo is currently best known for its hyper-casual games with 5 billion downloads and 300 million monthly active users. Voodoo games include Helix Jump, Crowd City, Hole.io and Paper.io 2.</p>
<p>The company has its own studios but also acts as a publisher for third-party game studios. Voodoo’s secret sauce is its tech stack to optimize distribution, average revenue per user and constant iteration.</p>
<p>And the mobile game expert doesn’t want to stand still when it comes to crypto games. Voodoo already has 10 internal studios working on blockchain-powered games. Next year, it plans to open another 20 studios focused on crypto games.</p>
<p>In 2021, Voodoo acquired 8 companies. So it sounds like new crypto game studios could come from acquisitions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There are few occasions in life when we experience a technological breakthrough that transforms industries. Blockchain will especially disrupt gaming, as players are already used to buying digital assets. This technology will give players true ownership of their digital assets, creating deeper interactions between players &#8211; collecting, trading, selling in game digital currencies and game assets &#8211; which will increase fun and engagement. This will also enable players to make a profit from their assets, opening up a new ‘play-and-earn’ model,” Voodoo CEO Alex Yazdi said in a statement.</p>
<p>So you can expect tradable NFTs in upcoming Voodoo games. They could have a financial value outside of the games as users could be able to buy and sell them on online marketplaces.</p>
<p>In addition to Voodoo’s existing stack, the company plans to work on a reusable blockchain stack to manage tokens, create NFTs, create wallet addresses, integrate with layer 1 blockchains (like Ethereum) and layer 2 solutions to reduce transaction costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple announced that it has officially <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=v868vy6e">released</a> Swift Playgrounds 4. The tech giant first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/ipados-15-announced-at-wwdc-features-improved-multitasking-and-improved-swift-playgrounds-support/">announced</a> the upcoming launch of the new software at WWDC earlier this year. With this latest launch, the software now lets users build iPhone and iPad apps directly on their iPad. It also allows you to preview apps in real time as you make changes to your app. Apple notes that developers are now able to upload their finished app to the App Store with its &#8220;App Store Connect&#8221; integration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swift Playgrounds is the best and easiest way to learn how to code,&#8221; Apple said in a blog post. &#8220;Code is immediately reflected in the live preview as you build apps, and you can run your apps full screen to test them out. A new open project format based on Swift packages can be opened and edited in Swift Playgrounds for iPad, as well as within Xcode on Mac, offering you even more versatility to develop apps across iPad and Mac.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248777" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248777" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2248777" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/swift-playgrounds-4-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/swift-playgrounds-4-2.png 1552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/swift-playgrounds-4-2.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/swift-playgrounds-4-2.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/swift-playgrounds-4-2.png?resize=768,540 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/swift-playgrounds-4-2.png?resize=680,478 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/swift-playgrounds-4-2.png?resize=1536,1081 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/swift-playgrounds-4-2.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248777" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248763" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple notes that the software also includes inline code suggestions to make it easier for developers to write code quickly and accurately. There&#8217;s also an enhanced project-wide search feature that finds results across multiple files. The company also says the software&#8217;s Swift package support lets users include publicly-available code to enhance their apps. Lastly, the software&#8217;s &#8220;Snippets Library&#8221; provides users with hundreds of SwiftUI controls, symbols and colors.</p>
<p>The new app aims to make it easier for new iPhone and iPad developers to try out their ideas without needing to use a Mac. To take advantage of the new features in Swift Playgrounds 4, users are required to have iPadOS 15.2 or later. Swift Playground 4 is now <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492">accessible</a> on the App Store for iPad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Climate change is affecting the way farmers grow their crops, and Phytoform, which knows all about the harsh United Kingdom growing conditions, is out to make crops more impervious.</p>
<p>The biotechnology company with headquarters in London and Boston announced $5.7 million in funding, led by Eniac Ventures, to scale its artificial intelligence genome editing technology aimed at improving crops.</p>
<p>Phytoform was started by William Pelton and Nicolas Kral in 2017 while the two were finishing up their PhD degrees. CTO Kral was studying plant development biology, while CEO Pelton is a crop scientist.

<p><div id="attachment_2248155" style="width: 372px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248155" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2248155" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture1.png" alt="Phytoform, Will Pelton, Nicolas Kral" width="362" height="541" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture1.png 362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture1.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture1.png?resize=201,300 201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Picture1.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248155" class="wp-caption-text">Phytoform co-founders Will Pelton and Nicolas Kral. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Phytoform</p></div></p>
<p>“We are lucky to be where we are with genetics,” Pelton said. “You can do the whole plant genome for a few hundred dollars and synthesize the genome as well. Nic and I were PhD students and decided to give it a go, taking technology and applying it to some problems we see.”</p>
<p>Current breeding methods to improve crops usually take decades to develop, and genetically modified organism technologies are limited, he said.</p>
<p>Phytoform’s approach to developing new climate-resilient crops involves machine learning and genome editing technologies to determine the number of possible DNA sequence combinations in plants and identify new traits, while also reducing agriculture’s climate footprint. Then those traits are implemented directly into crop varieties using footprint-free CRISPR genome editing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanabandoim/2021/05/21/gene-editing-seeds-with-crispr-is-transforming-agricultural-biotechnology/?sh=694d1226163d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">success of CRISPR technology in agriculture</a> has been well documented over the years as a way to manipulate plant genomes to make them more pest and climate resistant and grow more consistent products.</p>
<p>Pelton and Kral say utilizing this technology for plants couldn’t come faster as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates up to <a href="https://www.fao.org/policy-support/policy-themes/food-loss-food-waste/en/#:~:text=Globally%2C%20an%20estimated%2014%20per,Food%20Loss%20Indicator%20of%2014%20%25." target="_blank" rel="noopener">14% of food globally is lost every year</a> and climate change will only get worse amid drought, heat and pest conditions increase in the next few years.</p>

<p>Joining Eniac in the round were Wireframe Ventures, Fine Structure Ventures and FTW Ventures, existing investors Pale Blue Dot, Refactor Capital and Backed VC and a group of angel investors, including Jeff Dean, Ian Hogarth and Rick Bernstein.</p>
<p>“At Eniac we are big believers in the future of sustainable agriculture with existing bets that include Vence and Iron Ox,” said Vic Singh, general partner at Eniac Ventures, in a written statement. “As the climate crisis worsens, we’ve looked closely at how computational genomics can be leveraged to reduce food waste and bring higher quality diverse produce to market. We were immediately drawn to Phytoform’s founders Will and Nick’s approach of using deep machine learning on plant genetics combined with genome editing to offer a portfolio of optimized produce to consumers.”</p>
<p>The new funding will enable Phytoform to expand its team and boost its work introducing traits in tomatoes and potatoes so that there is greater yield and fewer crop losses along the food supply chain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The co-founders say 2022 “is going to be a great year” for the company as it prepares to bring its tomato and potato program to market. They are also working on three other programs and have expanded their geographies from just the U.S. to Australia and the U.K.</p>
<p>In addition, they have focused efforts on partnerships with individuals and companies at the beginning of the supply chain — seed breeders and producers — and future plans to expand that to food producers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company’s initial business model will be royalty revenue from the sale of the seeds, but expects that to change as its customer base evolves all the way to the consumer, Pelton said.</p>
<p>Phytoform started the year with six employees and has now doubled its headcount, Kral said. In addition, it has achieved good technological growth with proof of concept for its AI process both in software and web lab capabilities.</p>
<p>“We still have quite a big process on the way to get the tomato program in the late stages of development, but we will continue to do more trials,” he added. “Current technology is taking a decade to generate new varieties, but we are proving we can cut that down.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Supply chains are made up of a web of carbon-intensive activities, and trying to nail down which company is contributing pollution along the way has been difficult to parse. <a href="http://CarbonChain.com">CarbonChain</a>, an early-stage startup based in London from some supply chain veterans, wants to make it easier to account for carbon every step of the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;CarbonChain is trying to track the carbon footprint of everything. And as far as customers are concerned, we&#8217;re specializing in <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/greenhouse-gases-epa">Scope 3 emissions</a> and industries where the most emissions are. And we automate that carbon accounting for companies,&#8221; company CEO and co-founder Adam Hearne told me.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s AI-fueled carbon accounting platform attempts to measure the carbon usage of every asset in the world, certainly an ambitious goal. &#8220;So we actually use a bottoms-up approach for every asset in the world that emits emissions, and that&#8217;s significant,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248709" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hearne acknowledged that companies will often ignore their requests for data, in which case CarbonChain makes best-guess estimates before sending them to the companies for confirmation. He said that in most cases, the companies are not disputing CarbonChain&#8217;s findings. That could be because it generally comes down to money &#8212; they need to provide carbon emissions information to their banks.</p>
<p>He said that the banks providing financing across the supply chain increasingly want to know the carbon position of the company receiving their money. Hearne cited <a href="https://6fefcbb86e61af1b2fc4-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/005/741/original/CDP-Financial-Services-Disclosure-Report-2020.pdf?1619537981">a study by CDP Financial Services</a> that found that the level of carbon emissions of a company is actually a good proxy for the stability of cash flows.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248722" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248722" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2248722" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?w=680" alt="CarbonChain map of CO2 usage across the supply chain." width="680" height="447" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg 1342w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/co2-map-visual.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248722" class="wp-caption-text">CarbonChain visual of carbon usage across a supply chain. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> CarbonChain</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;So what they found is that if you&#8217;re financing something, and it&#8217;s very high carbon, it&#8217;s usually because behind that investment is a 50-year-old coal-fired power station, and it&#8217;s outdated technology. So it&#8217;s quite unreliable, and so you might get brownouts on that grid. Therefore, the asset is operating 90% of the time and it could be 99% of the time if it was on a new solar-plus-wind-plus-battery failover system,&#8221; Hearne explained.</p>
<p>While the company&#8217;s tech to measure carbon usage could be more broadly applicable, the founders chose the commodities supply chain first because they see it as the world&#8217;s biggest polluter, and measuring that pollution is the first step in controlling it.</p>
<p>&#8220;CarbonChain’s granular, real-time supply-chain carbon footprinting fills the data gap so that climate-critical sectors, and those who finance them, can take action today,&#8221; Hearne explained.</p>
<p>The company raised a $2 million seed round at the end of 2020 in an investment led by Lowercarbon Capital, a fund that invests in companies like CarbonChain trying to reduce carbon emissions around the world. The startup also participated in the Y Combinator Summer 2020 cohort.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://continual.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continual</a>, a startup that aims to bring operational AI to the modern data warehouse-centric data stack, today announced that it has raised a $4 million seed round led by <a href="https://amplifypartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amplify Partners</a>, with Illuminate Ventures, Essence, Wayfinder and Data Community Fund also participating in the round. With this announcement, Continual is also opening up its service <a href="https://continual.ai/post/announcing-continual-ai-seed">as a public beta</a>, after testing it with a number of select customers in recent months.</p>
<p>The data warehousing space is vast but also dominated by a small number of players, like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, BigQuery and Databricks. This makes it easier for startups that want to tap into the data stored in them to build their own innovations on top. For Continual, that means providing businesses with an accessible tool for building predictive models.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248460" style="width: 962px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248460" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2248460" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg" alt="continual_architecture" width="952" height="378" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg 952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg?resize=300,119 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg?resize=768,305 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg?resize=680,270 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_architecture.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2248460" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Continual</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248439" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;[Continual] allows modern data teams to build and maintain continually improving models directly on top of their data warehouse,&#8221; explained Continual CEO and co-founder Tristan Zajonc. &#8220;The common use cases we see are things like customer churn, lead scoring, product recommendations, inventory forecasts, predictive maintenance, service, automation, etc. Essentially, Continually maintains both the predictive model and the prediction Using data from the data warehouse and writing the predictions back into the data warehouse.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248458" style="width: 361px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248458" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2248458" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg?w=680" alt="continual AI example" width="351" height="267" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg 734w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg?resize=680,519 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/continual_graph.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2248458" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Continual</p></div></p>
<p>Zajonc&#8217;s last startup, Sense, was an early enterprise platform that was acquired by Cloudera in 2016, while his co-founder, Tyler Kohn, previously built RichRelevance, a personalization service that was <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/algonomy-merger-report-1234704695/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> by Manthan System in 2019. In building those startups, the two co-founders noticed the high failure rate for AI projects in the enterprise. Most of the time, it takes a large team and lots of resources to run these projects, all while the AI infrastructure needed is becoming increasingly complex.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re moving from this era of big data to this era of big complexity,&#8221; Zajonc said. &#8220;We founded Continual to solve this problem and to radically simplify operational AI for enterprises. We realized that the rise of cloud data warehouses &#8212; the standardization of data infrastructure and the rise of the kind of the modern data stack more broadly &#8212; provided us an opportunity to reimagine and radically simplify enterprise AI.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Continual, data teams can reuse their existing SQL and <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dbt</a> skills. All they have to do is connect Continual to their data warehouses and then declaratively define the features and models they want to predict. One nifty feature here is that the predictions, too, are stored in the data warehouse, where they are immediately accessible to developers and analysts as needed.</p>
<p>The platform currently supports Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery and Databricks and the team plans to expand its partnerships with dbt and these data platforms over time. As Zajonc noted, the company has no interest in becoming a data integration platform, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting continually improving predictive insights from data is critical for businesses to operate efficiently and better serve their customers. Yet operationalizing AI remains a challenge for all but the most sophisticated companies,&#8221; said Amplify Partners&#8217; David Beyer. &#8220;Continual meets data teams where they work &#8212; inside the cloud data warehouse &#8212; and lets them build and deploy continually improving predictive models in a fraction of the time existing approaches demand. We invested because we believe their approach is fundamentally new and, most importantly, the right one to make AI work across the enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to use the investment to double its team over the next year and expand its platform to support natural language processing, personalization and real-time use cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working together at Uber’s risk team, Yifu Diao and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ming Fang came to realize that with the hypergrowth the company was seeing came fraud challenges. Diao’s first project at the company after starting in 2014 was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building a rules engine called </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/mastermind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastermind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fight fraud. That engine, he says, allowed risk analysts to build and rollout rules without the help of engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While it was originally built for fraud, it came to be used for other cases such as safety and customer support also,” Diao said. “It was making 10,000 decisions per second by the time I left.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Fang joined Uber’s risk team in 2016, there was a need to use Mastermind at dispatch time &#8212; when drivers and riders are matched. However, dispatch was one of Uber’s most critical systems, and it had a much bigger scale than previous use cases while having a very stringent latency requirement. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248466" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ming [Fang] did enormous optimizations for Mastermind, which enabled this new use case and brought down fraud significantly,” Diao recalls. Mastermind is now used by hundreds of analysts and ops, and it makes real-time decisions throughout hundreds of user touch points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diao spent his last year at Uber working on a lending product, which also made use of Mastermind for underwriting. He then joined a credit card startup and realized that product also needed a rules engine to manage fraud, credit and compliance risks. However, that startup didn’t have resources like Uber to build such an engine in house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s more, explainability is important for fintech companies so that they can show regulators how decisions are made,” Diao said. “It became apparent to me that there was a need for a rules engine as a service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He immediately thought of Fang, who by that time was working at Google leading its Cloud AI Feature Store. The pair had been discussing a few startup ideas in recent years and they decided to team up to form </span><a href="http://sperta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sperta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this June (Sperta means “expert” in Italian) and build their own rules engine as a service. Its mission is to help financial services and tech companies automate decisions and manage fraud, credit and compliance risks.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the current rules engine offerings tout a no-code UI to build rules with a few mouse clicks the duo believes that won’t work out well “when the logic gets more complex,” Diao said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sperta’s main differentiator from others in the space (other players who have recently raised funding include Alloy and Unit21), according to Diao, is its expression language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our target users are analysts and data scientists, who already know SQL,” Diao said. “So we decided to build an expression language with similar syntax to SQL. We had great success with this approach in Mastermind. It made it possible for analysts to onboard in just one week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rules won’t perform well if they are not tested, explains Diao. And high false positives can have a real negative impact on growth. False positives can mean a loss of customers for financial institutions and companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are keenly aware of this,” Diao said. “That’s why we are enabling rule unit tests for sanity checks, backtesting for measuring the rule performance and percentage rollout for safely applying rule changes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To solve its customers’ “end-to-end” needs, Sperta is building a risk decision platform with the rules engine at its core. Sperta also integrates with data vendors, and it also allows analysts to transform features obtained from those vendors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just two months after its formation, Sperta raised $3 million in seed funding in a round co-led by Kindred Ventures and Uncork Capital that included participation from some angel investors. It is just now talking about publicly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customers can bring their own models too, and Sperta provides a clean interface for integration,” Diao said. “If decisions can’t be made automatically, the cases can be sent to Sperta’s case management tool. While models give us probabilistic predictions, rules give us explainable decisions and deterministic actions. We are really excited about helping the internet make better decisions faster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sperta, Fang said, makes it easier for customers to integrate models with its UI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> structuralize the data they want to use to detect risk and make decisions,” he told TechCrunch. “We can structuralize the way they use data to make sure their decision making is safe and cleaner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fintechs especially, a rules engine is very important at the onboarding stage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud is top of mind for all financial institutions, fintech or traditional. And with more transactions conducted online than ever, the possibility of fraud is also higher than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So naturally, fintechs and financial institutions in general are target customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitors, Diao said, charge on average about $1 a decision. While he wouldn’t get specific, Diao said Sperta will charge less than that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital mostly toward hiring. It’s still developing its product but hopes to have an MVP by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Kindred Ventures’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanyi Maqubela, Kindred Ventures believes Diao and Fang’s work at Uber was “groundbreaking” in the area of fraud prevention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A generalized, powerful version of a decision engine is sorely needed in today&#8217;s market, where software companies are making millions of underwriting decisions every day,” he wrote via email. “Software companies need a solution that is sufficiently sensitive to allow both customization, yet maintain compliance… Successful architecture is flexible enough to be modular, but secure enough to maintain compliance and ease across use cases. Sperta has already achieved this, within only months of being in market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andy McLoughlin, Uncork Capital managing partner, agrees that the founders’ insights from having built a rules engine at Uber give them “an immediate advantage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In our diligence we heard repeated dissatisfaction at existing solutions which aren&#8217;t able to offer some of the more advanced features that Sperta delivers in v1.0,” he wrote via email. “The competitors have done a good job at priming the market but we see a huge opportunity to deliver the correct solution.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Social hub Reddit filed to go public. You know what that means: It's time to ask questions.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/metaverse-startup-with-1m-in-2021-revenues-going-public-via-spac/">joked earlier this week that Christmas had come early</a> thanks to a particular SPAC deck providing us with some good fun. Ha. Little did we know what was coming.</p>
<p>Social hub<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/reddit-ipo/"> Reddit filed to go public</a>, TechCrunch reports. You know what that means: It&#8217;s time to ask questions.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Often The Exchange digs into topics and companies that we cannot claim seniority in. Not that we mind, but it&#8217;s worth admitting. When it comes to Reddit, however, we have bona fides. I&#8217;ve had my account since June 2008, and have been a casual user even longer, so we have the standing to put a few questions into the conversation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220368 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>TechCrunch has tracked the company since time immemorial. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/">Reddit raised a huge venture round at a roughly $10 billion valuation</a>. That means that its IPO is not merely the exit of one of tech&#8217;s best-known companies &#8212; it&#8217;s also a decacorn debut to help kick off 2022. Consider us excited.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll explore when we get our hands on its S-1: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We&#8217;re curious about content moderation costs, product expansion, the company&#8217;s revenue mix, how frequently governments come up in the filing, and what the unicorn has to say about crypto.</span></p>
<h2>Content moderation costs?</h2>
<p>A key element of the Reddit platform is independently-run communities that self-police. If you want to better understand what that means, post a Nickelback video in the ProgMetal subreddit. You&#8217;ll learn quickly!</p>
<p>But Reddit proper must have a material content moderation budget to keep scum and illegal content, as well as government and corporate astroturfing, off its platform. Such efforts will require both software and human inputs, so we presume that this particular cost will prove significant.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the past year, the company grew its number of Tier 1 enterprise customers by 10 times.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://elementaryml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elementary</a>, an artificial intelligence machine vision company, closed on $30 million in Series B funding to continue developing its manufacturing quality and inspection tools.</p>
<p>We last profiled the Pasadena-based company last June when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/elementary-robotics-is-making-its-quality-assurance-robots-commercially-available/">raised $12.7 million</a> in a financing round led by Threshold Ventures. Elementary’s tools enable customers to create no-code inspection routines and train models to inspect produced goods, parts and assemblies that were previously impossible to inspect manually, in a repeatable and scalable way.</p>
<p>With the latest funding, Threshold is back and participating with other existing investors, including Fika Ventures, Fathom Capital, Riot VC and Toyota Ventures, in a round led by Tiger Global. In total, the company has raised $47.5 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248275" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Elementary’s rapidly deployable hardware and industrial machine vision software are powering modern factories,” said Mo Islam, Elementary board director and partner at Threshold Ventures, said via email. “I’m thrilled to welcome Tiger Global as a new partner for the company as they scale deployments with numerous customers in manufacturing, consumer packaged goods and logistics.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248283" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248283" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2248283" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image002.gif" alt="Elementary, manufacturing" width="480" height="270" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248283" class="wp-caption-text">Elementary&#8217;s automated inspection tools. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Elementary</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Arye Barnehama, founder and CEO of Elementary, explained via email that customer demand and market timing were the drivers for the company to go after new funding. Over 250 millions inspections have been performed to date, he said.</p>
<p>In the past year, the company grew its number of Tier 1 enterprise customers by 10 times. At the same time, Elementary’s team doubled its headcount and rounded out its executive suite with the hiring of Milind Karnik as vice president of engineering, Monique Apter, vice president of sales, Krishna Gopalakrishnan, senior director of vision and platform, and Greg McEntyre, vice president of implementation.</p>
<p>Barnehama intends the new funding to expand Elementary’s customer base globally. He also intends to double the company’s workforce over the next year by growing in engineering, sales, implementation and customer success teams. The company will also invest in technology development for additional AI inspection capabilities and cloud analytics and reporting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“During the pandemic, manufacturing and logistics have undergone major labor shortages that were already beginning before the pandemic but were significantly increased,” Barnehama said. “As companies look to continue to automate without having to rely on expensive and hard to find engineering talent, our business has scaled because we are able to provide them with no-code AI solutions. Overall, we’re enabling customers to move towards industry 4.0 cloud initiatives, and quality/sustainability initiatives in a fast and easy path.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TikTok announced this morning it&#8217;s taking a new approach to its &#8220;For You&#8221; feed &#8212; the short-form video app&#8217;s main feed, powered by its algorithmic recommendations. The company already detailed how its algorithm works to suggest videos based on users&#8217; engagement patterns within its app, but admits that too much of a particular content category [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s taking a new approach to its &#8220;For You&#8221; feed &#8212; the short-form video app&#8217;s main feed, powered by its algorithmic recommendations. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/tiktok-explains-how-the-recommendation-system-behind-its-for-you-feed-works/">already detailed</a> how its algorithm works to suggest videos based on users&#8217; engagement patterns within its app, but admits that too much of a particular content category can be &#8220;problematic.&#8221; The company now says it&#8217;s working to implement new technology to interrupt &#8220;repetitive patterns&#8221; on its app and is also developing a tool that would allow users to have a say in the matter by letting them pick which topics they want to avoid.</p>
<p>The company explains in its announcement that &#8220;too much of anything, whether it&#8217;s animals, fitness tips, or personal well-being journeys, doesn&#8217;t fit with the diverse discovery experience we aim to create.&#8221; However, TikTok isn&#8217;t diversifying its algorithm because people are complaining of seeing one too many cute puppy videos &#8212; it&#8217;s doing so because regulators are cracking down on tech and questioning the harmful impacts of unchecked recommendation algorithms, particularly when it comes to teen mental health.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">Instagram</a> execs, along with those from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">other social platforms</a>, have been hauled into Congress and questioned about how their apps have been directing users to dangerous content &#8212; including to topics like pro-anorexia and eating disorder content, for example.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248711" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TikTok, in its announcement, makes mention of the types of videos that could be harmful if viewed in excess, including things like &#8220;extreme dieting or fitness,&#8221; &#8220;sadness,&#8221; and &#8220;breakups&#8221;-themed videos. While a user who shows interest in videos of this nature may find them interesting, the algorithm isn&#8217;t yet smart enough to know that directing the user to more of the same, repeatedly, could actually do the user harm. This problem is not limited to TikTok, of course. Across the board, it&#8217;s becoming clear that systems designed only to increase user engagement through automated means will do so at the expense of users&#8217; mental health. While Congress is currently most interested in how these systems impact young people, some studies,<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/not-youtubes-algorithm-radicalizes-people/"> though debated</a>, have indicated that unchecked recommendations algorithms may also play a role in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html">radicalizing</a> users who could be drawn to extreme views.</p>
<p>TikTok says it will also test new ways to avoid recommending a series of similar content when users watch and engage with videos in these potentially harmful types of videos. But it only offered examples of the types of videos it would limit, not a full list.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said it&#8217;s developing technology that will help it to recognize when a user&#8217;s &#8220;For You&#8221; page isn&#8217;t very diverse. While the user may not be watching videos that actually violate TikTok&#8217;s policies, the company said that viewing &#8220;very limited types of content&#8230;could have a negative effect if that&#8217;s the majority of what someone watches, such as content about loneliness or weight loss.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Another strategy TikTok plans to roll out includes a new feature that would allow people to direct the algorithm themselves. They would be able to use this feature to choose words or hashtags associated with content they don&#8217;t want to see in their &#8220;For You&#8221; feed. This would be in addition to TikTok&#8217;s existing tools to flag videos you don&#8217;t like by tapping &#8220;Not Interested,&#8221; for example. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, TikTok&#8217;s announcement today is only about laying out a roadmap of its plans, not the actual launch of such changes and features. Instead, it&#8217;s an attempt to hold off regulators from further investigations into its app and its potentially harmful effects. its strategy was likely informed by the types of questions asked of it both during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">its own Congressional hearing</a> and those of its rivals.</p>
<p>TikTok notes that the actual implementation could take time and iteration before it gets things right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to look at how we can ensure our system is making a diversity of recommendations,&#8221; the company noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanish proptech </span><a href="https://www.clikalia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clikalia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has secured $518 million in debt and equity in what is among the <a href="https://elreferente.es/ecosistema/las-25-rondas-de-inversion-mas-importantes-del-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest venture capital rounds</a> raised in Spain to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat entrepreneurs Alister Moreno and Pablo Fernandez founded the company in 2018 with the intent of providing Spaniards with digital options when buying and selling their homes. The iBuyer model that had proven popular in the United States by the likes of Opendoor and Redfin is also resonating with Europeans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clikalia is currently at a run rate of over 1,800 properties acquired, which represents 7x to 8x growth versus a year ago. It also has a team of over 600 people. It recently acquired Inmho, a Spanish property management company, in an effort to expand its capabilities in that area. The buy, execs said, will provide access to over 250,000 residential units.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247990" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles-based Fifth Wall led the approximately $70 million equity financing for Clikalia, which also included participation from Luxor Capital and Mouro Capital. Deutsche Bank provided the nearly $450 million in debt financing. Interestingly, Fifth Wall is also an investor in Opendoor as well as Loft, a Latin American real estate tech unicorn. Luxor has invested in U.S. iBuyer Offerpad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In line with the iBuyer model, Clikalia guarantees sellers “immediate” liquidity through an offer on their property as quickly as within 24 hours and, if accepted, a sale within seven days. In about 70% of the cases, Clikalia then renovates a property and puts it back on the market. Its mission is to leverage its “proprietary” technology to digitize a historically slow and painful home selling process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you buy a home from us, you have all costs in the embedded price,” Moreno told TechCrunch. “If you buy an old home, get a mortgage for an old home and then hire a contractor and architect for a renovation, that will cost you 4x more than it costs us. And you have to get a  consumer loan to finance the renovation. With Clikalia, it’s just one mortgage and you’re ready to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November of 2020, the company raised about $14 million in equity. Today, it operates in Spain and Mexico, with plans to open in Portugal in January 2022 and expand across Europe over time. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is planning to use its new capital to do more acquisitions, and, naturally, do some hiring. Currently, about 70% of its executive team are women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miguel Nigorra, partner and head of Europe for Fifth Wall, said his firm was impressed by the founding team, which had a previous successful exit as well as the market opportunity, as well as the company’s “amazing” unit economics and metrics “compared to many other companies in the market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Spanish market is one of the largest markets in Europe when it comes to residential real estate &#8212; with the equivalent of over 300,000 transactions per year,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s a massive market, and the process of selling a home in Europe and Spain specifically is extraordinarily time consuming, expensive and inconvenient. We’re excited about the technology angle Clikalia is bringing to a very old fashioned vertical in the real estate market.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.managexr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ManageXR</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> announced today it has raised a $4 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.rallyventures.com/">Rally Ventures</a>, with venture partner and previous lead angel investor Jay Borenstein joining the company’s board of directors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the latest funding, ManageXR will support its expanding </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">team and go-to-market strategy as the company has experienced rapid growth since becoming available to beta users in November </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2019 and officially launching in April 2021. The startup will continue to look for ways to expand its partner network of hardware and software companies across the globe, Luke Wilson, founder and CEO of ManageXR told TechCrunch. The company will focus more on large enterprises next year, he added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ManageXR built an enterprise </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">device management platform designed for VR and AR devices to serve as the core infrastructure for organizations. Its platform looks to scale enterprises’ XR deployments, enabling them to control remotely every aspect of their XR device fleet, including distributing apps and files, customizing the home screen user experience, tracking device health and usage, and more. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Device management solutions have been around for years, but until recently, there hasn’t been a viable option for VR and AR devices. We’re solving that problem for businesses at an inflection point in the industry,” Wilson said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Manage XR has facilitated more than 200,000 sessions to date across thousands of VR and AR devices used by small, midsize, and enterprise companies, including </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.xr.health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">XRHealth</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://us.brinks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brink’s</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The company also </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/managexr-is-now-preloaded-on-pico-vr-headsets-in-the-united-states-301419934.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recently </span></a><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/managexr-is-now-preloaded-on-pico-vr-headsets-in-the-united-states-301419934.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">partnered with</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.pico-interactive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pico Interactive</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a VR and AR hardware manufacturer, to preload ManageXR on all Pico devices in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We see a growing trend in companies delivering XR to their employees at a very large scale, evidenced by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://vrworldtech.com/2021/10/15/accenture-acquires-60000-oculus-quest-2-headsets-for-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Accenture’s latest deployment of 60,000 headsets</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. These organizations are using XR to onboard, train, and upskill employees, as well as unlock new workflow, using the metaverse as a new place to communicate, collaborate, and get work done,&#8221; Willson said. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Device </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">management is not a new concept to these corporations, and they understand how crucial this type of infrastructure is to ensure technology can be used in a scalable and secure way.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wilson founded ManageXR in 2018 with the intention of building VR experiences for pediatric patients in the hospital. At the time, the company had to develop its own rudimentary device management platform to deliver its content in the healthcare environments, Wilson told TechCrunch. In late 2019, the company realized that every other company, like ManageXR, would have to solve the same problems on its own, so it pivoted to focus solely on ManageXR in early 2020. Its team understands the challenges of using XR at scale on a deep, personal level, and it’s made a huge difference in how they </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">operate the company, Wilson said. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its competitors include incumbent mobile device management </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">companies, which build similar tools for mobile phones and laptops, and some device manufacturers. However, XR is a nascent and fast-moving market with different requirements that these companies are not equipped to handle, Wilson continued. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“These hardware manufacturers have created their own rudimentary device management systems, but they consistently miss the mark in terms of functionality and usability. These OEM management systems also force their users to only use one manufacturer’s hardware, which prevents customers from using the wide variety of hardware on the market,” Wilson said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its customers pay a monthly or annual fee per device, Wilson noted. Depending on the product tier, the licenses cost $7-$10 per device per month. Its premium product tier, which costs monthly $10 per device, is by far the company’s most popular offering. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Between the recent investments in the space from the largest tech giants and businesses now using VR and AR for everything from employee training to patient care to sales enablement, extended reality in the enterprise is at the cusp of mass adoption and we’re thrilled to have Rally Ventures join us for the ride,” Wilson said. </span></p>
<p>“XR is set to fundamentally change how we conduct business, collaborate, and experience the world in our professional and personal lives, but as adoption increases, so do the challenges that businesses face in successfully implementing their programs,” said Jay Borenstein, venture partner at Rally Ventures. “I am very excited to support Luke and his growing team as they accelerate how corporations can manage and benefit from XR devices at scale and ultimately bring enterprise-wide XR to the mainstream.”</p>
