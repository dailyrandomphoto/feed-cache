										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Barely more than seven months after its most recent funding announcement, <a href="https://www.yotpo.com">Yotpo</a> is revealing that it has raised another $230 million in a Series F round that values the company at $1.4 billion (post-money).</p>
<p>“Our round, in my eyes, it’s all about celebrating the future of e-commerce,” co-founder and CEO Tomer Tagrin told me. “Brands don’t need to worry about connecting the marketing stack anymore.”</p>
<p>Where success in traditional retail has been determined by “location, location, location,” Tagrin said e-commerce is “all about consumer attention.” To capture that attention, he estimated the average brand is using 10 to 14 different marketing applications, creating a “pretty horrible experience.” So Yotpo — founded in 2011 and headquartered in New York City — aims to provide all of a brand&#8217;s e-commerce marketing needs in a single, integrated platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To illustrate this, Tagrin described a marketer wanting to create a customized offer just for users who had both purchased a product in the past 90 days and left a five-star review. Yotpo allows them to do that with “just the click of a button,” whereas “that experience was just not feasible before Yotpo,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The platform currently consists of four main products — Yotpo SMS Marketing, Yotpo Loyalty &amp; Referrals, Yotpo Reviews and Yotpo Visual UGC — which integrate with each other, as well as with e-commerce platforms such as Shopify, Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Adobe-owned Magento and BigCommerce.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126712" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126712" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126712" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?w=680" alt="Yotpo CEO Tomer Tagrin" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126712" class="wp-caption-text">Yotpo CEO Tomer Tagrin</p></div></p>
<p>Tagrin said Yotpo still had money leftover from the last round but it decided to raise additional money to continue investing in product and marketing, as well for strategic acquisitions. (The company<a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/smsbump-joins-yotpo/"> acquired SMSBump</a> at the beginning of 2020 and Tagrin said it&#8217;s “70% of the way there” towards full integration.) Among other things, the company is planning to launch new products around customer communication and measuring a customer’s lifetime value.</p>
<p>Yotpo also says that it has now exceeded $100 million in annual recurring revenue, with the SMS marketing product growing revenue by 170% last year, while the loyalty product saw its revenue nearly double. Big brands like Patagonia and Steve Madden use the platform, but Tagrin pointed out that it’s also used by newer direct-to-consumer businesses like Princess Polly and has 30,000 paying customers over all.</p>
<p>“I like to say that Victoria’s Secret will die by a thousand cuts,” he said. “These are the mini-brands … the up-and-comer brands that are going to replace the incumbents.”</p>
<p>Yotpo has now raised more than $400 million in total funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yotpo">according to Crunchbase</a>. The round was led by by Bessemer Venture Partners and Tiger Global, with participation from Claltech Investment, Coin Ventures, Hanaco, Vertex Ventures, Vintage Investment Partners, Capital Group and others.</p>
<p>“Tiger Global has long been bullish on eCommerce as the future of retail, having invested in disruptor brands like Warby Parker and Peloton, giants like JD.com, and best-in-class SaaS companies like Stripe and Twilio,” said Tiger’s John Curtius in a statement. “We are excited by Yotpo’s approach to provide a unified marketing tech stack and the value it provides to brands and online shoppers in the process.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, London-listed telecom, Airtel Africa, said it was looking to sell a minority stake in its mobile money business in a bid to raise cash and sell off some assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm seems to have found an investor as it announced that</span><a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftherisefund.com%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Carichards%40hudsonsandler.com%7C6ae3a1d4e027462e848008d8e9d6e0ba%7Ca33bdb157e25438ab1fd5c523a8866f9%7C1%7C0%7C637516456381848512%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=2dTG9IzeXcyLuNLNqjUFwaHNh1bJElLyXg9NJ068CYs%3D&amp;reserved=0"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rise Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the global impact investing platform of investment firm</span><a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tpg.com%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Carichards%40hudsonsandler.com%7C6ae3a1d4e027462e848008d8e9d6e0ba%7Ca33bdb157e25438ab1fd5c523a8866f9%7C1%7C0%7C637516456381848512%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=jTHrPqvwzBi3CP9f7NPLUldmr5gxH%2FPpfoHZbZGKR10%3D&amp;reserved=0"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TPG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will invest $200 million in its mobile money arm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment will see the mobile money business &#8212;  Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV) &#8212; valued at $2.65 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC BV is an Airtel Africa subsidiary and the holding company for several of Airtel Africa&#8217;s mobile money operations across 14 African countries, including Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC BV says the holding company will use the investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to reduce its debt and invest in network and sales infrastructure in the respective operating countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal will close in two tranches &#8212; $150 million invested at first close, with $50 million to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be invested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at second close</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the deal&#8217;s completion, Airtel Africa will still hold a majority stake in the business and is exploring the opportunity to take the business public within the next four years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our markets afford the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market potential for mobile money services to meet the needs of the tens of millions of customers in Africa who have little or no access to banking and financial services, and this demand is driving growth,&#8221; Airtel Africa CEO Raghunath Mandava said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With today’s announcement, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are pleased</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to welcome The Rise Fund as an investor in our mobile  money business and as a partner to help us realise the full potential from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunity  to bank the unbanked across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtel mobile money business, one of the many players driving financial inclusion across the continent, offers a range of services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include mobile wallet deposit and withdrawals, merchant and commercial payments, benefits transfers, loans and savings, virtual credit card and international money transfers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these services are present across countries of operation except Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the West African country, Airtel has gone through the route of partnering with local banks but has now applied for its own mobile banking licence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its most recent reported results for Q3 2020, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year on year revenue growth of 41.1% to $110 million, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> driven by 29% growth in the customer base to 21.5 million and 9.7% ARPU growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transaction value went 53% up to $12.8 billion ($52 billion annualised), and underlying EBITDA stood at $54 million ($216 million annualised) at a margin of 48.7%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC BV benefits from a strong offline presence of kiosks, mini shops and agents which tie with its core telecom business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a bid to drive growth this year, the business has struck partnerships with Mastercard, Samsung, Standard Chartered Bank, WorldRemit, among others, to expand both the range and depth of its mobile money offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than $5 billion in assets under management across its platform, the San Francisco-based The Rise Fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be one of the world’s largest global impact platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yemi Lalude, a partner at TPG who leads Africa investing for The Rise Fund, said that with financial inclusion being a global issue that is most acute in Africa, Airtel closing the gap between traditional financial institutions and the millions of unbanked Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We look forward to working with Airtel Africa to enhance their mobile money services, broaden its use cases, and grow into new markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this investment in Airtel Africa’s mobile money operations, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand The Rise Fund’s global fintech portfolio and continue to deepen our focus on improving financial inclusion in Africa and around the world,” she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.asteya.world/">Asteya</a>, a Miami-based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disability insurance startup that is geared toward small business owners and gig workers, launched today with a seed round of $10 million. Co-founder and CEO Alex Williamson, who was Bumble’s chief brand officer, describes Asteya as an “income insurance” startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/bumble-prices-ipo-at-43-per-share/">Bumble’s IPO last month</a>, signaling that former executives are already taking their cash and betting that they themselves can build the next unicorn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she was at Bumble, Williamson took medical leave. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Had Bumble not been so generous with me with medical leave, I would have needed disability insurance,” she said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2126769" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126769" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2126769" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alex-Williamson-I-Asteya-.jpg?w=453" alt="" width="310" height="465" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alex-Williamson-I-Asteya-.jpg 2017w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alex-Williamson-I-Asteya-.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alex-Williamson-I-Asteya-.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alex-Williamson-I-Asteya-.jpg?resize=768,1153 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alex-Williamson-I-Asteya-.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alex-Williamson-I-Asteya-.jpg?resize=1023,1536 1023w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alex-Williamson-I-Asteya-.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Alex-Williamson-I-Asteya-.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126769" class="wp-caption-text">Alex Williamson <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Asteya</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Williamson, 51% of U.S. employers offer disability insurance to their employees. The other 49% are left unprotected should something happen to them. In today’s changing workforce, many of these people are small business owners and gig or freelance workers. It’s this class of worker that Asteya is targeting with its first product. It offers up to $500,000 in protection through a one-time payout for a monthly fee that starts at $6/month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people get sick and need to take time off work to get back on their feet, worrying about how they are going to pay rent or cover any other regular financial responsibilities can be a hardship in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If your finances aren’t in order, you can’t focus on getting help,” Williamson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People not covered by disability insurance &#8212; once they fall ill &#8212; have the option of applying for federal disability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main distinction here is that disability insurance starts paying immediately, while federal disability only pays after you get approved by the government, but the process can be cumbersome and is known to take several months. Many people who attempt to file for federal disability on their own are often denied and then subsequently need to use a lawyer to get approved. And after all that, payments &#8212; which range from only several hundred to a couple thousand dollars a month &#8212; kick in six months after you’re approved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signing up &#8212; and getting approved &#8212; for disability insurance with Asteya takes minutes, the company said. Like many other startups, Asteya, through its hassle-free approach in a sector that’s known to be tangled in bureaucracy, sees an opportunity to bring humanity into insurance, Williamson said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.doctordisability.com/why-is-disability-insurance-more-expensive-for-women/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women are often charged a significant premium for disability insurance compared to men</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; which makes them a more expensive hire for companies &#8212; adding another unnecessary difficulty for female candidates. New York and Massachusetts are a few of the states that outlawed the policy in 2019, and following their lead, Asteya’s first product is gender-neutral, Williamson said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">managing general agent (MGA) and broker’s license, and through its MGA license, all policies are offered through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance heavyweights Munich Re and Lloyd’s of London. In short, if the startup doesn’t succeed, your coverage won’t be affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering Williamson’s contacts and those of the founding team members, they were able to line up funding pre-launch, and Bumble’s founder and CEO, Whitney Wolfe Herd, is an angel investor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include 2BF Ventures, Capital Factory, Cap Meridian Ventures, Northstar Ventures, Atrum, and angel investor Geeta Sankappanavar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is planning to offer a product for longer-term disability, as well as one that covers people with pre-existing conditions. “It’s an area we’re on a mission to cover,” said Williamson.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fireblocks.com">Fireblocks</a> has raised a $133 million Series C funding round led by <a href="https://www.coatue.com">Coatue</a>, <a href="https://ribbitcap.com">Ribbit</a>, and <a href="https://www.stripes.co">Stripes</a>. The company provides several products that let you store, transfer and issue digital assets. In particular, Fireblocks provides custody to institutional investors —&nbsp;it currently stores $400 billion in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>BNY and Silicon Valley Bank are also participating in today’s funding round. Existing investors Paradigm, Galaxy Digital, Swisscom Ventures, Tenaya Capital and Cyberstarts Ventures are investing once again.</p>
<p>Overall, Fireblocks has raised $179 million since day one. The company says it has yet to reach a valuation of $1 billion — it isn’t a unicorn yet, but not far from it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup doesn’t have a consumer-facing product. Instead, it sells its products to banks, fintech startups and other financial institutions. As interest rates have been close to 0% for a while, financial institutions are looking for a solution to store cryptocurrencies and diversify their balance sheet.</p>
<p>Fireblocks lets them do that securely. The company uses multi-party computation to handle private keys. When you create a wallet, cryptographic secrets are generated on your device and on the servers. Whenever you’re trying to initiate a transaction, multiple secrets are used to generate a full public and private key. This way, there’s no single point of failure.</p>
<p>The company has also put together a network of liquidity partners. You can connect directly with 30 different exchanges and initiate transfers from there. That’s why over-the-counter trading desks and market makers also use Fireblocks to settle trades across several exchanges.</p>
<p>Fireblocks also lets you issue and manage tokens. It can be particularly useful if you want to issue stablecoins, tokens that are backed by fiat currencies and don’t fluctuate over time against their fiat value. It works across multiple blockchains as well.</p>
<p>You can earn staking rewards on Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot and Tezos through integrations with <a href="https://staked.us">Staked</a> or <a href="https://blockdaemon.com">Blockdaemon</a>. There’s a DeFi API so that you can take advantage of the most interesting DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>The company also integrates with compliance providers Elliptic and Chainalysis for anti-money laundering reasons. The company can flag and reject transactions depending on a set of rules.</p>
<p>As you can see, Fireblocks provides plenty of integrations with the crypto ecosystem at large. Starting from scratch and building those integrations in house would require a ton of resources, especially if cryptocurrencies aren’t the core element of your business.</p>
<p>In many ways, Fireblocks reminds me of banking-as-a-service companies, except that Fireblocks focuses on crypto assets. And today’s funding round proves once again that there are a lot of investments happening in the crypto industry right now. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/paypal-to-acquire-cryptocurrency-custody-startup-curv/">PayPal acquired Curv</a> just a couple of weeks ago. And this acquisition is certainly helping other crypto infrastructure companies proving that they’re valuable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://saleor.io/">Saleor</a>, a Poland and U.S.-based startup that offers a &#8220;headless&#8221; e-commerce platform to make it easier for developers to build better online shopping experiences, has raised $2.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/cherry-ventures-iii/">Berlin&#8217;s Cherry Ventures</a>, with participation from various angels. They include Guillermo Rauch (Vercel CEO and inventor of Next.js), Chris Schagen (former CMO of Contentful) and Kevin Mahaffey (co-founder of Lookout).</p>
<p>Saleor says the injection of capital will be invested in further developing Saleor‘s headless e-commerce platform, including a soon-to-launch cloud product and GraphQL API for front-end engineers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2020 but with a history going back to 2013, years before founders Mirek Mencel and Patryk Zawadzki spun out the product separate from their agency, Saleor is described as an &#8220;API-first&#8221; e-commerce platform that takes a &#8220;headless&#8221; approach. The idea is that the platform does the back-end heavy lifting so that developers can focus on the front end where most of the value is created for users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saleor was born of necessity when our agency work at Mirumee Software required more modular, flexible and scalable e-commerce software,&#8221; Saleor co-founder Mirek Mencel recalls. &#8220;Most solutions for bigger brands came with proprietary baggage like vendor lock-in, slow adoption of new technologies and commercial certification programs. On the open-source side, we didn’t enjoy Magento’s developer experience and felt alternatives weren’t viable at scale&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="n1iFVrJZ9N"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/mind-the-gap-e-commerce-marketers-should-revise-their-tam-and-sam-estimates/">Mind the gap: E-commerce marketers should revise their TAM and SAM estimates</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mind the gap: E-commerce marketers should revise their TAM and SAM estimates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/mind-the-gap-e-commerce-marketers-should-revise-their-tam-and-sam-estimates/embed/#?secret=n1iFVrJZ9N" data-secret="n1iFVrJZ9N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And so Saleor was conceived as an open-source platform focused on &#8220;technical excellence and quality&#8221; that could deliver greater scalability and extensibility than existing proprietary software. By 2016, the product had grown from something Mencel and Zawadzki&#8217;s agency used internally into a platform used by developers around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could have stopped there, but saw brands pressing for more revolutionary front-end experiences,&#8221; Mencel says. &#8220;Decoupling Saleor’s core from its presentation layer was the obvious path to revolutionary front-ends. As difficult as it was, we tore down what was a rather good open-source e-commerce platform and rebuilt it API-first&#8221;.</p>

<p>Beyond their early headless conviction, the pair also came to the realisation that GraphQL delivered &#8220;more power, precision and developer happiness&#8221; than REST. Reasoning that most developers prefer &#8220;a few things done superbly to many things done well,&#8221; they committed exclusively to Saleor’s GraphQL API. &#8220;We have never looked back,&#8221; says Mencel.</p>
<p>In 2018, the original six-person team shipped Saleor 2.0. Now with a headcount of 20, Mencel says Saleor has a simple vision of developer-first commerce: open-source, GraphQL and &#8220;fair-priced&#8221; cloud &#8212; a vision that Cherry Ventures has clearly bought into.</p>
<p>“We are currently witnessing a paradigm shift with developers switching to headless commerce solutions, allowing more flexible, differentiated shopping experiences,&#8221; says Filip Dames, founding partner of Cherry. &#8220;Mirek, Patryk, and their team are at the forefront of this development and will enable innovative merchants to build state-of-the-art shopping experiences that scale across all consumer touch points and devices&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided to pursue venture backing as a way to increase the Saleor core team size and accelerate buildout of Saleor Cloud, which we’ll launch this year,&#8221; adds Mencel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cubyn.com/">Cubyn</a>, the Paris-based logistics startup that lets e-merchants outsource fulfilment and delivery logistics, has raised another €35 million in funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by Eurazeo and Bpifrance Large Venture, with participation from First Bridge Ventures and Fuse Venture Partners. Existing backers DN Capital, 360 Capital, Bpifrance Smart Cities fund and BNP Paribas Développement followed on.</p>
<p>Cubyn says it will use the new funding to double its team of 85 to more than 170 employees by the end of 2021, and deploy its service more internationally. First up is Spain and Portugal (launching next month), followed by Italy, the U.K. and Germany.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Impressively, the company will open a 25,000 square meter &#8220;automated&#8221; facility in the Paris area in the coming months as it looks to drive down costs and delivery times.</p>
<p>Originally offering pickup and delivery only, 18 months ago, shortly after Cubyn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/cubyn/">raised €12 million in Series B funding</a>, the company launched &#8220;Cubyn Fulfilment,&#8221; seeing it enter fulfilment too.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Described at the time as a fully integrated solution that covers the entire fulfilment process, including keeping stock in Cubyn’s warehouses, it set the company up to grow off the back of an e-commerce boom, prompted not only by the pandemic most recently but also the continuing D2C and marketplace trend. For example, marketplaces Back Market, Rakuten, Mirakl and Fnac are currently using Cubyn.</p>
<p>Its proprietary technology aims to streamline merchant logistics, &#8220;ranging from web apps to advanced optimization through algorithm and warehouse robotics,&#8221; says Cubyn. The result is that it claims to be able to operate a fully integrated fulfilment solution at a fraction of the industry standard cost. This has seen the company grow its gross merchandise value (GMV) from €30 million to €250 million in 2020.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cubyn is disrupting the traditional e-commerce third party logistics market from the ground up, offering a better, faster and cross-border service at a 30% lower price,&#8221; says Cubyn co-founder and CEO Adrien Fernandez-Baca in a statement. &#8220;We are also providing merchants with not just additional revenue streams, but with our international roll out, we are now opening up new markets for them, outperforming other options available in terms of cost and delivery speed by far&#8221;.</p>
<p>“COVID has accelerated the need for merchants to have a reliable, scalable and tech fulfilment solution,&#8221; notes Antoine Izsak at Bpifrance Large Venture fund. &#8220;We’re excited to work with Cubyn to scale their business across Europe in the next few months&#8221;.</p>
<p>Adds Fernandez-Baca: &#8220;Today 85% of our shipments are in France, 15% international. With the funding, the ratio is predicted to change to 50-50&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The adoption of financial apps is <a href="https://finovate.com/southeast-asias-fintech-boom-all-you-need-to-know/">surging in Southeast Asian markets like Indonesia</a>, the region’s most populous country. Founded by fintech veterans last year, Brick develops APIs that make it easier for tech companies to add identity verification and access financial data from their users. It is currently partnered with Indonesia’s seven largest banks, covering more than 90% of the country’s bank accounts, and plans to expand into all Southeast Asia countries.</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://theaseanpost.com/article/banking-southeast-asias-unbanked-0">three-fourths of Southeast Asia’s population is unbanked or underbanked</a>, meaning that don’t have a bank account or access to traditional lending services. Brick will serve them as well, with products like mobile wallet and telcos APIs that are currently in beta and slated for launch next quarter.</p>
<p>The startup, which is now used by 250 developers and 35 tech companies, announced today it has raised new seed round. The amount of funding was undisclosed. Investors include investment firms Better Tomorrow Ventures, PT Prasetia Dwidharma, 1982 Ventures, Antler and Rally Cap Ventures, and angel backers like TrueLayer chief operating officer Shefali Roy, Cred chief executive officer Kunal Shah, Modalku CEO Reynold Wijaya, Carousell CEO Quek Siu Rui, and the founders of Nium, Xfers, Aspire, BukuWarung, ZenRooms and CareemPay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brick was founded in 2020 by chief executive officer Gavin Tan, an early employee at Aspire, a neobank for small- to mid-sized businesses, and chief technology Deepak Malhotra, previously co-founder of Indian neobank Slice and a former PayPal engineer.</p>
<p>Brick&#8217;s APIs have been deployed by personal financial management, cloud accounting, lending, wealth management and neobank apps, and Tan told TechCrunch it also sees use cases in verticals like savings, stock trading and financial planning.</p>
<p>Tan said he began thinking of launching Brick while working at high-growth fintech startups in Southeast Asia, including Aspire, and encountering a lack of infrastructure that slowed product development.</p>
<p>“Without unified APIs like those provided by Brick, fintech developers have to spend months figuring out commercials, navigating differing tech standards and navigating differing data standards, before they are able to launch their app,” Tan said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126885" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126885" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2126885" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png" alt="A diagram showing Brick's financial API offerings" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Brick-Product.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126885" class="wp-caption-text">A diagram showing Brick&#8217;s financial API offerings</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brick and other fintechs have benefited from strong support from Indonesian regulators. For example, Bank Indonesia published open banking API standards in 2020.</p>
<p>Tan said the standards “represents concrete government recognition of open banking principles, including consumer ownership of data and the necessity of their consent to transfer and use that data (which Tan describes as “a core principle that all our products adhere to”) and establishing a common language for banks and fintechs that enables the adoption of embedded finance. It also laid out implementation timelines for open APIs, beginning with payment initiation APIs in 2021, which Brick will launch later this year.</p>
<p>Brick works closely with Bank Indonesia and Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority and is participating in Bank Rakyat Indonesia’s Sembrani Wira accelerator program.</p>

<p>The most obvious comparison for Brick is to Plaid, the financial API provider that helped enable the adoption of open banking and open finance in the United States, Canada and European countries. A key difference, however, is that Plaid serves markets where the majority of people have a bank account.</p>
<p>On the other hand, &#8220;in Southeast Asia, only 25% of adults regularly use a bank account,” Tan said. “For the 75% unbanked and underbanked adults, their data resides in alternative financial data sources.” To tap into that market, Brick is building APIs for alternative financial data sources, like mobile wallets, telcos, utility providers, e-commerce platforms, social security and tax offices.</p>
<p>The company is currently focused on product launches in Indonesia, and plans to start expanding into other high-growth fintech markets, including Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam, later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Years ago, Serge Salager, a Vancouver-based entrepreneur who&#8217;d taken a small company public on the Toronto Stock Exchange, was approached by deep-pocketed buyer who was interested in buying the business. Flattered but also nervous about who else the potential acquirer was talking with, Salager found himself scouring the web obsessively for news about other possible takeover targets, from changes to their pricing and features to job offers.</p>
<p>Salager was right to be paranoid. The buyer acquired a rival company. On the bright side, Salager had a new business idea &#8212; to create a much better service than existed at the time to track altered information across the web.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://visualping.io/">Visualping</a>, a now six-year-old, 16-person freemium service that monitors the entire internet for changes and has amassed 1.5 million users, an undisclosed percentage of which pay the company a monthly subscription fee based on how many web pages and keywords they are following. (Two searches per day are free; 660 per day will set users back $100 per month.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Journalists like the service as it helps them keep tabs on the people and companies they cover. Law firms use it to stay on top of changing regulations, along with other information. Employees of Apple use it to keep track of what is being said about the company and where.</p>
<p>The use cases are almost endless, which works in Visualping&#8217;s favor, as does its apparent ease of use. Users simply provide the company with a screenshot of a page or the part of the page they want to keep tabs on, along with any keywords, and Visualping then informs them via email as soon as a site has been altered or a keyword has appeared somewhere.</p>
<p>Visualping &#8212; which has a browser extension and says a mobile app is coming this summer &#8212; has also benefited from the pandemic. Indeed, in lieu of endlessly refreshing the sites of companies like Rite Aid and CVS, more people are learning to use Visualping to keep tabs on the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-tips-to-help-score-a-covid-19-vaccine-appointment-at-cvs-rite-aid-walgreens-and-more-11614594600">availability of  COVID-19 vaccinations</a>, thanks to mentions of the startup in recent months in the WSJ, CNBC, and Fox News.</p>
<p>In the meantime, like other data companies, Visualping is getting smarter all the time by applying machine learning to the information it&#8217;s generating on behalf of its users, insists Salager. It won&#8217;t, for example, alert someone when the banner ads on a page have changed. Or if a customer is tracking a major price change, Visualping can hold off on sending that person an alert until that price change meets a certain threshold.</p>
<p>Of course, with data comes privacy concerns, and on this front, Salager insists that Visualping is fully compliant with GDPR, the EU law on data protection and privacy. He says the company might some day serve up targeted ads to its customers based on their search preferences, as does Google, but that for now, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Visualping is instead focused wholly on building up new </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://visualping.io/pricing">enterprise products</a> <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">given that more companies have begun discovering its offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That&#8217;s also the vision that investors are funding, Salager says, sharing publicly for the first time that Visualping closed on $2 million in seed funding in December from Mistral Ventures, a Canadian fund, and N49P, and AngelList syndicate.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a ton of capital, he notes, but with the revenue that Visualping is generating, it&#8217;s enough to get the startup through the next two years, he says. And after that? We ask Salager if he sees a tie-up down the road, and whether he&#8217;d be open to acquisition talks, given what happened with his last company.</p>
<p>He does and he is, he answers candidly. While one scenario sees Visualping becoming &#8220;publicly traded,&#8221; another &#8220;good fit is Google,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;We believe we fit very well with Google Alerts, so maybe an exit to Google is something we try to do, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More details have emerged today about the European Commission&#8217;s legislative proposal for a pan-EU &#8216;digital green pass&#8217; to show verified COVID-19 status. The plan is controversial from a human rights and civil liberties perspective, given the clear risk of discrimination. But privacy and security experts are also raising concerns about the technology architecture that will underpin the system &#8212; which has yet to detailed in full.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">“The proposal does not yet meet the requirements of data protection and protection against discrimination,” said German Pirate MEP Patrick <span class="il">Breyer in a statement today</span>. “It does not ensure that the digital variant of the certificate is stored decentrally on devices of the person concerned and not in a central vaccination register.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The European Union&#8217;s intention for COVID-19 vaccine passports &#8212; or rather what it&#8217;s branded a &#8220;digital green pass&#8221; or a &#8220;digital COVID-19 certificate&#8221; &#8212; will show whether the holder has been vaccinated against COVID-19 or had a recent negative test or if they have recovered from the disease and have antibodies, Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said today during a press briefing to give more details of its legislative proposal for the &#8220;common instrument&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The certificate will make sure that the results of what it shows &#8212; the minimum set of data &#8212; are mutually recognized in every Member State,&#8221; she also said, adding that the aim for the system is to help Member States reinstate freedom of movement &#8220;in a safe, responsible and trusted manner&#8221;.</p>
<p>Justice commissioner Didier Reynders said the intention is for every EU citizen to be able to receive the certificate free of charge and ask other Member States to accept it. He said the Commission will largely not be regulating use of the pass. Rather it will be up to Member States to set specific requirements related to the common instrument.</p>
<p>He gave the example of a European country being able to specify that they would accept a vaccination status of a person who has had a vaccine that&#8217;s not yet been approved for use in the EU, for example. But Reynders said the Commission will be obliging Member States to accept pass holders who have been vaccinated with an EMA approved vaccine.</p>
<p>The Commission wants the system to be ready to use &#8220;before the summer&#8221;, he also said. However that timeline looks incredibly ambitious for what is a complex technical project that involves sensitive personal data being used for a purpose which is inherently controversial, given the clear risk of COVID-19 status being used to discriminate or unfairly infringe on individuals&#8217; civil liberties.</p>
<p>The digital certificates being ready means not only the Commission implementing/procuring any central components and ensuring Member States implement the necessary technical pieces at a national level for the system to work as intended but also getting the required legislation approved by the EU Council and Parliament &#8212; and doing all that &#8220;maybe&#8221; as early as June, per Reynders.</p>
<p>Asked during the press briefing if there was a &#8216;plan b&#8217;, given how ambitious the questioner suggested the Commission&#8217;s plan is, he said there is no other plan &#8212; as the only plan is to avoid fragmentation by implementing a common instrument to prevent Member States making unilateral choices over COVID-19 at their borders.</p>
<p>Still, the proposal currently leaves room for European countries to apply different rules, according to Breyer &#8212; who has also warned it could lead to discrimination by allowing freedom of travel to be linked purely to vaccination if Member States choose not allow negative tests to be accepted as an alternative, for example. &#8220;This needs to be improved,&#8221; the MEP suggested today.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the other hand, I welcome the fact that the retention of medical information after showing the certificate is excluded,” he added.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers avoided too much discussion of what Member States might do with the common tool but they confirmed the digital pass would be available in both a paper and digital form (although, again, Breyer expressed concern counties may choose not to implement the paper form, thereby discriminating against those who do not have access to a smartphone).</p>
<p>Reynders also confirmed the digital pass would incorporate a QR code to verify what&#8217;s on the certificate and check if it&#8217;s validated.</p>
<p>The Commission scheme shares at least one component with a system that was recently reported by <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/gadgets/ubirch-und-ibm-erhalten-zuschlag-fuer-deutschen-digitalen-impfnachweis-a-9f26439b-8fd8-4118-9221-eb8844946c69">Spiegel</a> as under procurement in Germany &#8212; which it said involves QR codes but also blockchain technology (with IBM and a local company called Ubirch winning the tender) &#8212; and which is intended to be compatible with the EU&#8217;s digital pass requirements.</p>
<p>There was no mention of blockchain during today&#8217;s Commission press briefing. Internal market commissioner Thierry Breton said only that the technical solution &#8220;is also part of trust&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we have worked with Member States so that we are now all together on the same page. We share exactly the same technology,&#8221; he went on, adding: &#8220;We keep of course the GDPR at very high level. We will not exchange data and the good news is that all Member States have shared this view now. And this is extremely important because of course trust is also when you will move from one country to the other one that everybody will know just with a QR code you will know what is on your certificate and if it is validated.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Asked after the briefing whether or not the pan-EU system will incorporate blockchain components a Commission spokesman sidestepped the question, saying only: &#8220;The gateway will link the national public key directories for the signature keys.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot yet tell you who will implement this technically,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The spokesman went on to say that the &#8220;trust framework&#8221; (provided for by article 4 of the draft regulation) will be developed by the Commission &#8220;based on the outline on which Member States agreed in the eHealth Network on Friday&#8221; &#8212; referring to<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the voluntary network of Member State representatives which was established by EU directive in 2011 to facilitate cross-border data sharing for an e-health purpose.</span></p>
<p>On <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/covid-19_en">a related webpage</a> the Commission also writes: &#8220;The eHealth Network has published an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/trust-framework_interoperability_certificates_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outline of the trust framework</a> needed for [e]stablishing the Digital Green Certificate infrastructure, and continues to develop mechanisms for the mutual recognition and interoperability of vaccination, test and recovery certificates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Further work is being conducted by the eHealth Network in collaboration with EU agencies, the Health Security Committee, the <a href="https://www.who.int/groups/smart-vaccination-certificate-working-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Health Organization</a> and other institutions,&#8221; it adds there.</p>
<p>The eHealth Network&#8217;s current outline for the &#8220;trust framework for the interoperability of health certificates&#8221; is available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/trust-framework_interoperability_certificates_en.pdf">here</a> &#8212; as a 16-page PDF (v.1.0, dating from March 12, 2021).</p>
<p>The document discusses some design choices and intended outcomes but does not provide details of the chosen technical solutions as decisions appear to have not yet been taken &#8212; despite the Commission&#8217;s goal of the whole thing being wrapped up and ready to run in a little over two months&#8217; time.</p>
<p>Pressure from southern European nations worried about the impact of the coronavirus on heavily tourism-dependent economies is one driving force for the Commission to scramble to roll out a common approach for mutual recognition of vaccination documentation. Although fear of fragmentation of the bloc&#8217;s Single Market is likely the bigger accelerant for the Commission. (It&#8217;s notable, for instance, that other Member States, including France and Germany, have previously expressed concerns over linking the right to travel to a pass. So how &#8216;on the same page&#8217; European countries are on this issue looks debatable.)</p>
<p>Also questionable is how trusted the technical underpinnings of the digital pass will be &#8212; as plenty of detail is still to be confirmed.</p>
<p>In the eHealth Network&#8217;s outline, a section on &#8220;data security by design and default&#8221;, for example, asserts that t<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he trust framework &#8220;should by design and default ensure the security and the privacy of data in the compliant implementations of digital vaccination certificate systems, ensuring both security and privacy&#8221; &#8212; but it does not explain how this will be achieved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The design should prevent the collection of identifiers or other similar data which might be cross-referenced with other data and re-used for tracking (‘Unlinkability’),&#8221; it goes on before adding: &#8220;Further discussions are needed as to the technological aspects and timeline for the incorporation of these features in the trust framework.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Another section offering an &#8220;overall description&#8221; notes that the EU trust framework is designed to be &#8220;largely decentralised&#8221;. However it confirms there will be &#8220;some centralised elements&#8221;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">: Namely &#8220;roots of trust&#8221; stored in a </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">common directory/gateway (aka &#8220;EU Public Key Directory/Gateway&#8221;), and the &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Governance model&#8221; &#8212; raising core questions of trust over those key elements. </span></p>
<p>On the EU Public Key Directory the document envisages the gateway &#8220;shall be provided by a public sector body, such as the European Commission&#8221;. But evidently there&#8217;s still room for alternative bodies to take on that role.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the outline confirms that offline verification will involve the use of 2D barcodes containing a digital signature used in conjunction with dedicated verification software that will periodically fetch verified <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">public keys. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While it states that o</span>nline verification &#8220;w<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ill rely on the UVCI [</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Unique Vaccination Certificate/assertion Identifier</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">] and it will be incorporated in the next version of the specifications (V2)&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>A section on presentation formats confirms that 2D barcodes will be used &#8212; but also raises the possibility of &#8220;W3C Verifiable Credentials&#8221; being utilized, stating only that a decision &#8220;will be made later&#8221;.</p>
<p>Harry Halpin, a CEO and research scientist (and formerly a staff member at the W3C) &#8212; who has been <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhalpin/status/1371911502173704200">critical</a> of the lack of openness around the technical design of the Commission&#8217;s digital green pass, and who presented a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00136">paper</a> last year critiquing immunity passport schemes that involved what he describes as &#8220;a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)&#8221; &#8212; is concerned the Commission is considering incorporating what his paper describes as &#8220;questionable use of blockchain technology&#8221; into the digital green pass.</p>
<p>He argues that use of W3C Verifiable Credentials in immunity passports would be dangerous to privacy and security.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technologically there&#8217;s ways to prove test results digitally without involving any global identity at all,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;If you really just want to prove with medical authenticity that I have &#8216;A attribute&#8217; &#8212; where this attribute is I have negative COVID-19 test in the last 72 hours or I&#8217;ve been immunized with a vaccine in the last year, whatever it is that you want to prove, there&#8217;s another form of identity&#8230; called attribute-based credentials. Which is a perfectly fine way to do it. Attribute-based credentials just prove attributes without revealing identity. You don&#8217;t need a global identity for any of these use-cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the metaphysical angle is that because of corona all my previously private health data should now be public but then just come out and say that &#8212; don&#8217;t hide it behind some blockchain nonsense,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Discussing the eHealth Network&#8217;s outline, security and privacy researcher Dr Lukasz Olejnik &#8212; who has also <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/privacy-and-rights-of-covid19-health-passport-certificates/">written about</a> the privacy risks and wider ramifications of vaccine passports &#8212; said the document raises some questions such as who will be the source of trust and whether there&#8217;s a risk of function creep related to the proposed design.</p>
<p>&#8220;This technical document confirms that the user&#8217;s ID will be bound to the certificate. This may mean that the passport would mediate a proof of ID,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Considering today&#8217;s proposal of a regulation it is pertinent to wonder whether a function-creep-like expansion couldn&#8217;t lead to these passports becoming actual proofs of identity in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Other than that, the eHealth document is descriptive but contains no details as to the future solution. </span>The source of trust in this system will be the key problem of interest,&#8221; Olejnik added. &#8220;It seems that we will need to wait longer for the details.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>During today&#8217;s briefing Reynders raised the spectre of future expansion from another angle &#8212; saying that while the digital pass would be a &#8220;temporary&#8221; instrument, and the legislation would provide for the system to be &#8220;suspended&#8221; at the end of the pandemic, it would also bake in the possibility of re-activation at a later point if necessary, such as in the event of another pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the possibility to suspend the certificate when the WHO declares the pandemic over. So this is dedicated to COVID-19,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m saying &#8216;suspend&#8217; but through a delegated act and with the European Parliament we could use this instrument if there were another pandemic. But basically we&#8217;re talking about a temporary solution with the Member States and with the European Parliament.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to prolong that,&#8221; he added. &#8220;When it will be possible for the World Health Organization to say that we are at the end of the pandemic we&#8217;ll stop with such an instrument. And of course we are just thinking about the possibility to reactivate the instrument later &#8212; but I&#8217;m not hoping that &#8212; if we have a new pandemic in the future. But that will be with a dedicated act &#8212; always with the Parliament involved in the process.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On the issue of function creep, Reynders conceded that European countries might seek to use the digital pass for other purposes, i.e. outside the Commission&#8217;s target of facilitating the free movement of EU people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But he suggested it&#8217;s no different to Member States requiring masks be worn or a rapid test taken as they may already do in certain situations &#8212; while emphasizing any such uses would need to comply with wider EU laws and fundamental rights.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;If there are other uses well it&#8217;s already the case you can perhaps use other things like masks that are also imposed. There are also test, self tests which are used by people. But if we go into using the certificate in other ways we have to see if that use is necessary proportional and non discriminatory and also compatible with EU legislation,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Of course we will examine the situation on a case by case basis but I don&#8217;t think we necessarily need to draw a distinction between the certificate and other measures for example rapid antigen tests, masks and so forth. These are other tools that have been used&#8230; We need to make sure that any further use is proportional and non-discriminatory and obviously in line with the rules on free movement.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s digital COVID-19 pass has been in the active mix<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/europe-is-working-on-a-common-framework-for-vaccine-passports/"> since January</a> when the Commission said it was pushing for “an appropriate trust framework” to be agreed upon by the end of the month “to allow member states’ certificates to be rapidly useable in health systems across the EU and beyond.”</p>
<p>It followed up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/eu-to-propose-a-digital-pass-for-covid-19-vaccination-test-status-to-help-safer-travel/">earlier this month</a> when it announced it was coming with a legislative plan for the pass, emphasizing its hopes of facilitating safe cross-border travel this summer. Albeit, those hopes look more fragile now &#8212; given the slow pace of the EU&#8217;s vaccine rollout in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The Commission president also warned today that some Member States are on the cusp of a third wave of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The EU executive&#8217;s plan to speed full-steam ahead with a digital pass to verify COVID-19 status remains controversial &#8212; not least in light of the still highly limited access to vaccinations across the bloc which only underlines the risks of the tool being unfairly applied.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Civil liberties concerns can&#8217;t be disconnected from &#8216;vaccine passports&#8217;. Nor will they be swept away by an anodyne rebranding to a &#8216;digital pass&#8217;. But there are now additional questions stacking up around the Commission&#8217;s technology choices for the common instrument &#8212; and whether the architecture of the system will live up to Von der Leyen&#8217;s tweeted promise that the EU digital green pass &#8220;will respect data protection, security and privacy&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For EU citizens to trust in that claim full transparency is essential. </span></p>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean the dispute is fully resolved, however. Uber said that it will calculate working time starting when drivers accept a trip, excluding the time after they&#8217;ve signed into the app and are waiting for a ride. A statement by the App Drivers and Couriers Union described the company&#8217;s new approach as &#8220;a day late and a dollar short, literally.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cym.bio">Cymbio</a>, a Tel Aviv-based startup focused on what it calls &#8220;brand-to-retailer connectivity,&#8221; announced today that it has raised $7 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>CEO Roy Avidor, who founded the company with Mor Lavi and Gilad Zirkel, told me that the platform is designed to help brands sell their products on any e-commerce marketplace that they want. Whereas adding a new market might normally require a cost-benefit analysis (&#8220;How much money will it cost me to set up this retailer? How much sales will this retailer drive? Will the margins justify this?&#8221;), Avidor said Cymbio turns the process into a &#8220;no brainer&#8221; with immediate integration.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the platform automatically handles all the differences between marketplaces, whether that involves the taxonomy of the product pages or the background color of the product images, as well as inventory syncing, tracking and returns. It allows the brand to fulfill orders using drop shipping — so the brand stores and ships the products, rather than the marketplace, getting access to customer names and addresses in the process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Avidor said that increasingly, brands realize &#8220;they need to be where the customers are.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll sell on every single marketplace, but with Cymbio, &#8220;brand perception and visibility&#8221; are the main limitations, rather than time and money.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126737" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126737" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?w=680" alt="Cymbio Founders" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cymbio-Founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126737" class="wp-caption-text">Cymbio founders. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cymbio</p></div></p>
<p>In 2020, the company says that its customer count increased 12x and now includes Steve Madden, Marchesa, Camper and Micro Kickboard. The company also says that it reduces the time to launch on a new marketplace by 91%, while increasing digital revenue for the average customer by 65%.</p>
<p>The company says the Series A will allow it to expand its sales and marketing team while continuing to develop the product — on the product front, Avidor said the team is working on &#8220;a no-code integration where anyone can connect to anything quickly, no developers needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding was led by Vertex Ventures, with participation from Udian Investments, Payoneer founder Yuval Tal and Sapiens co-founder Ron Zuckerman.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe deeply that <span class="il">Cymbio</span>’s technology will fundamentally change the game for brands that sell online, making long, cumbersome integrations a thing of the past,&#8221; said Emanuel Timor, general partner at Vertex Ventures Israel, in a statement.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to building a data science team, many companies fail at the first step — creating a job posting. These mistakes have been amplified in the age of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.datanami.com/2020/11/16/why-data-science-is-still-a-top-job/">increasing</a> <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/08/data-scientist-job-market-2020.html">demand</a> for AI and data science experts, <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-recessions-impact-on-analytics-and-data-science/">driven in part</a> by the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact, is showing no sign of abating. Many employers are failing to identify viable job candidates, much less interviewing or hiring them.</p>
<p>What’s the biggest obstacle holding them back? In our experience, it is often a poorly drafted job posting. And with the pandemic completely <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/2021-recruiting-trends-shaped-by-covid-19.aspx">stopping all in-person recruiting events</a>, hiring success hinges on an effective job rec. Previously tolerable mistakes are now fatal.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.thedataincubator.com/">The Data Incubator</a>, a data science training and placement firm, we’ve helped hundreds of companies successfully hire data science teams. Honestly, it pains me to see amazing companies undersell themselves in this area.</p>

		<blockquote>
			When it comes to building a data science team, many companies fail at the first step — creating a job posting.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Companies inevitably gravitate toward the same generic buzzwords, promoting themselves as &#8220;cutting edge,&#8221; &#8220;creative,&#8221; &#8220;collaborative,&#8221; &#8220;data driven,&#8221; &#8220;passionate&#8221; or &#8220;insightful&#8221; (just peruse <a href="https://www.indeed.com/q-Data-Scientist-jobs.html">Indeed</a> for examples of these lackluster postings). Or they delve into industry jargon, which may be lost on candidates who are not familiar with the industry.</p>
<p>To streamline the writing process, we recommend that clients break down their competitive advantage into three buckets: compensation, mission and tech. Only by understanding where their strength lies can they successfully market their job openings.</p>
<h2>Compensation</h2>
<p>Compensation is an important component of making a position competitive. Managers certainly need to fight to ensure their remuneration range is appropriate for their data science roles. However, budget constraints are difficult to overcome, especially given the ability of tech and finance to pay top dollar for these sought-after skills. How to combat this when you don’t have the same budget? Consider listing compensation in job ads.</p>
<p>If you’re one of (the majority of) employers who cannot afford to compete on salary, this will help job seekers understand what to expect. Neither you, nor a potential candidate, wants to spend hours interviewing just to discover that it would have never worked out because of compensation. Save yourself the time and frustration by listing remuneration upfront.</p>
<p>What if you are one of the few employers able to pay major-league salaries? Congratulations, but don’t throw away your hard-won budget! Companies develop reputations for compensation. Unless you are one of the <a href="https://medium.com/@paysa/best-paying-companies-for-data-scientists-7930d4b8c6a">select firms</a> with a reputation for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/10/22/15-data-scientist-jobs-that-pay-100k-or-more/?sh=309be96626c9">paying top dollar</a>, you will need to signal that to top talent. Otherwise, strong candidates may assume the remuneration is low and not apply, defeating the purpose of paying a high salary in the first place.</p>
<p>Obviously, listing salaries is controversial and there are <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/why-isnt-salary-always-listed-on-a-postin/">plenty of reasons</a> why <a href="https://www.macslist.org/money-and-benefits/why-employers-dont-include-salary-job-posts-what-you-can-do-about-it">employers are weary</a> of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2016/11/23/why-dont-job-ads-include-a-salary-range/?sh=7ce8766d7a85">listing salary ranges</a>. However, a <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/salary-most-important-part-job-ad.aspx">recent survey by SHRM</a> found that 70% of professionals want to hear about salary upfront and <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/press/">Glassdoor.com</a> reports that salary is the No. 1 consideration for 67% of job seekers. With all these benefits, employers should seriously consider being more upfront and transparent about what they are able to pay, if only to save themselves time and frustration.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>In the COVID-19 workplace, employees are finding themselves increasingly isolated. With work from home poised to stay even after the virus has dissipated, the risk of isolation will continue. Companies need to double down on articulating their mission and galvanizing employees around that. This doesn&#8217;t just start with employment but the very first step of the hiring process: the job posting. Emphasizing mission in the job posting will attract employees.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/">BMW</a> plans to have 25 electrified cars in its lineup by 2025 and it&#8217;s taking a few more steps in this direction this year with the launch of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">all-electric iX SUV</a> and <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/future-vehicles/i4-all-electric-vehicle.html">the i4 sedan</a>. Today, for the first time, the German automaker shared a few more details of what we can expect from the i4, its first fully electric sedan, in addition to sharing the first exterior shots of the new model.</p>
<p>At the top end, the i4 will have a power output of 390 kW/530 HP. Going from zero to 100 kmh will take four seconds.</p>
<p>BMW promises up to 300 miles of range, according to its own preliminary tests based on the EPA&#8217;s test procedures. Enough to go from LA to Las Vegas. That&#8217;s the same range as the iX will be able to cover on a single charge and a slight increase in horsepower compared to BMW&#8217;s new SUV. And while that range is less than what Tesla and some other competitors can offer, it&#8217;s still more than what&#8217;s possible with comparable all-electric Porsche and Audi models like the eTaycan and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/audis-new-2022-e-tron-gt-is-a-real-electric-performance-sedan-not-just-another-electrified-crossover/">e-tron GT</a>, which are in the lower 200s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2126583" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90416005-highRes.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126583" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126583" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90416005-highRes.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126583" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;With its sporty looks, best-in-class driving dynamics and zero local emissions, the BMW i4 is a true BMW. It makes the heart of the BMW brand now beat fully electric,&#8221; said Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales.</p>
<p>For now, we don&#8217;t have any pricing details or additional specs for the i4. It will become available later this year, so we&#8217;ll likely see more details in the summer.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHF3RHQCqsA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;The iX is purpose built, it&#8217;s spectacular and it&#8217;s a completely new BMW X product,&#8221; Frank Weber, BMW’s head of development, said at a press event earlier this week. &#8220;But what people are longing for is to see that we have a sport sedan that is fully electric. [ … ] And the i4 has everything it takes to have a real sporty sedan from BMW that is fully electric.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, unlike the somewhat quirky i3, BMW&#8217;s first all-electric car, the i4 is a standard, four-door sedan (with real passenger doors, unlike the i3) &#8212; something that buyers in the market for a sporty yet roomy electric car from BMW in the spirit of the existing 4-series will likely appreciate.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, BMW also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bmw-debuts-the-next-generation-of-its-idrive-operating-system/">version 8 of its iDrive operating system</a>, which will feature a new dashboard layout and visual design, with two curved screens. It will make its debut in the i4 and iX.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">covered an interesting round</a> for <a href="http://Copy.ai">Copy.ai</a>, a startup that employs GPT-3 to help other companies with their writing projects. GPT-3, or <em>Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3</em>, is a piece of AI from the OpenAI group that takes text from the user, and writes a lot more for them.</p>
<p>As part of the process of covering the Copy.ai round, I got caught up in the idea of AI-powered writing. I&#8217;ve long been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/01/bring-on-the-blogging-robots/">more curious than afraid</a> of automated writing. So when the Copy team described their very positive impressions of the GPT-3 AI writing tool to TechCrunch during an interview, I was intrigued.</p>
<p>To scratch this newly-formed itch, I doodled around this morning with a competitor of sorts to the Copy team , <a href="https://headlime.com/">Headlime</a>. And, <em>freaking</em> heck am I am impressed at what folks have managed to build around the GPT-3 technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sure, GPT-3 can add words to a prompt. But the technology can do a lot more than that. The GPT-3-powered Headlime managed to not only write some medium-good stuff for me, but also managed bring in concepts concerning my reporting beat that were in my head but <em>not</em> in the prompts I provided.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t do better than just show you what I mean. So, here&#8217;s what happened when I used Headlime for the first time, sans help.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the first thing that Headlime showed me, a language selector and a request for a description of the post that I wanted to write. I decided to push the system a bit by just telling it about a piece I need to write in light of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/olo-prices-ipo-sharply-above-its-target-valuing-company-as-high-as-4-6b/">today&#8217;s market action</a>:</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126244" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.14.51-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="557" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.14.51-AM.png 722w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.14.51-AM.png?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.14.51-AM.png?resize=300,246 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.14.51-AM.png?resize=680,557 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.14.51-AM.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></h2>
<p><em>Ha ha</em>, I thought, that will kick it in the teeth and I, a biped of intelligent meat wrapped around some calcium sticks, will feel grossly superior to the computer player. I hit go and then realized that I actually had to provide 500 characters of stuff, so I rambled for a bit to fill in required length:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126245" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.16.31-AM.png?w=651" alt="" width="651" height="638" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.16.31-AM.png 651w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.16.31-AM.png?resize=150,147 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.16.31-AM.png?resize=300,294 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.16.31-AM.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.16.31-AM.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.16.31-AM.png?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /></p>
<p>Time for the next step! Hitting the button brought up a list of possible headlines for the post I was helping create, which were honestly not terrible:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126249" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="596" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png 743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png?resize=680,596 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.17.30-AM.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Fair enough, yeah? At this point I was starting to become impressed.</p>
<p>I selected the first headline as it was my favorite and moved along. Next came the work to get an intro put together for the post, a process that involved the strenuous work of clicking a button:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126250" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png?w=604" alt="" width="604" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png 714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png?resize=266,300 266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png?resize=604,680 604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.18.19-AM.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>
<p>Again, <em>not bad</em>.</p>
<p>What struck me about these are not merely minor variations on each other. They are structured differently, taking various angles on what I was halfway talking about in the 500 characters of bilge I had fed into the system. I was starting to wish that I had given GPT-3 a bit more to work with up top, as it was trying its best after I had clearly not.</p>
<p>Intro selected, I was brought into a CMS of sorts, where our selected bits were included, and your humble servant was asked to do a bit more writing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126254" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png 1393w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.22.48-AM.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>I was happy to oblige, only for the system to stop me and offer to take over:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126257" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png 1393w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.23.50-AM.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Having precisely no idea what a credit is, or what two of them cost as I was on a free trial of sorts, I hit the &#8220;Write for me&#8221; button. This is what came out:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2126258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png 1391w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-10.24.17-AM.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><em>Look at how it finished that sentence I started, even after I used em-dashes!</em> The software gets the next sentence backwards, but is right back on the horse afterwards talking about how higher interest rates make exotic investment classes like venture capital less attractive! I was gobsmacked.</p>
<p>I will keep playing with the tech and the various software wrappers that are being built to productize GPT-3. More notes to come. But I wanted to pause and share my initial delight. This is <em>cool</em>. I can&#8217;t recall the last time that technology actually shocked me. But, well played GPT-3, you&#8217;re amazing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://seon.io/">Seon</a>, which lets online businesses fight online fraud like fake accounts has raised a $12 million Series A round led by Creandum, with participation from PortfoLion, part of OTP Bank. The funding appears to be one of Hungary’s larger series A rounds to date.<br />
 <br />
Seon is a fraud-detection startup that establishes a customers’ ‘digital footprint’ in order to weed out false accounts and thus prevent fraudulent transactions. Clients include Patreon, AirFrance, Rivalry and Ladbrokes Launched in 2017, the company claims to bave been profitable since the end of 2019, after experiencing growth through working with neobanks, esports, gaming, Forex, and crypto trading throughout the rapid digitization brought on by the pandemic.</p>
<p>SEON’s CEO and Founder, Tamas Kadar, said in a statement: “We’re extremely pleased to have completed our latest funding round, led by Creandum, joining its exciting tech portfolio. We feel we have found a like-minded investor to work closely with to pursue the significant global opportunity for our business as we continue to democratize fraud fighting.”<br />
 <br />
Simon Schmincke, general partner at Creandum, said: &#8220;At Creandum, we believe cybercrime will be one of the most serious threats of the 21st century. With SEON, we’ve found an anti-fraud solution that’s effective, affordable, flexible, intuitive, and clearly proves its ROI.&#8221;<br />
 <br />
Gábor Pozsonyi, partner at PortfoLion Capital Partners, added: &#8220;Seon is a fundamentally useful brand: it offers a solution to one of the greatest challenges of digitalization, not only saving hundreds of millions of euros for its partners but making the internet a safer place.&#8221;</p>
<p>SEON are seen as competing with Emailage, Iovation, Threatmetrix. However, SEON’s thesis is that social media is a great proxy of a legitimate user vs bot/fake fraudster, so it looks heavily at social accounts to weed out fraudsters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the funding round, Seon has brought on board the following investors as shareholders: N26 founders, Maximilian Tayenthal and Valentin Stalf; SumUp founders Stefan Jeschonnek and Jan Deepen; Tide CEO Laurence Krieger; Revolut ex-CFO Peter O&#8217;Higgins; iZettle ex-chief Product Officer Leo Nilsson; Onfido cofounder Eamon Jubawy, and ComplyAdvantage founder Charlie Delingpole.</p>

<h2><strong>What we’re missing </strong></h2>
<p>Take this article you’re reading right now. If TechCrunch let loose a Little AI  — essentially empowered machine learning — it could learn you prefer to read short, newsworthy articles in the morning and longer thought pieces at night. That learning informs a personalized home page, presenting you with bullet points upon awakening and feature stories at night — all without you having to laboriously enter your preferences or respond to pop-up surveys.</p>
<p>Little AI also learns that what your VC friend wants to see on their screen first thing is recent series funding announcements. A truly personalized experience is not only our expectation, it is the core component of the relationship between us and our content providers. And yet, it’s missing.</p>
<p>Let’s raise the stakes. There are multiple players in the split-pay space. A sprinkle of Little AI can teach a fintech provider that one consumer likes to finish paying off an item in less than six months and never wants any outstanding payment to exceed $250. It can also learn that they are open to revolving credit/product offers for an experience-related purchase above $1,500. This type of truly personalized financing enables both the consumer and merchant to benefit from a completed sale while lowering the risk of default to the credit provider.</p>
<p>Travel will be coming back in a big way, with more deals than ever. Little AI can jump in and learn how to make that experience far easier for consumers and far more successful for travel providers. Rather than showing consumers every single deal for every single location, it can take personal preferences into account.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lucid Motors has designed the battery packs in its luxury electric vehicle for two lives. The company, which is already experimenting with energy storage systems for commercial and residential customers, is also eyeing ways to repurpose batteries from its electric vehicles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Lucid is still years from having to contend with a large number of used batteries —  its first EV, the luxury Lucid Air sedan, isn&#8217;t coming to market until the second half of 2021 — the company is already planning how to give them a second life them in a yet-to-be-launched energy storage business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery-cell modules that power Lucid’s vehicles are identical to the ones that will be used for energy storage, making them well-suited for “second-life” purposes, according to the company. The company has already constructed a prototype of a 300-kilowatt hour stationary battery storage system at its engineering lab, Lucid’s Chief Engineer and Senior VP of Product Eric Bach told TechCrunch. The batteries in that system are new, but there is “no technical limitation” that would prevent Lucid from swapping them out with used batteries, Bach said. While Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson has previously discussed plans to eventually build energy storage systems like Tesla that uses new batteries, this is the first time the company has talked about second-life applications for the product. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have already initiated second-life pilot projects aimed at extracting that remaining value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bach explained the company will likely retrieve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">batteries used in Lucid EVs after they reach the end of their useful life through its dedicated service centers or when customers trade in their vehicles. Once batteries are returned to Lucid, the company would need to harvest the modules from the packs and run a quality check on them. Lucid’s vehicles have built-in sensors that provide data on each of its cars from the battery packs down to the module level, Bach said, which will come in handy when determining the health of each module. After physical testing, the modules could be ready to be placed in an outgoing product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage systems do contain some additional components. In a home system, that may include a DC-to-AC inverter, a cooling system and safety switches. The actual battery will remain consistent across Lucid’s products.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucid hasn’t determined how it will distribute the second-life batteries between home and industrial applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Personally, I feel in an industrial application, using these [second-life] modules would be more appropriate and easier because there, the key metric is really just dollars per kilowatt hour,” Bach said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In instances where a Lucid vehicle ends up at a car dismantler, Bach suggested there may be an opportunity to incentivize the dismantler to feed the battery packs back to the company. Even if that doesn’t happen, as the price of EV battery raw materials continues to rise, dismantlers will likely make their own business of selling battery packs to companies or recyclers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point – with no product yet on the market and with an expectation that it will be low- to mid-volume – Lucid has not started branching out into recycling materials itself, he said. For the moment, Lucid is leaving recycling operations to its battery cell suppliers, like South Korea-based LG Chem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But in the long run, I mean, we’re just at the start of our journey [. . .] and I can envision that in multiple years we will look into cell manufacturing ourselves as well as the full value chain for everything that’s needed to make the applicable energy storage devices,” Bach said. “So in the future, absolutely it makes a lot of sense as the volume goes up, you need to try to contain more of the supply chain and that goes back into a sustainable method of harvesting the raw materials.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bach said the company is laser-focused on the Lucid Air and the public may be a few years out from seeing a Lucid home battery system. Until then, the Lucid Air will come equipped with bidirectional charging capabilities, meaning the customer will be able to feed the power from her car into her house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Essentially, that is the first home battery system that we will have already,” Bach said.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what resources — in terms of people and capital — Lucid is putting towards an energy storage business. Such details are likely to remain scant until after the company officially becomes a publicly traded company. In March, Lucid Motors announced it had reached an agreement to become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">publicly traded company</a> through a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp., in what was considered the largest deal yet between a blank-check company and an electric vehicle startup.</p>
<p>The combined company, in which Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund will continue to be the largest shareholder, will have a transaction equity value of $11.75 billion. Private investment in the public equity deal is priced at $15 a share, putting the implied pro-forma equity value at $24 billion.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to bring the Lucid Air and an SUV to market as well as to expand its factory in <span class="xn-location">Arizona</span>, Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson previously told TechCrunch. The company plans to expand the factory over another three phases in the coming years to have the capacity to produce 365,000 units per year at scale. The initial phase of the $700 million factory was completed late last year and will have the capacity to produce 30,000 vehicles a year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is apparently pleased with how its Amazon Care pilot in Seattle has gone, since it <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-care-to-launch-across-u-s-this-summer-offering-millions-of-individuals-and-families-immediate-access-to-high-quality-medical-care-and-advice-24-hours-a-day-365-days-a-year">announced this morning</a> that it will be expanding the offering across the U.S. this summer, and opening it up to companies of all sizes, in addition to its own employees. The Amazon Care model combines on-demand and in-person care, and is meant as a solution from the search giant to address shortfalls in current offerings for employer-sponsored healthcare.</p>
<p>In a blog post announcing the expansion, Amazon touted the speed of access to care made possible for its employees and their families via the remote, chat and video-based features of Amazon Care. These are facilitated via a dedicated Amazon Care app, which provides direct, live chats via a nurse or doctor. Issues that then require in-person care are then handled via a house call, so a medical professional is actually sent to your home to take care of things like administering blood tests or doing a chest exam, and prescriptions are delivered to your door as well.</p>
<p>The expansion is being handled differently across both in-person and remote variants of care; remote services will be available starting this summer to Amazon&#8217;s own employees, as well as other companies that sign on as customers, starting this summer. The in-person side will be rolling out more slowly, starting with availability in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and &#8220;other cities in the coming months&#8221; according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As of today, Amazon Care is expanding in its home state of Washington to begin serving other companies. The idea is that others will sign on to make Amazon Care part of an overall benefits package for employees. Amazon is touting as a major strength of the service the speed advantages of testing services, including results delivery, for things including COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Amazon Care model has a surprisingly Amazon twist, too &#8212; when using the in-person care option, the app will provide an updated ETA for when to expect your physician or medical technician, which is eerily similar to how its primary app treats package delivery.</p>
<p>While the Amazon Care pilot in Washington only launched a year-and-a-half ago, the company has had its collective mind set on upending the corporate healthcare industry for some time now. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/amazon-jpmorgan-and-berkshire-hathaway-to-build-their-own-healthcare-company/">announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan back at the beginning of 2018</a> to form a joint venture specifically to address the gaps they saw in the private corporate healthcare provider market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway to build their own healthcare company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/amazon-jpmorgan-and-berkshire-hathaway-to-build-their-own-healthcare-company/embed/#?secret=YC9tmdwxBa" data-secret="YC9tmdwxBa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That deep pocketed all-star team ended up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/the-amazon-berkshire-hathaway-jpmorgan-healthcare-joint-venture-is-officially-ending/">officially disbanding at the outset of this year,</a> after having done a whole lot of not very much in the three years in between. One of the stated reasons that Amazon and its partners gave for unpartnering was that each had made a lot of progress on its own in addressing the problems it had faced anyway. While Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan&#8217;s work in that regard might be less obvious, Amazon was clearly referring to Amazon Care.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for large tech companies with lots of cash on the balance sheet and a need to attract and retain top-flight talent to spin up their own healthcare benefits for their workforces. Apple and Google both have their own on-campus wellness centers staffed by medical professionals, for instance. But Amazon&#8217;s ambitions have clearly exceeded those of its peers, and it looks intent on making a business line out of the work it did to improve its own employee care services — a strategy that isn&#8217;t too dissimilar from what happened with AWS, by the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ultra-precise cancer therapies! Human-like hair grown from plants! A way to potentially save the bees!</p>
<p>The spectrum of companies coming out of <a href="https://indiebio.co">IndieBio</a> has always been pretty wild, and its latest batch definitely doesn&#8217;t disappoint.</p>
<p>As the early-stage, biology-focused accelerator arm of SOSV, IndieBio gives the companies in its program $250,000+, mentorship and full access to a biology lab to bring their ideas to life.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When founder Arvind Gupta left the accelerator last year to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/leaving-the-3-2-billion-portfolio-he-helped-build-at-indiebio-arvind-gupta-joins-mayfield-to-create-the-genesis-consortium/">join the venture capital fund Mayfield</a>, Mayfield and IndieBio partnered to form the Genesis Consortium, which offers IndieBio companies an additional $250,000 in optional funding.</p>

<p>IndieBio initially operated solely out of San Francisco, with the accelerator expanding just last year to include a New York cohort that runs in parallel. The SF program is led by Managing Director Po Bronson, while the New York program is led by Managing Director Stephen Chambers.</p>
<p>With its Demo Day still a ways out, IndieBio gave us a peek at the teams currently going through the program. It&#8217;s worth noting that IndieBio deliberately invests very early — in many cases, even before it&#8217;s entirely clear whether or not the scientific concepts behind a company are fully feasible. &#8220;Our program <em>is</em> our diligence,&#8221; Bronson tells me. The goal is to prove out concepts — and figure out how to turn them into big businesses — for hundreds of thousands of dollars, rather than millions. &#8220;We&#8217;re biting off the risk, and de-risking it for the next investors in line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are the companies currently in each program, alphabetically:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cartediem.org/">Diem</a>, a London, U.K.-based fintech startup, has raised a seed round of $5.5 million led by Fasanara Capital, and angel investor Chris Adelsbach, founder of Outrun Ventures. Additional investors include Andrea Molteni (early investor in Farfetch), Ben Demiri (co-chairman at fashion tech PlatformE) and Nicholas Kirkwood (founder of the eponymous brand).</p>
<p>Diem is a debit card with an app affording instant cash access, traditional banking service benefits (debit card, domestic and international bank transfers), but also allowing consumers to dispose of goods for eventual resale. The idea here is that this feeds into the so-called circular economy, making Diem attractive from an environmental point of view. Some estimates put the amount of worth of goods disposed of in the last 15 years at $6.9 trillion.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: You have an old item of clothing, phone, book or bag, for instance. You load the item it into the app. The app makes you an offer for what the item is worth. If you accept, cash is loaded into your account immediately. You send the item to Diem, which is then resold. The incentive, therefore, is not to throw away the object and add to landfill, because you have now turned it into cash. Think “neo bank meets people who sell your stuff on eBay.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Geri Cupi said in a statement: “Diem&#8217;s mission is to empower consumers to value, unlock, and enjoy wealth they never knew they had. All of this while fuelling the circular economy and supporting the commitment to sustainability as our key value proposition. DIEM makes it possible for capitalism and sustainability to co-exist.”</p>
<p>Lead Investor and CEO at Fasanara Capital, Francesco Filia, said: “Fasanara is excited to announce our partnership with DIEM and Geri Cupi… [it’s] a new generation fintech powered by principles of circular economy and look forward to support its growth.”</p>
