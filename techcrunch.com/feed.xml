										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups are stories of feverish dreams and obsessive fears. Short of hearing it from the source, a glimpse into the inbox of a founder would be the best way to experience the travails they endure on the way to building a business. A customer finally makes a purchase, a VC invests or walks away, an employee signs their offer letter — all of the major and minor milestones of a startup are communicated via that now-ancient medium of email.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Current Klaviyo users may be surprised to hear that email was not a part of the initial product.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Email’s ubiquity is only part of the story, though. It’s also a symbol of freedom: The last social platform that remains relatively open and free from the clutches of a single monopoly owner. It’s a market rife with entrenched incumbents, but one that simultaneously continues to invite founders to find some new take on this venerable communications channel and make it better for everyone.</p>
<p>That was the mission that Andrew Bialecki and Ed Hallen undertook when they founded <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com">Klaviyo</a> back in 2012. What they perhaps didn’t bank on was just how long of a route they were about to take — or how many rejections they might find in their own inboxes from accelerators and VCs who never thought a new generation of email service providers could make it.</p>
<p>So they bootstrapped, kept things lean. They debated canceling dinners to pay the bills when customers churned. And along the way, they built a special startup that is today valued at a whopping $4.15 billion. Klaviyo is the story of how two scrappy, inexperienced entrepreneurs set out to build a lifestyle business — and ended up creating an email titan.</p>
<h2>Racing to the starting line</h2>
<p>Klaviyo’s origin story sounds a bit like the generic advice given by every book on entrepreneurship. Andrew Bialecki — he goes by AB — had a need that no existing company filled. So, he started a company to address that need.</p>
<p>It began with what he calls a side hustle: a website devoted to cataloging the dates and locations of running races. Bialecki had the technical chops to build it, but the data wasn’t already available online and he needed race organizers to provide it. That, in turn, meant he needed to let them know his site existed and constantly follow up to make sure they were using it.</p>
<p>“I realized I&#8217;m on the phone with people and it&#8217;s never going to scale. After a while, I was working on that while I was at another startup, and I said I have two options here. Either I can go all-in on road races, or all-in on the problem: ‘How do we help these businesses connect with the people using their software or products?&#8217;” recalls Bialecki.</p>
<p>By then, he already had a co-founder in mind. Bialecki had been a student together with Ed Hallen at MIT, but the pair actually met while working at Applied Predictive Technologies (APT), a Washington, D.C. tech consultancy.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;d read all those books on, hey, when you&#8217;re looking for someone to start a business with, you want someone with similar values who&#8217;s also complementary,” says Bialecki. “I&#8217;d known he was kind of interested in starting a company, and we had really complementary skillsets. I loved the engineering and design and product, and he was a big product guy too, but was used to working with customers and clients.”</p>
<h2>An email company that didn’t (initially) do email</h2>
<p>Current Klaviyo users may be surprised to hear that email was not part of the product that emerged. Instead, Bialecki and Hallen built a database to collect all the e-commerce data that was falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>“Once we really talked to a lot of e-commerce people, it was clear there were long-standing problems,” says Hallen.</p>
<p>Bialecki adds, “There are facts you know, like their name, their email address, their favorite color or something they told you about their birthday. But some of the harder stuff was, jeez, how many times has this person visited my website, bought something from me, what products did they buy and how is that trending over time? Were they a really frequent customer that dropped off the face of the Earth?”</p>
<p>As they spoke to customers, the founders realized that handling customers&#8217; data and making it useful to them was going to be critical to Klaviyo’s success. It just so happened that gathering data matched well with their experiences working at APT.</p>
<p>“We had a ton of experience stitching together data sources,” says Hallen. “We took that expertise and put it as our foundation. What&#8217;s the most broken, largest market, and let&#8217;s really tie data to it, not as an afterthought.”</p>

<p>What that required, in practical terms, was spending the initial months building a custom database to store the disparate data types that come up during e-commerce transactions — events, documents and object data models. Conor O’Mahony, who joined the company in 2018 as chief product officer and departed this month to become an advisor, says that the company’s early time investment in its database laid the foundations for its later success in scaling up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Email is the communication medium that refuses to die.</p>
<p>“Eventually, every technology is trumped by something new and better. And I feel that email is ready to be trumped. But by what?” <a href="https://avc.com/2007/05/what_trumps_ema/">wrote the venture capitalist Fred Wilson in 2007</a>. Three years later, <a href="https://avc.com/2010/04/social-networking-vs-email/">he updated readers</a> that other forms of messaging had outgrown email. “It looks like email&#8217;s reign as the king of communication is ending and social networking is now supreme,” he said. (To be fair to Wilson, his view was nuanced enough to continue investing in email tech.)</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Despite the competition, Klaviyo didn’t just break into the market — it has also achieved an unusual level of excitement and loyalty among marketers despite its youthful history.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Investors weren’t alone — marketers have also spent years anticipating the next big thing.</p>
<p>“It was SMS, it was YouTube, it was Instagram. Before that it was Facebook, then it was Snapchat and TikTok. I kinda feel like individually all those things are fleeting. I think people found: You know what? Everyone still opens their emails every day,” says Darin Hager, a former sneaker entrepreneur who is now an email marketing manager at <a href="https://www.adjustmedia.co/">Adjust Media</a>.</p>
<p>Email has an estimated <a href="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Email-Statistics-Report-2019-2023-Executive-Summary.pdf">four billion users</a> today and continues to grow steadily even as mature social networks plateau. Estimates of the number of nonspam messages sent each day range from <a href="https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/email_rep">25 billion</a> to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/">over 300 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly for a marketing channel with so much volume, there’s voluminous competition to send and program those emails. Yet, despite the competition, Klaviyo didn’t just break into the market — it has also achieved an unusual level of excitement and loyalty among marketers despite its youthful history.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not using Klaviyo and you&#8217;re in e-commerce, then it&#8217;s not very professional. If you see ‘Sent by Constant Contact or Mailchimp’ at the bottom of an email by a brand, it makes it look like they&#8217;re not really there yet,” Hager said.</p>
<p>How did Klaviyo become the standard solution among email marketers?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-origin/">In Klaviyo’s origin story</a>, we delved into part of the answer: The company began life as an e-commerce analytics service. Once it matured to compete as an email service provider, Klaviyo benefited from the edge given by its deeper, more comprehensive focus on data.</p>
<p>However, that leaves several questions unanswered. Why is email so important to e-commerce? What are the substantive differences between Klaviyo’s feature set and those of its competitors? And why did several large, well-funded incumbents fail to capitalize on building an advantage in data first?</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll answer those questions — as well as laying out the significance of COVID-19 on the e-commerce market, and how newsletters and AI figure into the company’s future.</p>
<h2>A positive Outlook on email’s longevity</h2>
<p>Email is one of the oldest tech verticals: <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contact</a>, one of the most venerable email service providers (ESPs), was founded in 1995, <a href="https://xconomy.com/boston/2007/10/03/constant-contact-completes-107-million-ipo-shares-up-10-out-of-the-gate/">went public in 2007</a> and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/02/email-marketing-giant-constant-contact-acquired-for-1-billion/">was taken private in 2015 for $1 billion</a>. By the time Klaviyo started in 2012, the space was well served by numerous incumbents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brands are emotions made physical. The clothes we wear, the media we consume, the devices we use — all signal not only to others what we value and see in ourselves, they also are a way to construct our very identities. Experimenting to deepen that bond has been at the core of the marketing profession for a century; its origins rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>There had always been one critical limitation, though: Marketers had to appeal to the masses. Radio, television and print media allowed brands to deliver only one message to everyone, no matter if their product conferred luxury or smart cost-consciousness.</p>
<p>On the internet, the masses have been shattered into ever smaller shards, shifting that marketing calculus toward targeted audiences and social network interest groups. Today, niche brands, large corporations and every business in between are reaching ever-narrower audiences.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Marketers who become expert at personalization, especially for existing customers through owned marketing platforms like email, will hold an edge over their competitors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Yet, advertising and social networks are competitive marketplaces. Over time, prices to reach niche audiences rise, and strategies that once worked become unviable. In 2021, these perpetual challenges are joined by two new factors: a fresh influx of new e-commerce brands and changing privacy policies on third-party platforms.</p>
<p>Klaviyo benefits from these secular trends. While the cost or difficulty of acquiring new customers may increase, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-business/">we looked at in the second part of this EC-1</a>, the cost of emailing an existing one remains much the same. Marketers who become expert at personalization, especially for existing customers through owned marketing platforms like email, will hold an edge over their competitors. It’s no longer about marketing to narrow slices of audiences — it&#8217;s about building an emotional bond with an audience of one.</p>
<h2>To a booming economy, now ad inflation</h2>
<p>While 2020 was a banner year for e-commerce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the early months of 2021 have brought about a new problem: Customer acquisition costs are rising, sometimes to a worrying degree. For instance, one company interviewed by TechCrunch that did not wish to be named said it has seen its return on investment for Facebook ads fall by nearly half in the first months of 2021. Such inflation has also been <a href="https://www.ecimediamanagement.com/eci-inflation-report-q1-2021/">predicted by firms like ECI Media Management</a>.</p>
<p>There are two possible reasons for this increase. First, an unprecedented number of companies are moving online, spurred by COVID-19 and worldwide lockdowns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many of the stories in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1">our EC-1 series</a> tell tales of startups in the wilderness hacking out green field opportunities. Klaviyo is a different breed of company: One that went into an established market and challenged powerful incumbents, ultimately finding success with a new, more data-oriented generation of email marketers.</p>
<p>As such, the lessons that it offers are, perhaps, more subtle; its insights bordering on common sense.</p>
<p>But as the saying goes, common sense to an uncommon degree becomes wisdom. Here are four pieces of wisdom I’ve gleaned from Klaviyo’s story:</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Lesson 1: Drama and quirk aren’t necessary for startup success</h2>
<p>Silicon Valley has become a showcase for oddity. Ironically, we all enjoy &#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; (the show) or &#8220;The Social Network<i>.&#8221;</i> Unironically, we toss around phrases like “the hustle” and “sweat equity.” Hot companies often stand out with stories of intense struggle and failure, a larger-than-life founder or a chaotic (and often toxic) management structure.</p>
<p>Drama and sizzle help companies stand out, undoubtedly. But are they necessary for success? Klaviyo’s story suggests otherwise.</p>

<p>The companies said in a statement that Arbe’s platform addresses “core issues” that have been the source of recent AV motor accidents, such as correctly identifying vulnerable road users like cyclists and pedestrians, detecting stationary objects, and removing false alarms caused by ambiguities in the radar image.</p>
<p>It does so using proprietary 2K-resolution, 30 frames per second imaging technology, that the company says is 100 times more detailed than any other radar currently on the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Arbe already has partnerships with five tier one automotive supplier customers, and with chipmaker NVIDIA, CEO Kobi Marenko said in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816696/000121390021016440/ea137987ex99-2_industrial.htm">a recent webcast</a>.

<p>AutoX, whose backers include Alibaba, Shanghai Motors and MediaTek, has been at the forefront of AV deployment in China. It was the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/autox-removes-safety-drivers/">first company in China</a> to test AVs on public roads without safety drivers, in Shenzhen, one of the country’s largest cities and the location of the company’s headquarters. And it launched a self-driving taxi service, RoboTaxi, in Shanghai.</p>
<p>AutoX was also awarded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/autonomous-vehicle-startup-autox-lands-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/">a permit in California</a> to start driverless testing without a human safety driver, the third company after Waymo and Nuro to have landed such a permit.</p>
<p>The partnership was announced just weeks after Tel Aviv-based Arbe said it would go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Industrial Tech Acquisitions, at an equity valuation of $722 million. The move was supported by a $100 million PIPE )private investment in public equity) from investors that include M&amp;G Investment Management, Varana Capital, Texas Ventures and Eyal Waldman.</p>
<p>Markenko estimated during the webcast that Arbe’s revenue will only be $7 million in 2021, so investors are clearly bullish on the company’s technology. To that point, Markenko said he expects to exceed $300 million in revenue in 2025 — a 4,185% increase in just four years.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Many emerging and mature organizations survive or die based on their ability to scale. Scale quicker. Scale cheaper. Scale right.</p>
<p>Typically the IT team bears that burden — on top of countless other demands. IT teams move mountains for their organizations while scaling the tech platform as fast as possible, putting out the latest infrastructure fire and responding to countless day-to-day requests.</p>
<p>The most helpful gift any chief information officer or chief technology officer can give their IT teams is more time. Many people think that means adding another team member. Maybe it does in some cases (if you can find a developer in this tough job market), but giving my team <a href="https://boomi.com/">Boomi</a>’s low-code integration platform was one of the best strategic moves for HealthBridge.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The best time to use low-code is when you need to add something to your organization that isn’t unique or doesn’t drive significant business value.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As the least skilled coder on the team, low-code let me develop and deliver four customer-centric self-service portals a year ahead of schedule while my team focused on building and scaling our revenue-driving, custom platform by hand-writing code.</p>
<p>Low-code is quickly becoming commonplace and a popular topic among IT decision-makers. Over the last few years, the market has exploded. Gartner expects it <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-02-15-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-low-code-development-technologies-market-to-grow-23-percent-in-2021">to total $13.8 billion in 2021</a>. That means low-code technology, which we’ve been hearing about for years, is ready for widespread adoption. Today, low-code enables you to streamline (and scale) everything from integration to artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It’s a secret only some organizations are clued in on, but it’s a great way to scale fast, save on resources and give your team more time. Here’s how.</p>
<h2>When to use low-code and when to write code</h2>
<p>The best time to use low-code is when you need to add something to your organization that isn’t unique or doesn’t drive significant business value.</p>
<p>For instance, a customer portal is not unique; don’t waste time hand-coding it.</p>
<p>While it’s certainly an extremely helpful feature for our customers, it’s unlikely to drive significant shareholder or investor value. However, it’s key for scaling. Using low-code for a must-have but undifferentiated feature will allow your team to work on more important projects while scaling.</p>
<p>When we started working on the timeline for a customer portal project at HealthBridge, we estimated it would take several sprints per portal to develop, but more pressing development work kept pushing it down the list in our backlog. Waiting a year for a basic feature didn’t seem reasonable to me, so we looked for a workaround.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As online identity management grows in importance, <a href="http://mastercard.com">Mastercard</a> swooped in this morning and bought identity verification company <a href="http://ekata.com">Ekata</a> for $850 million.</p>
<p>Mastercard certainly sees the rapid digital transformation that is happening in online commerce, a move that was accelerated by COVID. It&#8217;s a transformation that once started isn&#8217;t likely to change back to the old ways of doing business, even when we get past the pandemic.</p>
<p>With Ekata, the company gets a solution that can verify the online identity of a person making the transaction in real time using various signals that can indicate if this is fraudulent or true as they open an account or transact business. The company provides a score and other data that predicts the likelihood this person is who they say they are. It&#8217;s not unlike a credit risk score, except for identity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;There have never been more $100M+ fintech rounds than right now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now/embed/#?secret=yYxPKcLBzm" data-secret="yYxPKcLBzm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That was one of the primary reasons Mastercard decided to acquire Ekata, according to Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence solutions at the company. &#8220;With the addition of Ekata, we will advance our identity capabilities and create a safer, seamless way for consumers to prove who they say they are in the new digital economy,&#8221; Bhalla said in a statement.</p>
<p>The two companies believe that by combining Mastercard&#8217;s fraud detection solutions with Ekata&#8217;s scoring approach, they will help prevent bad actors from using online platforms to conduct business. &#8220;The acceleration of online transactions has thrust global digital identity verification to the forefront as one of the biggest opportunities to build digital trust and combat global fraud,” Rob Eleveld, CEO at Ekata said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company, which was previously known as White Page Pro, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/06/12/1867525/0/en/Whitepages-Pro-Spins-Off-and-Becomes-Ekata.html#:~:text=Whitepages%20Pro%20will%20change%20its,reach%20%2420%20billion%20in%202022.">was spun out as Ekata</a> in June 2019. It has not raised any additional money, according to both Pitchbook and Crunchbase data. It would seem that $850 million represents a nice exit for a company that hasn&#8217;t raised a dollar, but it&#8217;s clearly more mature than your average startup with 2000 customers including Lyft, Stripe, Equifax, Checkout.com and Intuit.</p>
<p>It appears that Mastercard was willing to pay to get the company it wanted at a time when a solution like this is becoming more essential than ever. The acquisition is subject to standard regulatory approval, but remember regulators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">quashed the Visa-Plaid</a> deal last year. If it passes muster, it should close some time in the next six months, according to the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cannabis financing company Bespoke Financial today announced it raised $8 million in a Series A financing round. Through this round, the company brought new, key investors into its corner as it fights to bring financing solutions to companies in the cannabis space.</p>
<p>Bespoke is a direct lender and provides several financing solutions to companies operating in cannabis. These short-term loans allow the companies to build credit with Bespoke, which then offers better terms on subsequent loans and products. The company says its loan origination volume has grown exponentially, outgrowing forecasts by 25% over the proceeding year. The company has deployed $120 million in gross merchandise volume over 2,000 cannabis license holders with zero defaults to date.</p>
<p>With this new round of capital, Bespoke intends to launch new financing structures and expand its financing options across various distribution channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO and Co-founder George Mancheil calls this round a pivotal moment for his company and stamp of validation on the direction and products offered by Bespoke Financial. As he tells TechCrunch, this round provides several key partners to the growing startup.</p>
<p>The financing round was co-led by Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Casa Verde Capital and Sweat Equity Ventures, along with Ceres Group Holdings, Greenhouse Capital Partners, DoubleLine Capital&#8217;s co-founder and former president Philip Barach, and Robery Stavis, a VC based in New York.</p>
<p>This is Sweat Equity Ventures&#8217; (SEV) first investment into a cannabis company. SEV, backed and in part funded by LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, is led by Dan Portillo and works differently from traditional venture funds. SEV works with founders to provide top engineering and business talent to its portfolio companies. In exchange for these services, SEV takes equity from the companies instead of just writing checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our firm&#8217;s first investment in the cannabis industry, and we are excited to partner with Bespoke as more and more states legalize cannabis use, and the Federal government contemplates nationwide legalization. This partnership combines Bespoke&#8217;s finance and cannabis acumen with our team&#8217;s expertise scaling innovative tech companies, and will provide cannabis companies greater access to streamlined financing while benefiting investors with increased transparency and enhanced risk surveillance,&#8221; says Dan Portillo, Managing Partner of Sweat Equity Ventures, in a released statement.</p>
<p>Karan Wadhera, managing partner at Casa Verde Capital, says Bespoke Financial addresses real needs in a growing industry. Casa Verde Capital previously invested in Bespoke Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/meet-bespoke-financial-a-lender-for-cannabis-companies-backed-by-snoop-doggs-casa-verde-capital/">including in a $7 million round in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Bespoke CEO Mancheil tells TechCrunch his company is focused on being more than just a lender; it wants to be a modern financing company that allows it to act as a true partner with the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>With this $8 million in financing, Bespoke Financial has raised $28 million to date. The company was founded in 2019 and, as of this announcement, has 12 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re spent any time on TikTok lately, then you&#8217;ve probably seen a number of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl/video/6791976659705728262?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">Popl&#8217;s ads</a>. The <a href="https://popl.co/">startup</a> has been successfully leveraging social media to get its modern-day business card alternative in front a wider audience. Packaged as either a phone sticker, keychain or wristband, Popl uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">NFC</a> technology to make sharing contact information as easy as using Apple Pay. To date, Popl has sold somewhere over 700,000 units and has generated $2.7 million in sales for its digital business card technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://popl.co/">Popl</a> co-founder and CEO Jason Alvarez-Cohen, a UCLA grad with a background in computer science, first realized the potential for NFC business cards through a different use case &#8212; a device he encountered in someone&#8217;s home while attending a party. But it sparked the idea to use NFC technology for sharing information person-to-person, which would be faster than alternatives, like AirDrop or manual entry. And so, Popl was born.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139487" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139487" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?w=544" alt="" width="544" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=1229,1536 1229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=1638,2048 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Popl</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though startup history is littered with would-be &#8220;business card killers&#8221; that eventually died, what makes Popl different from early contenders is that it combines both an app with a physical product &#8212; the Popl accessory. This accessory can be purchased in a variety of form factors, including the popular Popl phone sticker that you can apply right to the back of your phone case (or even the top of your Popsocket), and customized with a photo of your choosing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that, in the past, people would tap phones and share information like that. But I learned quickly that you can&#8217;t do this just phone-to-phone with pure software,&#8221; says Alvarez-Cohen. &#8220;So I was like, what&#8217;s the closest way we can get the phone tapping? And that&#8217;s how I came up with this back-of-the-phone product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each Popl accessory is actually an NFC tag which enables the handoff of the user&#8217;s contact information. When the phones are close, the recipient will get a notification that alerts them to your shared Popl data.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other ways to quickly exchange contact information. You can easily enter in someone&#8217;s digits into your phone&#8217;s contacts app directly, for example, which may work better for more casual encounters &#8212; like meeting someone at a bar. But Popl lets you share a full business cards&#8217; worth of contact data with just a tap, which makes it better for professional encounters, or any other time you want to share more than just your phone number.</p>
<p>While the Popl tags make for a nice gimmick, the Popl mobile app is what makes the overall service useful. And to be clear, the app is <em>only</em> necessary for the Popl&#8217;s owner &#8212; the recipient doesn&#8217;t need the app installed for Popl to work. They will, however, need to have a phone that <a href="https://www.bluebite.com/nfc/iphone-nfc-compatibility">can read NFC tags</a>, which can leave out some older devices. Or, as a backup, they&#8217;ll need ability to scan the QR code the app provides as a workaround.</p>

<p>In the Popl app, you can customize which data you want to share with others &#8212; including your contact info, social profiles, website links, etc. &#8212; all via an easy-to-use interface. Like some business card apps in the past, you can flip in between a personal profile and a business profile in Popl in order to share the appropriate information when out networking. To actually make the exchange of contact information with another person, you simply hold up your phone to theirs and they&#8217;ll get a notification directing them to your Popl profile webpage. (The phones don&#8217;t have to physically touch or bump together, however. It&#8217;s more like Apple Pay, where they have to be near each other.)</p>
<p>From the Popl website that&#8217;s shared via the notification that pops up, the recipient can tap on the various options to connect with the sender &#8212; for example, adding them on a social network like LinkedIn or Instagram, grabbing their phone number to send a quick text, or even downloading a full contact card to their phone&#8217;s address book, among other things.</p>

<p>The app&#8217;s more clever feature, however, is something Popl calls &#8220;Direct.&#8221;</p>
<p>This patented feature won&#8217;t send over the Popl website where the recipient then has to choose how they want to connect. Instead, it opens up the destination app directly. For example, if you have LinkedIn Direct on, the recipient will be taken directly to your profile on LinkedIn when they tap the notification. Or if you put your Contact Card on Direct, it will just pop your address book entry onto the screen so the user can choose to save it to their phone.</p>
<p>For paid users, the app also lets you track your history of Popl connections on a map, so you can recall who you met, where and when, along with other analytics.</p>

<p>Work on Popl, which is co-founded by Alvarez-Cohen&#8217;s UCLA roommate, Nick Eischens, now Popl COO, began in late 2019. The startup then launched in February 2020 &#8212; just before the coronavirus lockdowns in the U.S. That could have been a disastrous time for a business designed to help people exchange information during in-person meetings when the world was now shifting to Zoom and remote work. But Alvarez-Cohen says they marketed Popl as a &#8220;contactless solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have this, and I have to meet someone for my business, I don&#8217;t even have to tap it &#8212;  you can just hover, and it will still send that information,&#8221; Alvarez-Cohen says. &#8220;So I&#8217;m able to share my business card with you without handing you a business card, which is kind of safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what really helped to sell Popl were its video demos. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl/video/6791976659705728262?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">One TikTok ad</a>, which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen if you use TikTok at all, features the co-founders&#8217; friend <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@endicci">Arev</a> sharing her TikTok profile with a new friend just as she&#8217;s leaving the gym.</p>
<p>In the video, the recipient &#8212; clearly dumbfounded by the technology after she taps his phone &#8212; responds <em>&#8220;what? what? Whoa! What? How&#8217;d you do that?!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s now been viewed over 80 million times.</p>

</blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl">Popl&#8217;s TikTok videos</a> get high tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and sometimes still millions of views per video. The company also has an active presence on other social media. For instance, Popl posts regularly to Instagram where it has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/popl/">over 100K followers</a>. Today, the startup&#8217;s growth now is about 60% driven by Facebook and Instagram marketing and 40% organic, Alvarez-Cohen says.</p>
<p>Now, the company is preparing new products for the post-pandemic era when in-person events return. Though it had before sold <a href="https://popl.co/pages/enterprise">Popl&#8217;s in bulk</a> for this purpose, it&#8217;s now readying an &#8220;event bracelet&#8221; that just slips on your wrist (and is reusable). The bracelet could be used at any big event &#8212; like music festivals or business conferences, where you&#8217;re meeting a lot of new people. And because Popl uses NFC, phones have to be close to make the contact info exchange &#8212; it won&#8217;t just randomly share your info with everyone you pass by them.</p>
<p>Popl is also fleshing out the business networking side of its app with integrations for Salesforce, Oracle and Hubspot, and CSV export, that come with its <a href="https://popl.co/pages/pro">Popl Pro subscription</a> ($4.99 per month). The in-app subscription is already at $320,000 in annual recurring revenue and growing 10% every week, as of early April.</p>
<p>A Y Combinator Winter 2021 participant, Popl is backed by Twitch co-founder Justin Kan (via Goat Capital), YC, Urban Innovation Fund, Cathexis Ventures, and others angels including Wish.com CEO Peter Szulczewski and Plangrid co-founder Ralph Gootee.</p>
<p>The app is available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/popl/id1503939262">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nfc.popl">Android</a>, and the Popl accessories are sold on its <a href="https://popl.co/">website</a> and on <a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=popl">Target.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has intervened to trigger public interest scrutiny of chipmaker&#8217;s Nvidia&#8217;s planned to buy Arm Holdings.</p>
<p>The secretary of state for digital issues, Oliver Dowden, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-secretary-instructs-cma-to-look-into-nvidias-takeover-of-arm">said today</a> that the government wants to ensure that any national security implications of the semiconductor deal are explored.</p>
<p>Nvidia&#8217;s $40BN acquisition of UK-based Arm was announced last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">September</a> but remains to be cleared by regulators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began to solicit views on the proposed deal in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/uks-markets-regulator-asks-for-views-on-nvidia-arm/">January</a>.</p>
<p>Domestic opposition to Nvidia&#8217;s plan has been swift, with one of the original Arm co-founders kicking off a campaign to &#8216;save Arm&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/arm-co-founder-starts-save-arm-campaign-to-keep-independence-amid-40b-nvidia-deal/">last year</a>. Hermann Hauser warned that Arm&#8217;s acquisition by a U.S. entity would end its position as a company independent of U.S. interests &#8212; risking the U.K.&#8217;s economic sovereignty by surrendering its most powerful trade weapon.</p>
<p>The intervention by Department of Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) &#8212; using statutory powers set out in the Enterprise Act 2002 &#8212; means the competition regulator has been instructed to begin a phase 1 investigation.</p>
<p>The CMA has a deadline of July 30 to submit its report to the secretary of state.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Dowden said: “Following careful consideration of the proposed takeover of ARM, I have today issued an intervention notice on national security grounds. As a next step and to help me gather the relevant information, the UK’s independent competition authority will now prepare a report on the implications of the transaction, which will help inform any further decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We want to support our thriving UK tech industry and welcome foreign investment but it is appropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>At the completion of the CMA&#8217;s phase 1 investigation Dowden will have an option to clear the deal, i.e. if no national security or competition concerns have been identified; or to clear it with remedies to address any identified concerns.</p>
<p>He could also refer the transaction for further scrutiny by instructing the CMA to carry out an in-depth phase 2 investigation.</p>
<p>After the phase 1 report has been submitted there is no set period when the secretary of state must make a decision on next steps &#8212; but DCMS notes that a decision should be made as soon as &#8220;reasonably practicable&#8221; to reduce uncertainty.</p>
<p>While Dowden&#8217;s intervention has been made on national security grounds, additional concerns have been raised about impact of an Nvidia take-over of Arm &#8212; specifically on U.K. jobs and on Arm&#8217;s open licensing model.</p>
<p>Nvidia sought to address those concerns last year, claiming it&#8217;s committed to Arm&#8217;s licensing model and pledging to expand the Cambridge, UK offices of Arm &#8212; saying it would create &#8220;a new global center of excellence in AI research&#8221; at the UK campus.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s hard to see what commercial concessions could be offered to assuage concern over the ramifications of an Nvidia-owed Arm on the UK&#8217;s economic sovereignty. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a political risk, which would require a political solution to allay, such as at a treaty level &#8212; something which isn&#8217;t in Nvidia&#8217;s gift (alone) to give.</p>
<p>National security concerns are a rising operational risk for tech companies involved in the supply of cutting edge infrastructure, such as semiconductor design and next-gen networks &#8212; where a relative paucity of competitors not only limits market choice but amps up the political calculations.</p>
<p>Proposed mergers are one key flash point as market consolidation takes on an acute politico-economic dimension.</p>
<p>However tech companies&#8217; operations are being more widely squeezed in the name of national security &#8212; such as, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/trump-huawei-zte-ban-tech/">in recent years</a>, the U.S. government&#8217;s attacks on China-based 5G infrastructure suppliers like Huawei, with former president Trump seeking to have the company barred from supplying next-gen networks not only within the U.S. but to national networks of Western allies.</p>
<p>Nor has (geo)political pressure been applied purely over key infrastructure companies in recent years; with Trump claiming a national security justification to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/trump-says-deadline-for-tiktok-sale-wont-be-extended/">try and shake down the Chinese-owned social networking company, TikTok</a> &#8212; in another example that speaks to how tech tools are being coopted into wider geopolitical power-plays, fuelled by countries&#8217; economic and political self-interest.</p>

<p>Hi there, new and returning readers. This is The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Just as I was getting ready to ship this newsletter, I spotted that there was a fatal crash involving a Tesla, in which no one was in the driver&#8217;s seat. There was an individual in the passenger seat and one in the rear. Both men died. <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Follow </span><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1n1174f r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/KPRC2Deven">@KPRC2Deven</a>, the Houston reporter who <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">broke this story over the weekend, to keep up with the latest.

<p>Welp. I was only partially right about the e-scooter pilot in New York City. On Wednesday, <strong>Lime</strong> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot/">as I predicted</a>), <strong>Bird</strong> and <strong>Veo</strong> were officially chosen to kick off the city&#8217;s first foray into the world of shared electric scooters. Equity, accessibility and proven capabilities of keeping those pesky vehicles off of sidewalks were top priorities for the NYC Department of Transportation. Each company will be releasing 1,000 e-scooters into parts of the east Bronx, with more to come in the second phase expanding further into the borough.</p>
<p>The process of gaining this small sliver of the Big Apple has been very competitive. City concessions are a hot commodity, and winning New York is perceived to be, in technical terms, a big deal. The operators that hit the mean streets of New York have the potential to survive as the rideshare industry continues to consolidate under two-wheeled micromobility giants. But there is something a little bit anticlimactic about the news. Not to knock the Bronx, but dockless e-scooters are needed and could be of use citywide. One has to wonder how much influence Lyft-owned Citi Bike has over where e-scooter companies get to operate.</p>
<p>The 2018 legislation that allowed for the e-scooter pilot in the first place very clearly stipulates that pilot zones would be prioritized based, in large part, on areas of the city that don&#8217;t have access to docked bike shares, which basically means areas that don&#8217;t have access to Citi Bike. And the pilot zone in the Bronx doesn&#8217;t extend into areas in the South Bronx where Citi Bike plans to expand. I guess we&#8217;ll see how it goes after the first year.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s talk about Europe</h2>
<p>Electric bikes and scooters are barely legal in Ireland, but <strong>Tier</strong> is already <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/dcu-rolls-out-e-scooter-scheme-on-its-campuses-1.4537439">preparing for more regulation</a>. The Berlin-based e-scooter company has partnered with the Irish micromobility tech platform Luna, the Insight SFO Centre for Data Analytics, and Smart DCU to create a new AI-powered e-scooter trial that&#8217;ll launch on Dublin City University campuses as soon as the ink on the bill legalizing e-scooters dries.</p>
<p>The fleet of 30 computer vision-enabled scooters will allow Insight researchers to analyze a new, ever-growing dataset. Luna&#8217;s tech will allow the scooters to roll out with pedestrian and lane identification, making them as safe as the Irish government could possibly hope for.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in France, the government is moving closer to being the first country in the world to offer people the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trading-clunkers-electric-bikes-france-moves-offer-financial-incentive-2021-04-11/">chance to trade in clunkers</a> for an electric or folding bicycle. Owners that scrap their yucky old ICE cars can get a €2,500 rebate to buy a bike with the money. The National Assembly just approved the measure in a preliminary vote.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Ok, I know we had Grab as deal of the week in the last edition of The Station, but now we have a finalized deal and it&#8217;s a lot bigger than expected.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Ride-hailing, delivery and super app&#8221; company Grab finally and officially <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/others/grab-go-public-in-partnership-with-altimeter/">announced</a> plans to go public. Grab, which operates in Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, merged with special purpose acquisition company Altimeter Growth Corp. The merger would value Grab at $39.6 billion and the company would keep $4.5 billion in cash. Importantly, Altimeter agreed to a three-year lockup period for its sponsor shares.</p>
<p>Grab has aspirations for the capital that the public markets provide. The company thinks there’s still a lot of room to grow when it comes to food delivery and on-demand mobility in Southeast Asia. It expects to see the total addressable market jump from $52 billion to $180 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>As part of the announcement, Grab shared some metrics and some big numbers. In 2020, the company managed to generate around $12.5 billion in gross merchandise value, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/grab-to-go-public-in-the-us-following-40-billion-spac-deal/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Romain Dillet reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Battery Resourcers</strong>, a startup that has a &#8220;closed loop&#8221; process to turn recycled battery material into nickel-manganese-cobalt cathodes to sell back to battery manufacturers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/battery-resourcers-raises-20m-to-commercialize-its-recycling-plus-manufacturing-operations/">raised</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in a $20 million Series B equity round led by Orbia Ventures, with injections from At One Ventures, TDK Ventures, TRUMPF Venture, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures and InMotion Ventures. Battery Resourcers CEO Mike O&#8217;Kronley declined to disclose the company&#8217;s new valuation.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, the autonomous vehicle company aiming to deploy robotaxis in San Francisco and Dubai, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/walmart-helps-push-cruises-latest-investment-round-to-2-75b/">added Walmart as an investor</a> in an extended fundraising round that has grown to $2.75 billion. The company said it has a post-money valuation of more than $30 billion. Walmart and several unnamed institutional investors added capital to a $2 billion equity round announced back in January that was led by Microsoft.</p>

<p><strong>Dat Bike</strong>, a Vietnamese startup with ambitions to become the top electric motorbike company in Southeast Asia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/vietnamese-electric-motorbike-startup-dat-bike-raises-2-6m-led-by-jungle-ventures/">raised $2.6 million in pre-Series A funding</a> led by Jungle Ventures. Dat Bike&#8217;s selling point is its ability to compete with gas motorbikes in terms of pricing and performance. Its new funding is the first time Jungle Ventures has invested in the mobility sector, and included participation from Wavemaker Partners, Hustle Fund and iSeed Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Oxbotica</strong>, a U.K. startup that develops autonomous driving systems took on online grocer Ocado as a new investor. Ocado, which took a $13.8 million stake in the AV startup, is treating this as a strategic investment to develop AI-powered, self-driving systems that will work across its operations, from vehicles within and around its packing warehouses through to the last-mile vehicles that deliver grocery orders to people&#8217;s homes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/oxbotica-raises-13-8m-from-ocado-to-build-autonomous-vehicle-tech-for-the-online-grocers-logistics-network/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong>, Volvo Car Group&#8217;s standalone electric performance brand, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/polestar-raises-500m-from-outside-investors-as-ev-market-grows/">raised $550 million</a> in its first external round led by Chongqing Chengxing Equity Investment Fund Partnership, Zibo Financial Holding and Zibo Hightech Industrial Investment. SK Inc., the South Korean global conglomerate, and a range of other investors also participated.</p>
<p><strong>TuSimple</strong> debuted on the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001823593/000119312521108212/d909743ds1a.htm">public market this week</a>. The company raised a bit more than $1 billion in its IPO, selling shares at $40. I interviewed the CEO Cheng Lu, so keep an eye out for that article in the next few days.</p>
<p><strong>Xwing</strong> scored another win two months after it completed its first gate-to-gate autonomous demonstration flight of a commercial cargo aircraft. The company announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/autonomous-aviation-startup-xwing-hits-400m-valuation-after-latest-funding-round/">raised $40 million</a> at a post-money valuation of $400 million.</p>
<h2>Scale AI&#8217;s Alexandr Wang</h2>

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Scale AI</strong>, the data labeling startup that essentially<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> sells the picks and shovels needed to develop and apply artificial intelligence, closed a $155 million round  back in December. Just after that round closed, more investors came calling co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang told me in a recent interview. </span></p>
<p>The upshot? A $325 million Series E funding round co-led by Dragoneer, Greenoaks Capital and Tiger Global at a valuation of more than $7 billion — double what it was four months ago. Additional new investors Wellington Management and Durable Capital joined existing investors Coatue, Index, Founders Fund and YC. Jeff Wilke, former CEO of Amazon&#8217;s Worldwide Consumer business, will be joining as advisor to Wang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors, I think are really ready to go all in on AI and you&#8217;re seeing that just across the board in terms of investments,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;A lot of that is because, I think AI as an industry is really going from something that&#8217;s been more research based and theoretical to one that&#8217;s really rooted in impact and real business results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang said the company, which got its start serving the autonomous vehicle industry, is seeing an increase in demand for its product from a broad swath of industries, including the government. Its customers now include fintech companies like Brex, PayPal and Square, e-commerce businesses Etsy, Instacart and Pinterest, transportation and logistics companies Flexport, GM, Luminar, Oshkosh as well government agencies such as the Department of Defense and U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p>Wang said they&#8217;ve also noticed this &#8220;incredible pickup&#8221; from its customers to view Scale AI as a full stack infrastructure provider and a full stack AI partner, rather than just a data lake provider. &#8220;That&#8217;s been another big evolution that is that a lot of our investors are really excited about.</p>
<p>And finally, I asked Wang if we should expect an IPO or another fundraising round soon. He didn&#8217;t quite answer my question. But here&#8217;s what he did say:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our goal is to build a super sustainable business where we don&#8217;t need to keep raising outside capital and so our intent is certainly not to not to have to keep raising money to operate the business, and in fact I think historically we&#8217;ve always operated really efficiently,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;I think the idea is that we as a business, we don&#8217;t really need to keep raising outside capital, beyond this.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Policy corner</h2>

<p>Hey there! TechCrunch reporter <strong>Aria Alamalhodaei</strong> loves some good wonky policy. And so periodically — like today! — she will bring us transportation-related policy updates.</p>
<p>EV manufacturers have been waging legislative battles in multiple states over the ability to sell directly to customers, rather than at established franchise dealerships. It&#8217;s a privilege that&#8217;s been held to this point only by Tesla, and even then only in select states. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/ev-rivals-tesla-rivian-unite-to-target-direct-sales-legislation/">TechCrunch covered the issue a few weeks ago</a>.) But there are signs that the fight may be turning into something larger.</p>
<p>A senior representative from one of the country&#8217;s largest automaker lobbying groups, Alliance for Automaker Innovation &#8212; which has until this point been fighting EV makers&#8217; push to direct sell, in step with dealership groups &#8212; made a major pivot from this stance. Alliance&#8217;s Wayne Weikel told Vermont lawmakers during a hearing of one of the state&#8217;s legislative committees that it is Alliance&#8217;s position in Vermont that the state should consider allowing automakers to sell directly to customers &#8212; all automakers.</p>
<p>This is a major break from the group&#8217;s established position, which is defending dealers&#8217; monopoly on selling cars in every other state where direct sales legislation is being considered. It&#8217;s unclear why the group has broken ranks in Vermont only, or if they&#8217;ll be doing so in any other state.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that things will be changing anytime soon, and certainly not in all fifty states. The direct sales bills in Washington and Georgia were both killed this legislative session, for example. A source close to the issue noted to TechCrunch that Washington&#8217;s Rep. Amy Walen (D), the Vice Chair of the House Consumer Protection and Business Committee (which heard the bill), is herself an auto dealer &#8212; the owner of Hyundai of Kirkland. The same is true of a legislator in Idaho, Rep. Jim Addis, who is part of a committee hearing the direct sales bill in that state.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>— Aria Alamalhodaei</em></p>
<p><strong>Oh and one more thing, from TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Remember the bill that California state Senator Dave Min introduced<span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month that would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/california-bill-would-require-all-self-driving-vehicles-to-be-zero-emission-by-2025/">require all AVs in the state</a> to be zero-emission by 2025? Well, the bill has cleared the California Senate Transportation Committee. The language has been reworked a bit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the bill would require all light-duty autonomous vehicles to be zero emission by 2027. The previous language hadn’t stipulated a type of self-driving vehicle, which could have had massive consequences on industries planning on heavy-duty AVs like autonomous trucking. While the bill still has a ways to go before it’s on Governor Newsom’s desk, it’s in line with the state’s goals to reduce emissions.</span></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Argo AI</strong> will be releasing its Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment — the official jargon in government speak for what can be described as its safety report — on Monday. But here at The Station, you <a href="https://www.argo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArgoSafetyReport.pdf">can see it first</a>. I haven&#8217;t done a super close read yet, but check out page 30 for the description on perception and a few pages later, how their self-driving system handles ambiguous situations.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Cruise</strong> announced it struck a deal to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/cruise-strikes-deal-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-dubai/">launch a robotaxi service in Dubai</a> in 2023. This announcement felt like a distraction and has me wondering when Cruise is going to make — and show — technical progress with its autonomous vehicle deployment efforts in San Francisco, the market it has been aiming for all these years. Cruise said the robotaxi service in Dubai will use the Cruise Origin, the all-electric shuttle-like vehicle that has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to travel at highway speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Intel</strong> subsidiary <strong>Mobileye</strong> struck a deal with Udelv to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ntels-mobileye-teams-with-udelv-to-launch-35000-driverless-delivery-vehicles-by-2028/">supply its self-driving system</a> to thousands of purpose-built autonomous delivery vehicles. The companies said they plan to put more than 35,000 autonomous vehicles, dubbed Transporters, on city streets by 2028. Commercial operations are slated to begin in 2023. It&#8217;s worth noting that Udelv was once developing its own self-driving system, but has now ditched that in favor of Mobileye&#8217;s SDS.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nuro</strong>, the autonomous delivery vehicle company, will soon be delivering Domino’s pizza in parts of Houston. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/dominos-nuro-to-begin-autonomous-pizza-deliveries-in-houston/">Please welcome your new pizza overlords</a>.) On certain days and times, customers who prepay online can choose to have the bot R2 drop their pizzas off. They’ll receive a text when the robot is outside and will be given an access code to open the bot’s chamber and release hot cheesy goodness into their hands.</span></p>
<p><strong>WeRide</strong>, the Chinese autonomous vehicle startup that recently raised $310 million, received a permit to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-weride-scores-permit-to-test-driverless-cars-in-san-jose/">test driverless vehicles</a> (meaning without a human safety driver behind the wheel) on public roads in San Jose, California. WeRide is the seventh company, following AutoX, Baidu, Cruise, Nuro Waymo and Zoox, to receive a driverless testing permit. The permit only allows for two driverless vehicles.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>GM</strong> and LG Chem announced plans to build a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/gms-second-2-3b-battery-plant-with-lg-chem-to-open-in-late-2023/">second U.S. battery cell factory</a> &#8212; a $2.3 billion facility in Spring Hill, Tennessee that will supply the automaker with the cells needed for the 30 electric vehicle models it plans to launch by mid decade.</p>
<p><strong>QuantumScape</strong>, the solid state battery company, filed a <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-119470/">document with the SEC</a> that caught my attention. Celina Mikolajczak has joined its board. Why does that matter? Mikolajczak is the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Vice President of Engineering and Battery Technology at Panasonic Energy of North America and prior to that was senior manager, cell quality and materials engineering at Tesla.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong>, the Amazon-backed EV manufacturer aiming to bring an electric pickup to market later this year, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ev-automaker-rivian-partners-with-samsung-sdi-in-battery-cell-supply-deal/">partnered with Samsung SDI</a> as its battery cell supplier. The two companies did not disclose the value of the deal or its term length, but in a statement Rivian said it had been working with Samsung SDI &#8220;throughout the vehicle development process.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tesla&#8217;s</strong> lawsuit against Dr. Guangzhi Cao is over. For the unfamiliar, Tesla had accused Cao, a former employee, of stealing source code from its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system and sharing it with XMotors, the U.S. unit of Chinese EV maker Xpeng, where he had taken a new job. A U.S. district court filing dated April 15 said the matter had been settled. Cao no longer works at XMotors.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the statement from XMotors, which was never made a party to the lawsuit.</p>
<blockquote><p>After over two years of extensive discovery, including against XMotors, Tesla has failed to find any substantive evidence that supports its allegations and innuendos against XMotors. Tesla has failed to show any credible evidence that XMotors ever possessed, let alone used, any Tesla information from Dr. Cao.</p>
<p>Tesla has finally dismissed its claims and stopped its search for evidence that does not exist.</p>
<p>Technology innovation is at core of our foundation and strategy. In our pursuit of popularizing smart EVs, we respect any competition; however, we will not tolerate any bullying behavior or attempt to disrupt competitors. XMotors fully respects intellectual property rights, and bases its own competitive edge on its in-house-developed proprietary R&amp;D and intellectual property.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>TezLab</strong>, a free app that’s like a Fitbit for a Tesla vehicle, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/tesla-owners-can-now-see-how-much-solar-or-coal-is-powering-their-evs/">pushed out a new feature</a> this week that shows the energy mix — breaking down the exact types and percentages of fossil fuels and renewable energy — coming from charging locations, including Superchargers and third-party networks throughout the United States.</p>
<h3>Evtols</h3>
<p><strong>NFT Inc.</strong>, a relatively unknown drive-and-fly vehicle startup, is betting it will succeed where its rivals have failed, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/nft-inc-reimagines-urban-and-rural-living-with-flying-car-aska/">preorders opening for ASKA</a>, its first electric flying car. The SUV-sized ASKA ( which means &#8220;flying bird&#8221; in Japanese) may be better described as a plane that drives, rather than a car that flies. Even when its six rotors are folded closed, the vehicle has the unmistakable look of a flying craft, with a helicopter-esque bubble front window and a distinct tail that would be familiar to anyone who has flown on an airplane. Important note: ASKA isn&#8217;t anticipated to be delivered until 2026.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p><strong>Apex.AI</strong>, a startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic, has spent four years rewriting the robot operating system that will give automakers the tools to integrate software within the vehicle and make sure all the applications run reliably. Now, freshly armed with a safety certification that validates its software development kit (SDK) is sophisticated enough to be used in production vehicles, Apex.AI has landed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/toyota-taps-apex-ai-for-its-autonomous-vehicle-operating-system/">Toyota and Japanese tech startup Tier IV as partners</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</strong> executives warned that the global semiconductor shortage, which has produced production slowdowns at Ford and General Motors, may drag on into 2022. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei pointed to the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as &#8220;geopolitical tensions&#8221; as reasons for the prolonged shortage in an investor call. TSMC, one of the world&#8217;s largest chip manufacturers, supplies chips for a wide range of products including smartphones, high-performing computers, and Internet of Things. Automotive sales accounted for 4% of their first-quarter revenue, which may not seem like much &#8212; but that&#8217;s a 31% increase quarter-over-quarter. (Aria Alamaldohaei)</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> will debut its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/ford-takes-aim-at-tesla-gm-with-its-new-hands-free-driving-system/">new hands-free driving feature</a> (nope this doesn&#8217;t belong in the AV section) on the 2021 F-150 pickup truck and certain 2021 Mustang Mach-E models through a software update later this year. The automaker is aiming to compete with similar systems from Tesla and GM.</p>
<p>That hands-free capability uses cameras, radar sensors and software to provide a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane centering and speed-sign recognition. The system also has an in-cabin camera that monitors eye gaze and head position to help ensure the driver&#8217;s eyes remain on the road.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> lifted the final veil on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/all-the-tech-crammed-into-the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs/">flagship EQS sedan</a> after weeks of teasers, announcements and even a pre-production drive in which TechCrunch participated. (The company also released a 62-page press release alongside the reveal). There is a ton of the tech crammed into this vehicle from the microsleep warning system and 56-inch hyperscreen to the monster HEPA air filter and the software that intuitively learns the driver&#8217;s wants and needs. Oh, and 350 sensors used to record distances, speeds and accelerations, lighting conditions, precipitation and temperatures, the occupancy of seats as well as the driver&#8217;s blink of an eye or the passengers&#8217; speech.</p>
<h3>Ride-hailing</h3>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> appears to have lost another legal battle in Europe. Labor activists challenging Uber over what they allege are &#8216;robo-firings&#8217; of drivers in Europe have trumpeted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/uber-hit-with-default-robo-firing-ruling-after-another-eu-labor-rights-gdpr-challenge/">winning a default judgement</a> in the Netherlands &#8212; where the Court of Amsterdam ordered the ride-hailing giant to reinstate six drivers who the litigants claim were unfairly terminated &#8220;by algorithmic means.&#8221; The court also ordered Uber to pay the fired drivers compensation.</p>
<p>In other Uber-related news &#8230; Uber&#8217;s transit SaaS program is expanding in partnership with three new agencies in Denver, Cecil County, Maryland and Porterville, California. Uber Transit already has deals with Marin Transit in California and Cape May County in New Jersey.</p>
<h2>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</h2>
<p>The TC Sessions: Mobility 2021 event, which is scheduled for June 9,  will be virtual again — as I mentioned last week. I&#8217;ll provide updates each week as we announce speakers.</p>
<p>This week, I want to point your attention to a panel I put together that will focus on mobility, profitability and equity. Here are the questions we hope to address: can mobility be accessible, equitable and profitable? And how?</p>
<p>We are bringing together three guests who are at the center of cities, equity and shared mobility to help us answer those questions — community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong>, Remix co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong> and Revel co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true">Early Bird tickets</a> to the show are now available — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book today</a> and save $100 before prices go up.</em></strong></p>
<p>Other guests to TC Sessions: Mobility 2021, includes <strong>Joby Aviation</strong> founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and LinkedIn founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong>, whose SPAC merged with Joby, investors <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of <strong>Urban Innovation Fund</strong>, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of <strong>Autotech Ventures</strong> and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> of <strong>Construct Capital</strong>, as well as <strong>Starship Technologies</strong> co-founder and CEO/CTO <strong>Ahti Heinla</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/61f51db4-eafc-45e9-a2f1-6016dcb358e0?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/do-you-need-a-spac-therapist/">news roundup from last week</a> was probably the most fun I&#8217;ve had in a few months, so make sure to catch up on that if you haven&#8217;t. That said, here&#8217;s a rundown of what we got into on the show this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">new Clubhouse round</a> has us thinking about what is a good venture-style bet, and what isn&#8217;t. At least you can&#8217;t fault the Clubhouse crew for not having conviction.</li>
<li>UiPath <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521120347/d98556ds1a.htm">raised its IPO range</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">as expected</a>.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s an Apple event this week, which caused us to wonder why more startups aren&#8217;t competing with the giant.</li>
<li>Cryptos have recovered from the flash crash, which had us thinking.</li>
<li>Druva raised $147 million as TechCrunch will report later today, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/razorpay-160-million-raise-valuation-hits-3-billion/">Razorpay raised even more capital</a> at a newly refreshed valuation.</li>
<li>Finally, DoNotPay had some news, but it&#8217;s corporate ethos proved even more interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The week is here, everyone! It&#8217;s Monday! We can do this!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/transfer-your-facebook-posts-and-notes-with-our-expanded-data-portability-tool/">announced</a> a new feature that will allow users to export their Facebook posts and notes to a number of third-party services. Although the company has long since offered tools that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/facebook-now-allows-you-to-download-your-information/">let you download the information</a> you&#8217;ve posted to Facebook, the tool launching today offers a more practical way of saving that data &#8212; by allowing you to export your notes and posts to popular services like Google Docs, Blogger, or WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Facebook users will find this latest feature under the &#8220;Your Facebook Information&#8221; menu in Settings, where you&#8217;ll then click &#8220;Transfer Your Information.&#8221; A series of prompts will walk you through the process to transfer you data to the one of the available destinations.</p>
<p>To protect the data, Facebook says it will ask users to re-enter their password before the transfer begins, which it also does with other exports. The process will encrypt the data as it moves between Facebook and the other service, the company notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move to support the export of text-based content is interesting, as <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-paying-writers-journalists-pages-0b96d3cd-e61b-4435-9f54-99aed136f932.html">it&#8217;s been reported</a> Facebook is developing a competitor to newsletter platform Substack. The social network aims to capitalize on the growing momentum in the newsletter industry, which has recently seen a number of top writers leave larger publications in order to connect with their audience directly, via paid newsletters. Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">also acquired a newsletter business, Revue</a>, to pursue the same goals. While Facebook didn&#8217;t say if it&#8217;s upcoming product would be included in the export procedure announced today, it makes for a good hedge against any sort of anti-competitive claims if and when Facebook rolls out the new service.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s addition is part of Facebook&#8217;s larger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/20/data-transfer-project/">Data Transfer Project</a>, a collaboration between tech giants designed to give users more ways to move their content between services. Last year, for example, Facebook added a feature that gave users a way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/facebook-now-allows-users-in-the-u-s-canada-to-export-photos-and-videos-to-google-photos/">export their Facebook photos and videos to Google Photos</a>, as a result of the team-up. Users can now also export photos and videos to Backblaze, Dropbox, and Koofr, as well.</p>
<p>Alongside news of its announcement, Facebook argued for regulation in the area of data portability. It said there should be laws that determine which data should be made portable, and who is responsible for protecting the data once it has been transferred. The company also pointed to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/comments-on-data-portability/">comments it filed with the FTC</a> last year as well as <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/privacy-and-data-portability/">a white paper</a> that explored the privacy questions that surround the development of data portability tools.</p>

<p>TechCrunch just hosted a small virtual meetup with Detroit startups and venture capitals. Like the one we held last month in Miami, the event was a blast and featured a talk with two local VCs on what startups work in Detroit and how to raise money from local investors.<br />

In case you missed it, the video of this talk is below. Jonathon Triest from <a href="https://www.ludlowventures.com">Ludlow Ventures</a> and Patti Glaza from <a href="https://investdetroit.vc">Invest Detroit Ventures</a> spoke extensively on the wide-ranging types of startups that call Detroit home. They point to Bloomscape (houseplants) to StockX (sneakers) to the numerous medical and security startups in Detroit, nearby Ann Arbor, and the surrounding metro area. Both firms invest in early stage startups, but do so in radically different ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Atlassian today announced that it has acquired Brisbane, Australia-based <a href="https://www.thinktilt.com/">ThinkTilt</a>, the company behind the popular Jira-centric no-code/low-code form builder <a href="https://www.thinktilt.com/proforma/forms-for-jira-service-management">ProForma</a>. The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition.</p>
<p>The acquisition is meant to help strengthen <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management">Jira Service Management</a>, Atlassian&#8217;s version of Jira that focuses on IT service management (ITSM). Launched in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/introducing-jira-service-management">November 2020</a>, Jira Service Management is meant to remove the barriers between development and IT operations and provide them with a unified platform, but it also enables other teams (think HR, legal or finance) to set up their own service operations.</p>
<p>Edwin Wong, Atlassian&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">head of product, IT, tells me that the company already has over 30,000 customers who use Jira Service Management (though to be fair, Jira Service Management is in part a rebrand of Jira Service Desk with additional ITSM functionality, so a lot of these users were previous Jira Service Desk customers).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One thing that I keep hearing from our customers when we speak to them, is that what makes us different is that Jira Service Management really helps them deliver value quickly, without the cost and complexity of some of the other ITSM solutions that they&#8217;ve used in the past. It&#8217;s just easier to set up, get going and maintain,&#8221; Wong said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140145" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/atlassian_thinktilt.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140145" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2140145" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/atlassian_thinktilt.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140145" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while at launch, the company&#8217;s focus was very much on bringing developers and IT together, Wong stressed that today&#8217;s announcement is very much about how IT can help other business teams develop services as well &#8212; and cope with the reality of remote and hybrid work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Employees now expect digital experiences from the employers and their colleagues as much as they expect them in every aspect of their consumer lives, as these two things blend together,&#8221; Wong noted. &#8220;Fact is, you can&#8217;t really walk up to the HR team anymore when you&#8217;re working remote and say, &#8216;hey, I&#8217;ve got someone coming in.&#8217; You can&#8217;t go tap on their shoulder and say, &#8216;hey, upgrade that campaign for me.&#8217; That&#8217;s not really going to work anymore.&#8221; </span>But ThinkTilt, Wong argues, helps businesses &#8220;create amazing customer and employee experiences, and allows anyone to do that really quickly and easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, ProForma comes with all the tools you would need to create forms (and there are <a href="https://docs.thinktilt.com/proforma/proforma-features.1646821396.html#">a lot of them</a>) and it is already deeply integrated with Jira and Jira Service Management. It also features over 300 templates for often used business flows like candidate approval tracking in an HR system, for example. &#8220;What we&#8217;re really providing for our customers is not just the features and saying, &#8216;hey, figure it out yourselves,&#8217; but really that practice and the [ThinkTilt] team really brings with them an amazing amount of knowledge with that,&#8221; Wong said about ProForma&#8217;s set of templates.</p>
<p>One neat tool more companies should offer: ProForma features a fully functional <a href="https://proformademo.thinktilt.net/">demo mode</a> that lets you try out the product before even signing up for its free trial.</p>
<p>Jira Service Management, of course, can already build all these workflows, too. That is, after all, what the product is all about. But with ProForma, an HR team could capture all the information they need to capture for a given workflow, with Jira Service Management becoming the backend for those operations. Or they can easily create forms based on existing workflows, too, and enhance the user experience that way.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last five years, Atlassian regularly acquired a company or two per year. Currently, though, it feels like this pace is picking up a bit. Indeed, the acquisition of ThinkTilt marks the company&#8217;s fourth acquisition in the last twelve months. In February, it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/atlassian-is-acquiring-chartio-to-bring-data-visualization-to-the-platform/">visualization and analytics company Chartio</a>, while in 2020, it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/atlassian-acquires-halp-to-bring-slack-integration-to-the-forefront/">helpdesk tool Halp</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/atlassian-acquires-asset-management-company-mindville/">asset management company Mindville</a>. If anything, I would expect this pace to increase in the next year as Atlassian aims to capitalize on current trends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://zoom.com">Zoom</a> launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/">Zoom Apps and the Marketplace</a> as a place to sell them last year, it was a big signal that the company wanted to be more than just a popular video conferencing application. It wanted to be a platform, which developers could use to build applications on top of Zoom.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $100 million investment fund to encourage the most promising startups using the Zoom toolset to launch a business by giving them funding, while using that as a springboard to encourage other developers to take advantage of the tooling on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re looking for companies with a viable product and early market traction, and a commitment to developing on and investing in the Zoom ecosystem,&#8221; Zoom&#8217;s Colin Born wrote <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-apps-fund/">in a blog post</a> announcing the new program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s corporate development team with heavy involvement from the Zoom executive team will be in charge of selecting and managing the portfolio companies. The company plans to invest between $250,000 and $2.5 million in each startup in the portfolio.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big part of this is helping facilitate those early companies and giving them the access to resources and connections within Zoom, so that they can grow and succeed,&#8221; Zoom CTO Brendan Ittelson told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WiRZl5OW1y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/">Zoom introduces new SDK to help developers tap into video services</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zoom introduces new SDK to help developers tap into video services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/embed/#?secret=WiRZl5OW1y" data-secret="WiRZl5OW1y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the company wants to invest successfully, a big part of this is using the fund to encourage developers to take advantage of the platform offerings from Zoom. &#8220;We feel we&#8217;ll help [these startups] build these valuable and engaging experiences and by having that and by investing, we&#8217;re helping bring solutions and further expand the ecosystem and our customers should benefit from that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zoom has a number of developer tools that budding entrepreneurs can use to build applications that take advantage of Zoom functionality. In March <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/">the company introduced an SDK</a> (software development kit) designed to help programmers embed Zoom functionality inside other applications.</p>
<p>The company also provides tools for embedding an application inside of Zoom, such as one designed for a specific purpose like education or healthcare, and it has created a centralized place to learn about all of them at <a href="http://developer.zoom.us">developer.zoom.us</a>.</p>
<p>Zoom is not alone in investing in companies building applications on its platform. Firms like Sequoia, Maven Ventures and Emergence Capital have already started investing in startups building companies on top of Zoom including <a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/">Mmhmm</a>, <a href="https://www.dockethq.com/calendar-app/">Docket</a> and <a href="https://www.classedu.com/">ClassEdu</a>.</p>
<p>The fund gives startup founders one more option to get some funding to get their idea off the ground. Ittelson says all of the investments will be seed level investments for starters and they will be providing developer and business resources to help the young startups build and distribute their products.</p>
<p>While he says that the company will be on the lookout for promising startups to bring into the portfolio, interested entrepreneurs can apply directly at <a href="https://zoom.us/fund">zoom.com/fund</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lawyer and veteran of the startup world (but <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewyang/status/1105859481219616770?lang=en">don&#8217;t call him a VC</a>), Andrew Yang rose to national prominence during his 2020 campaign for president. A hard-fought battle in a crowded field, Yang made a name for himself as an outsider candidate, heavily favoring a technocratic approach to policy that reflected his entrepreneurial background.</p>
<p>His approach earned a sizable following through a self-stylized Yang Gang of supporters. In particular, his “Freedom Dividend” proposal helped reintroduce concepts of universal basic income (UBI) back into mainstream American discourse.</p>
<p>Yang dropped out of the race in February 2020, after failing to crack 3% in the New Hampshire primary. At the time, he told supporters, “we&#8217;re just getting started.” In January of this year, he announced his candidacy for mayor of New York in a bid to succeed fellow 2020 presidential candidate Bill de Blasio. Once again, Yang has entered a crowded field. This time, however, he does so with national name recognition that has helped propel him to the top of polls.</p>
<p>Like the presidential election before it, the New York City mayoral race comes at an unprecedented time. More than a year after becoming the epicenter of the pandemic, the city is still reeling from the impact of COVID-19. It has made for a unique campaign, with candidates relying on social media more than ever &#8212; to sometimes mixed results.</p>
<p>As the United States’ largest city looks to reopen, the next mayor will face unique challenges &#8212; and, perhaps, opportunities. We spoke with Yang over Zoom to discuss his hopes for the city and the role technology might play in getting there.</p>

<p><strong>You are <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewyang/status/1374689935547101186?lang=en">on record</a> as being supportive of the Amazon Union. They were dealt a big blow recently with the vote. In 2021, what do you think is the best course of action for blue-collar and gig workers going forward?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s been keeping up with me knows I am deeply concerned about the impact of technology on blue-collar workers, in particular. If you look at anything from trucking to retail, to even things like butchering and meatpacking, we&#8217;re automating them away, much more quickly.</p>
<p>There are some instances where unions can help, but if you look at the macro-environment, the proportion of American workers who are unionized has gone down by about half. And so, we should do much more for workers who right now don&#8217;t have benefits in terms of portable benefits programs.</p>
<p>I think versions of freelancing and the gig economy are here to stay. And a lot of those workers don&#8217;t have meaningful benefits in terms of healthcare or retirement or other provisions. We essentially are running an industrial-era economy that has transformed, but our institutions haven&#8217;t caught up, and we need to try and get them to catch up as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><strong>We&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of union movement in tech. Kickstarter is a good example. Do you think unions should play a role in both blue and white-collar tech jobs?</strong></p>
<p>I was for the union drive in the Amazon warehouse, because I think it would have created really positive pressure on Amazon to treat workers better in many different environments. I&#8217;m for really rethinking a lot of the things we&#8217;re doing right now, where if you look at top-line, Keynes predicted that by now we&#8217;d be so wealthy that we&#8217;d be working only 15 hours a week. And he was right about the top-line growth. We are as wealthy as he predicted, but our work weeks are getting longer, not shorter. And that&#8217;s having adverse consequences for people of every background, white collar, blue collar.</p>
<p>I think we should be exploring bigger modifications, like a four-day work week, which studies have shown that we can get the same amount done in four days in many, many environments. And then our mental health would improve. Our outlooks would improve. So I think we should be thinking bigger. And right now unions have been a path of the middle class for many, many Americans, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be unions alone that can solve some of these problems, particularly in many environments where unions aren&#8217;t terribly prevalent.</p>

<p><strong>You <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/03/29/andrew-yang-new-york-city-mayoral-race/">recently said</a> that letting Amazon and its 26,000 jobs walk away from New York City was not a good thing in reference to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/amazon-drops-plans-for-new-york-hq2/">HQ2</a>. But you, along with other Democratic politicians, have criticized the fact that they don&#8217;t pay federal taxes. If a company like Amazon were to relocate or bring a substantial number of jobs in New York City, how would you hold them accountable?</strong></p>
<p>I guess there&#8217;s a difference between the local impact and the federal impact. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good thing that a trillion-dollar company doesn&#8217;t pay any federal taxes, but if you are a locality and someone comes along and it&#8217;s going to be good for your community, then you say, &#8220;yes.&#8221; I want to make the case that New York City loves business. It loves businesses big and small that are based here. And it wants more companies to know that New York City is the best place to build a world-class company and culture. So, that would be my stance as mayor, if a large tech company wanted to come to New York, and if there&#8217;s a large tech company that&#8217;s reading this right now or a small one or an entrepreneur, come to New York! Early next year, if I&#8217;m mayor, I&#8217;m going to be doing everything I can to help you.</p>

<p><strong>A lot of the pushback that they were getting were around incentives. Is there a way to bring a company like Amazon into New York without offering that?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good when localities end up bidding against each other to try and bring in various companies. One of my proposals when I was running for national office was that we should actually make it impossible to do so by making any benefits that are provided to a company in that manner themselves taxable, at a rate of a 100%.</p>
<p>So, the entire thing becomes a non-starter and companies then would be based where they think it&#8217;s most advantageous to their organization to be based, not by pitting cities against each other as to who&#8217;s going to bend over backwards the most. I think that would be a better system and people were upset about the level of subsidies that were supposed to be directed to Amazon with HQ2, and that was legitimate concern.</p>
<p>And some of the local impacts were also of legitimate concern. But again, big picture, you cannot let an employer that&#8217;s going to create 26,000 high-paying jobs and probably an additional 100,000 or so service jobs walk away. You have to say New York City is the place for you.</p>
<p><strong>Among U.S. politicians, you’re probably the most closely associated with the concept of UBI. Is that something you see being implemented on a city level?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;ve been dozens of cities at this point that have either already rolled out some kind of basic income trial or are exploring doing so. And I&#8217;ve committed to making New York City the home for perhaps the biggest basic income trial outside of our federal government, sending everyone stimulus checks (which by the way I loved). And I think that cash relief and other measures are the future. So of course, I&#8217;m going to make New York City the site for one of the biggest basic income programs and in the country. And I think people are increasingly recognizing that it&#8217;s the best way to give many people a chance to be healthier, mentally healthier, more stable, more enterprising, more creative, more nurturing.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the pushback against UBI is around the loss of a social safety net. Do you think that there&#8217;s a way to implement it in New York City without getting rid of some of these existing benefits?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. The program we&#8217;re looking to roll out in New York targets the extreme poor, and would have no interaction with existing social safety nets. And I think that, again, cities around the country have made this work. And in no case that I&#8217;m aware of, has it actually interfered with someone&#8217;s ability to aid get from an existing program.</p>
<p><strong>Can and should government effectively regulate against the implementation of robotics and automation when it comes to job loss?</strong></p>
<p>I think economy-wide, that would be a completely ineffective strategy. It&#8217;d be almost impossible to implement. There might be an isolated case where you could do something that would make sense, but even then, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the best way to go. I think the better approach is to try and speed up the evolution of our economy so that it works for more and more people, even as technology is advancing. And I do believe cash relief and universal basic income are the first big step. And we all know the pandemic has accelerated many of these trends. Anyone that reads TechCrunch knows that automation technologies have been elevated in terms of corporate priorities.</p>
<p><strong>You tweeted that you <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1359992211186843649">would invest in making the city a hub for BTC</a> and other cryptocurrencies. You&#8217;ve also been pretty vocal about climate change. Is that a hard square to circle?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the cryptocurrencies that are out there, frankly, have already been mined. And so it&#8217;s not like you necessarily are looking at consuming tons of energy, if you say that the world&#8217;s financial capital in New York City is going to be very friendly to cryptocurrencies. And we&#8217;re talking about a trillion-dollar asset class at this point. If you are the financial capital, you have to make sure that your city is among the leaders in developing applications. I&#8217;ve been in touch with various people from the cryptocurrency community about ways that we can make New York City a proving ground for some of the applications that people have been working on.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond cryptocurrency, what role do you see technology playing in bringing people and businesses back to the city, following the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>I was talking to my friend, Eliot Horowitz, who is one of the co-founders of MongoDB, and he&#8217;s starting a new company around robotics. He says that when he&#8217;s trying to recruit people for his new company and says, &#8220;we&#8217;re headquartered in New York City and you would be based here&#8221; they are excited about it. A lot of people want to live in New York City.</p>
<p>New York City has the potential to be number one in technology, in part because I think the next generation of technologies will very much interact hand in hand with other industries, like the way that Peloton is a tech company, but it&#8217;s also a fitness and a exercise equipment company. You can see that New York City remains the hub for finance, but also for culture and branding and tourism and fashion and art and other industries.</p>
<p>This is going to be an incredible time for New York City to take advantage of its stature and the breadth of diversity of our economy to be competitive for any tech company.</p>
<p><strong>For a lot of companies working from home is becoming the standard. When so many tech companies in particular are opening up to remote work, how do you keep people excited about coming to a place like New York when they could potentially work from anywhere?</strong></p>
<p>I think right now a lot of people are still adapting. If, let&#8217;s say, you&#8217;ve worked remotely for a year (and that can mean a lot of different things), but a lot of people want to be able to go outside and experience the food, the culture, the nightlife, the companionship of a place like New York. And one thing that I know that tech companies prize is the ability to innovate and create. And studies have shown very consistently that workers are more creative and innovative when they&#8217;re together in the same office. That&#8217;s even true for academics producing research, that academics in the same physical proximity produce higher-level research.</p>
<p>And technology is the kind of industry where if you have even a tiny, competitive edge, it can be worth an incredible amount. And so if you imagine that Zoom is essentially like an equalizer, like a place like New York City will be a competitive edge and Eliot Horowitz is already experiencing that. I think that there are a lot of other companies that already know that. I talk to CEOs who are champing at the bit to get people back into the office for this reason.</p>
<p><strong>Does that mean some form of incentivizing businesses to bring people physically together into offices?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t rule anything out where New York City is concerned, because that is going to be central to our case. New York City is a premium environment, and there are ways that we can help establish that premium by helping people understand just what we can do for companies that are trying to grow and compete.</p>
<p><strong>What are your top cybersecurity priorities for New York?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s tough because, the fact is a lot of these systems are vulnerable right now. A lot of public agencies haven&#8217;t really properly invested in cybersecurity. So my priority would be to identify, frankly, the elements of New York&#8217;s infrastructure, that if they were hacked, it would be especially crippling and devastating, and invest in countermeasures trying to protect those assets as quickly as possible. Frankly, recognizing that it&#8217;s impossible to be a hundred percent secure in a lot of these arenas, but we can control our risks better than what we&#8217;re doing right now, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><strong>You got <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2021/04/12/yang-tweets-about-street-vendors-and-ignites-fury-on-the-left-1373504">pushback</a> against the food cart comments on Twitter earlier this week. Do you have any regrets about the ways in which you&#8217;ve used social media during the campaign?</strong></p>
<p>If you look at my social media, the vast, vast majority of it is promoting being out and about New York City, whether it&#8217;s a restaurant that my wife and I are having dinner at, or attending a Yankee&#8217;s game at Yankee Stadium (though I am a Mets fan). when I walked the streets of New York City, people are really excited to see me most all the time. And then I&#8217;ll often take a picture with them, and I posted one today that I think made that person very happy.</p>
<p>So I think that my use of social media is hopefully giving people a glimpse into where New York is heading, and the fact that frankly, we can activate a news cycle based upon social media is something that I think is very positive, generally. And it&#8217;s something that I hope to use to benefit New York when I&#8217;m mayor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gm.com/">General Motors</a> is joining the list of big automakers picking their horses in the race to develop better batteries for electric vehicles with its lead of a $139 million investment into the lithium-metal battery developer, <a href="https://www.ses.ai/">SES</a>.</p>
<p>Volkswagen <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210331005943/en/%C2%A0QuantumScape-Meets-Volkswagen-Technical-Milestone-Clearing-Way-for-100M-Investment#:~:text=QuantumScape%20Meets%20Volkswagen%20Technical%20Milestone%2C%20Clearing%20Way%20for%20%24100M%20Investment,-March%2031%2C%202021&amp;text=SAN%20JOSE%2C%20Calif.&amp;text=This%20will%20be%20the%20second,a%20total%20%24200%20million%20investment.">has QuantumScape</a>; Ford <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/ford-s-battery-bet-says-automotive-testing-will-start-in-2022#:~:text=Ford%20is%20weighing%20whether%20to,Jim%20Farley%20said%20last%20month.&amp;text=The%20company%20estimates%20its%20first,start%20producing%20cells%20in%202024.">has invested in SolidPower</a> (along with Hyundai and BMW); and now with SES&#8217; big backing from General Motors most of the big American and European automakers have placed their bets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are beyond R&amp;D development,&#8221; said SES chief executive Hu Qichao in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;The main purposes of this funding is to, one, mprove the key material, this lithium metal electrolyte on the anode side and the cathode side, and, two, to improve the scale of the current cell from the iPhone battery size to the size that can be used in cars.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a third component to the financing as well, Hu said, which is to increase the company&#8217;s algorithmic capabilities to monitor and manage cell performance. &#8220;It&#8217;s something that we and our OEM partners care about,&#8221; said Hu.</p>
<p>The investment from GM s the culmination of nearly six years of work with the big automaker, said Hu. &#8220;We started working with them in 2015. For the next three years we will go through the standard automation approval processes. Going from &#8216;A&#8217; sample to &#8216;B&#8217; sample all the way through &#8216;D&#8217; sample,&#8221; which is the final testing phase before commercial availability of SES&#8217; batteries in cars.</p>
<p>While Tesla, the current leader in electric vehicle sales in America, is looking to improve the form factors of its batteries to make them more powerful and more efficient, Hu said that the chemistry isn&#8217;t that different. Solid state batteries represent a step change in battery technology that makes batteries more powerful, easier to recycle, and potentially more stable.</p>
<p>As Mark Harris <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">wrote in TechCrunch</a> earlier earlier this year:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are many different kinds of SSB but they all lack a liquid electrolyte for moving electrons (electricity) between the battery’s positive (cathode) and negative (anode) electrodes. The liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries limit the materials the electrodes can be made from, and the shape and size of the battery. Because liquid electrolytes are usually flammable, lithium-ion batteries are also prone to runaway heating and even explosion. SSBs are much less flammable and can use metal electrodes or complex internal designs to store more energy and move it faster — giving higher power and faster charging.</p></blockquote>

<p>What SES is doing has brought the company attention not just from General Motors, but from previous investors including the battery giant<a href="http://eng.skinnovation.com/"> SK Innovation</a>; the Singapore-based, government-backed investment firm, Temasek; the venture capital arm of semiconductor manufacturer, Applied Materials, Applied Ventures; the Chinese automaking giant, Shanghai Auto; and investment firm, Vertex.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GM has been rapidly driving down battery cell costs and improving energy density, and our work with SES technology has incredible potential to deliver even better EV performance for customers who want more range at a lower cost,” said Matt Tsien, GM executive vice president and chief technology officer and president, GM Ventures. “This investment by GM and others will allow SES to accelerate their work and scale up their business.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic-induced lockdowns halted many a home decoration project, but the irony was that our homes became even more important. But where to get ideas to decorate? Home decor experts could no longer visit. Now an LA-based startup is addressing this digitization of the interior design market, but kicking off with a typically LA-oriented, high-end clientele.</p>
<p>The LA-based <a href="http://Theexpert.com">The Expert</a> &#8211; a platform for video consultations with interior designers &#8211; has raised a $3 million seed funding round led by Forerunner Ventures, with participation from Sweet Capital, Promus Ventures, Golden Ventures, Jeffrey Katzenberg’s WndrCo, AD 100 designer Brigette Romanek, and CEO.Founder of <a href="https://goop.com/">goop</a>, Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>
<p>The Expert offers 1:1 video consultations with leading interior designers, it says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founders consist of Jake Arnold, a celebrity interior designer (who has worked with John Legend, Rashida Jones, and Cameron Diaz among, others) and YC-alumni, Leo Seigal, who previously founded and sold Represent.com to CustomInk for $100m in 2015.</p>
<p>After being “inundated” with DMs during lockdown asking for his advice, Arnold says he realized he didn’t have the business model to help non-retainer clients. So he joined Seigal to create The Expert.</p>
<p>The Expert features 85 designers, so far. CLients click on their profiles to see rates and availability and then click to book. Clients can upload any relevant floor plans, images of the home, inspiration ideas etc for the designer to review ahead of time. They then join a zoom link (the platform uses the Zoom API) to meet with an interior designer and can leave a review afterward.</p>
<p>The company claims it has 700 designers on its waitlist and will hit $1m of bookings after its first quarter, after launching in early February this year.</p>
<p>The startup has some competition in the form of Modsy and Havenly, but The Expert says it is going for a more high-end experience, where clients are willing to pay $300-$2,500 for an hour of a designers’ time. The startup takes a 20% cut of the transaction.</p>
<p>Co-founder Leo Seigal said: “We were able to attract a crazy roster of designers partly thanks to co-founder Jake who is so highly regarded in the industry, and partly due to a timeliness of offering which is far above anything that has been tried in the home space.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Gwyneth Paltrow said: “I’ve always felt that access to great design – and those who create it – is too rare of a commodity. It’s a game-changer for someone without the budget for a full-time designer to have this roster of talent on speed dial.”</p>
<p>Nicole Johnson, Partner at Forerunner said: “We’ve been thinking through new models for the interior design sector for years at Forerunner, observing room for improvement for the trade and consumers alike. Interior design is arguably the ultimate, best-suited source of home inspiration and commerce enablement for consumers, but the trade is a famously walled garden. The Expert solves for this, connecting anyone, anywhere with the world’s leading interior designers via video consultation—allowing Experts to broaden their reach and monetization in a predictable, rewarding, and low-friction way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pippa Lamb, Partner at Sweet Capital who led their pre-seed investment round last summer said: “The Expert is democratizing access to top creators in the $150B global interior design industry. By partnering with leading talents like Amber Lewis and Leanne Ford, it&#8217;s solving both upstream discovery and downstream services: bringing Instagram feeds to life. Leo and his team are visionaries and Sweet Capital has been proud to back them since Day 1.”</p>
