										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen has entered into three new partnerships related to electric vehicle batteries, as the German automaker looks to transition its entire portfolio of cars, trucks and SUVs to zero-emission vehicles by 2040.</p>
<p>The three separate partnerships, all of which were announced Wednesday, are with materials technology group Umicore, battery specialist 24M Technologies and Vulcan Energy Resources, a company that is planning on opening a lithium brine project in Germany.</p>
<p>Volkswagen&#8217;s joint venture with Umicore will supply the automaker&#8217;s European battery cell factories with cathode materials, a key building block of lithium-ion batteries. The JV will have an initial production capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours, with the aim of scaling to up to 160 gigawatt-hours by 2030. The materials will feed VW’s planned Gigafactory in Salzgitter, Germany.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244811" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, Volkswagen said it was investing in battery start-up 24M, which is developing a battery that has a semi-solid electrode. The MIT spin-out says its manufacturing process is faster and less capital-intensive than conventional lithium-ion batteries. VW did not disclose the size of its investment.</p>
<p>The final partnership with Vulcan includes a binding contract for what the companies describe as &#8220;carbon neutral&#8221; lithium sourced from Germany. The companies say it is able to have carbon neutral lithium because the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">brine extraction process it is using is more environmentally-friendly than traditional brine extraction and it will be processed in a plant powered by renewable energy.</span></p>
<p>Vulcan will supply the automaker with lithium hydroxide for five years from 2026.</p>
<p>All three agreements are part of Volkswagen’s plan to invest €30 billion ($34 billion) in electric vehicles. In Europe alone, VW said it would build six battery gigafactories by the end of the decade, with a production capacity of 240 gigawatt-hours overall.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Volkswagen is not the only major automaker moving swiftly to secure the battery supply chain. Earlier this month, General Motors announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/gm-to-form-new-joint-venture-with-posco-chemical-aimed-at-key-battery-component/">a similar JV with South Korea’s POSCO Chemical</a> to build a new cathode materials facility in North America by 2024. Meanwhile, Stellantis secured its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/stellantis-locks-in-lithium-supply-agreement-to-secure-ev-battery-materials/">lithium intake agreement</a> with Vulcan last month.</p>
<p>The slew of deals is notable not only because it marks a ramp-up in automakers’ plans to electrify, but because such deals could help reshape the global battery supply chain away from China. Currently, the majority of battery cathodes and anodes are manufactured in that country, according to <a href="https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/china-controls-sway-of-electric-vehicle-power-through-battery-chemicals-cathode-and-anode-production/">Benchmark Mineral Intelligence</a>. Around 75%, or 148 of 200, planned lithium-ion megafactories <a href="https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/global-battery-arms-race-200-gigafactories-china-leads-2/">are also due to be located in China</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital identity startup <a href="https://passbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passbase</a>, which offers SDKs for running remote identity checks, has raised $10 million in Series A funding as it dials up attention on crypto compliance &#8212; touting tools to help fintechs with rapidly evolving regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The funding is led by Costanoa Ventures, with participation from Lakestar, Eniac Ventures, Cowboy Ventures and Seedcamp.</p>
<p>It follows an unannounced $3.5 million seed round &#8212; which almost doubled the $3.6 million in seed funding that Passbase raised back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/passbase-grabs-3-6m-to-power-privacy-preserving-online-id-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a>. So the 2018-founded startup&#8217;s total raised to date is around $17.7 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243213" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The digital identity space is a crowded one, but on the crypto compliance front Passbase is keen to point back to early experience and claim it as a differentiator &#8212; the team having started out building a cryptocurrency wallet before pivoting to identity authentication &#8212; which it argues helps it understand the needs of that particular (and some might say peculiar) industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our primary focus is on crypto,&#8221; says the startup, describing the typical customer for its SDKs as a &#8220;fast growing digital first financial services product, particularly fiat to crypto onramp services&#8221;.</p>
<p>Passbase&#8217;s subscription developer product provides tools to create a ve<span style="font-weight: 400;">rification flow and back-office compliance for regulatory needs such as AML (anti-money laundering), KYC (Know Your Customer) and age restrictions </span>&#8212; with different tiers targeted at startups, growth and enterprise users.</p>
<p>Its top-line claim is the product can be integrated in as little as 30 minutes, and covers more than 6,000 IDs across 190 countries and 15 languages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Passbase says it has around 180 customers for the dev product at this stage.</p>
<p>While, over the last year, it says revenue has grown 8x.</p>
<p>While the (hyper frothy) crypto market is where Passbase spies the biggest opportunity for its regulatory support tech, it also says it&#8217;s keeping an eye on developments around online age verification &#8212; an area that&#8217;s seeing rising attention from regulators in certain markets (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">such as the U.K.</a>) as a result of concerns around child safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Age verification is secondary priority but we have a few use cases such as online gaming, digital cannabis, online sale of e-cigarettes and online sales of alcohol&#8230; but we do continue to track regulations in age verification such as COPPA, the Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children Act, and others,&#8221; it told us.</p>
<p>Passbase says the Series A funding will be used for launching a new no-code policy system to allow customers to design their own onboarding flows for multiple regions and regulatory requirements &#8212; with the startup saying it has a big focus on scaling companies that are looking for compliance support as they expand into new markets and geographies.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will solve the need for companies to both understand what they need to do to comply in different markets (i.e. through policy templates) and manage how to do it (i.e. workflows within our verification product),&#8221; Passbase suggests of the incoming policy tools.</p>
<p>Expanding the system&#8217;s capabilities to provide what it bills as &#8220;market-optimized onboarding solutions for different geographies and use cases&#8221; is another slated aim.</p>
<p>Its overarching vision is to be a key player in a digital identity network comprised of a sharable KYC token and verifiable credential model &#8212; which it argues will enable &#8220;a privacy preserving identity ecosystem&#8221;, as envisaged by the decentralized identity model now being hyped as &#8220;web3&#8221;.</p>
<p>However there are a number of (rather better) resourced startups also selling identity verification tools &#8212; Passbase names <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/">Jumio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/onfido-the-ai-based-id-verification-platform-raises-100m-led-by-tpg/">Onfido</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/persona-lands-50m-for-identity-verification-after-seeing-10x-yoy-revenue-growth/">Persona</a> and <a href="https://www.veriff.com/blog/veriff-secures-69m-in-series-b-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veriff</a> as its closest competitors.</p>
<p>Notably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/stripe-goes-beyond-payments-with-stripe-identity-to-provide-ai-based-id-verification-for-transactions-and-much-more/">Stripe also recently added ID checks</a> &#8212; launching into the space this summer and creating a fresh layer of competition for AI-powered verification via a self-serve tool.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CNRcwToQbH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/stripe-goes-beyond-payments-with-stripe-identity-to-provide-ai-based-id-verification-for-transactions-and-much-more/">Stripe goes beyond payments with Stripe Identity to provide AI-based ID verification for transactions and much more</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stripe goes beyond payments with Stripe Identity to provide AI-based ID verification for transactions and much more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/stripe-goes-beyond-payments-with-stripe-identity-to-provide-ai-based-id-verification-for-transactions-and-much-more/embed/#?secret=CNRcwToQbH" data-secret="CNRcwToQbH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Stripe&#8217;s arrival obviously causes a big headache for all the startups founded on dreams of becoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/passbase-grabs-3-6m-to-power-privacy-preserving-online-id-checks/">&#8220;Stripe for identity verification</a>&#8221; (which was literally how Passbase was talking about its business back in 2019).</p>
<p>But despite fierce competition on core ID checks, Passbase isn&#8217;t throwing in the towel &#8212; it&#8217;s just betting on specializing in crypto compliance needs (and there being a market for specialized crypto compliance tools) instead. Hence its marketing thrust now talks about bringing &#8220;KYC to crypto&#8221; &#8212; and stays silent on the arrival of Stripe on its turf &#8212; again arguing that its early experience in crypto and web3 provides a competitive edge for the crypto niche it&#8217;s now zeroing in on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s important to remember, our team came from the web3 and crypto space with Coinance. We understand the needs of web3 better than anyone in the IDV [identity verification] space. These competitors existed when we were looking for solutions and there is a reason we didn’t choose them,&#8221; it argues, dialling up the crypto hype.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our seed round got us to table stakes to be a competitive solution in IDV, with improvements such as more flexible pricing for scaling companies, a more user-friendly verification flow, deeper customization for product leaders and better documentation so developers can integrate in minutes, not weeks. The Series A is about taking the next step towards an accessible global compliance solution and the decentralized identity model web3 was built to facilitate.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.synthesia.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synthesia</a>, a startup using AI to create synthetic videos, is walking a fine, but thus far prosperous, line between being creepy and being pretty freakin&#8217; cool.</p>
<p>Today, it announced the close of a $50 million Series B funding round led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from GV and existing investors Firstmark Capital, LDV Capital, Seedcamp and MMC Ventures.</p>
<p>Synthesia allows anyone to turn text or a slide deck presentation into a video, complete with a talking avatar. Customers can leverage existing avatars, created from the performance of actors, or create their own in minutes by uploading some video. Users also can upload a recording of their voice, which can be transformed to say just about anything under the sun.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244759" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup, aware of the fact that almost any powerful tool on the internet can be used for evil, is focusing exclusively on enterprise clients, rather than allowing anyone and everyone to hop on the platform. These customers predominantly use the tool for training videos, it said, but also use Synthesia for monthly updates to the broader team or delivering information that would normally come via email.</p>
<p>Interestingly, founder <a href="https://twitter.com/vriparbelli?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victor Riparbelli</a> said that user behavior didn&#8217;t necessarily match up to his earlier expectations. Rather than seeing tons of usage from video production departments, other folks inside the organization are the power users of the tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who, before Synthesia, could produce a slide deck or write a Word document can now actually create video content,&#8221; said Riparbelli. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s the key thing that is making us grow so fast from an AI perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since raising a $12.5 million Series A in April, Synthesia has added features that make it even easier for users to create their own animated talkers, and the platform now has 1,000 custom avatars in use. Riparbelli cited Ernst &amp; Young as an example customer. The firm has 35 partners with their own avatars, creating videos for both internal comms and client communication.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Synthesia&#8217;s AI video generation platform hooks $12.5 million Series A led by FirstMark&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/synthesias-ai-video-generation-platform-hooks-12-5-million-series-a-led-by-firstmark/embed/#?secret=QVWm4T0HIO" data-secret="QVWm4T0HIO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The &#8220;anyone can make video&#8221; concept gives me very strong Canva vibes. The $40 billion Australian startup shot up like a rocket after unlocking the ability to design &#8212; anything &#8212; for the rest of the organization outside of the design department. Canva also launched its own video product recently, focusing more on turning existing designs and slide decks into animated, lively videos.</p>
<p>The startup takes that a step further with the ability to create videos featuring an avatar that looks and feels like a real person, either an unknown actor or the CEO of your own company.</p>
<p>Synthesia isn&#8217;t the only company doing work in its problem space. An Israeli company called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/d-id/">D-ID</a> actually demo&#8217;d their tech at Disrupt 2021, showing how they can take a still image of a person and turn it into video content.</p>
<p>In other words, the race is on, in a few ways. Companies looking to make video creation easier through AI and avatars must not only race to increase realism and add in a sliding scale for emotional expression, etc., but they must also ensure the safety of users and the credibility of their own platforms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s plain as day to see how these types of tools could be used to mislead or do harm to large numbers of people, and it&#8217;s up to the companies creating these tools to ensure they&#8217;re used in an above board fashion.</p>
<p>For Synthesia&#8217;s part, the company is pretty clear about not synthesizing anyone without explicit consent, and the tech is only accessible via an on-rails experience fully controlled by the company.</p>
<p>All that said, don&#8217;t be surprised to see a video from your department head or CEO, but not <em>quite </em>them, in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/polestar/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><ins>Polestar</ins></a> has <a href="https://media.polestar.com/global/en/media/pressreleases/642344" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>released</ins></a> an over-the-air update that boosts the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-ev-drive-video-133035906.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><ins>Polestar 2&#8217;s</ins></a> torque and horsepower. It bumps up the EV&#8217;s oomph to 469 horsepower (an increase of 67hp) and 502 lb. ft of torque, an increase of 15.</p>
<p>In practical terms, Polestar says those upgrades shave around a tenth of a second off the 0-60 MPH acceleration time, which is <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/43418/polestar-2-gains-67-hp-from-ota-update-and-this-is-how-its-going-to-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1"><ins>down to 4.4 seconds</ins></a>. The company suggests the biggest acceleration boost will be found in the mid-range. It claims that going from 50 to 75 MPH will take 2.2 seconds, which is around half a second faster than the typical Polestar 2 setup.</p>
<p>The update isn&#8217;t free, however. It&#8217;s available in the Polestar Extras store for eligible cars in the UK, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Denmark, Germany and Austria, and it costs around €1,000 ($1,130). Polestar plans to offer the update in the US and Canada in the spring, with pricing to be announced later.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244793" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Polestar isn&#8217;t the only automaker to increase EV performance via over-the-air updates. Tesla has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-y-acceleration-boost-174341431.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1"><ins>also offered</ins></a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-3-owners-quicker-164500702.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1"><ins>paid updates</ins></a> that boost acceleration in some models, such as Model 3 and Model Y.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After months of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/roku-alleges-google-is-using-its-monopoly-power-in-youtube-tv-carriage-negotiations/">nasty</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/">contract</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/roku-warns-customers-contract-negotiations-with-youtube-have-failed/">disputes</a>, Roku this morning announced it&#8217;s come to an agreement with Google which will allow it to continue to carry both YouTube and YouTube TV on its platform. Roku declined to share the specifics of the deal terms, beyond saying it&#8217;s a multi-year extension that covers both services.</p>
<p>For Roku and Google customers, however, that means they don&#8217;t know which party won the battle or what that means for Google&#8217;s access to Roku&#8217;s user data. During the spat, Roku brought to public attention how Google was allegedly demanding elevated access to customer data which Roku had then described as &#8220;outside the realm&#8221; of industry-standard practices. It said Google wanted more user data than Roku offered its other customers.</p>
<p>Roku also said that Google had threatened to retaliate by increasing the hardware spec requirements for YouTube TV if it didn&#8217;t get its way. That would have meant Roku&#8217;s low-end players would no longer have access to the service.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244777" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These are hefty complaints. And in the case of the user data-sharing agreements, it seems customers should have the right to know where the decision ended up.</p>
<p>It may be easier to spot which side won when it comes to Roku&#8217;s other allegations, however. Roku had said Google wanted preferential treatment of YouTube content in Roku search results and had wanted to override Roku customers&#8217; default settings when the YouTube app was open. For example, if a Roku customer had YouTube open and used voice search to ask for music, Google wanted YouTube Music to play the request, even if the customer had set Pandora as their preferred music app. This should be easy enough to test out when the new agreements go into effect.</p>
<p>Roku had hauled the details of the backroom negotiations into the public in an attempt to gain an upper hand in the disputes, ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/roku-warns-customers-contract-negotiations-with-youtube-have-failed/">warning customers in October</a> that negotiations had failed &#8212; and that customers may lose access to YouTube TV as a result.</p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, had dismissed Roku&#8217;s claims as &#8220;baseless,&#8221; and denied it had asked for elevated access to user data or to interfere with Roku search results. The comapny also suggested Roku was attempting to use these allegations (which had a whiff of an antitrust nature to them) as a means to renegotiate a separate deal for the main YouTube app. Given that the new agreement now covers both services, one has to wonder if Roku was successful on that front.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Roku spokesperson shared the following statement about the new deal:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Roku and Google have agreed to a multi-year extension for both YouTube and YouTube TV. This agreement represents a positive development for our shared customers, making both YouTube and YouTube TV available for all streamers on the Roku platform.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, a Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We’re happy to share that we’ve reached a deal with Roku to continue distributing the YouTube and YouTube TV apps on Roku devices. This means that Roku customers will continue to have access to YouTube and that the YouTube TV app will once again be available in the Roku store for both new and existing members. We are pleased to have a partnership that benefits our mutual users.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Google also declined to comment on the nature of the data-sharing agreements under the new contract, only referring back to prior statements it made where it had denied Roku&#8217;s allegations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[NewtonX developed search engine technology to match questions to only those who would know the answer among an open network of over 1 billion professionals.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everyday business decisions require data and are often questions someone has already asked and had answered. However, where all of that knowledge lives is not always accessible if you aren’t in research or have a panel of experts. <a href="https://www.newtonx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NewtonX</a> wants to change that.</p>
<p>The business-to-business insights company on Wednesday announced $32 million in Series B funding to continue developing its tool aimed at democratizing access to high-quality data and research.</p>
<p>The round was led by Marbruck Ventures and included Level One, the UBS O’Connor fund, Gaingels and Heliad Partners. Existing investors Two Sigma, Third Prime, XFund, Story Ventures and Switch also participated. The latest investment gives NewtonX a total amount raised of $47 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We profiled the company back in 2019 when it announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/two-sigma-leads-12m-series-a-for-expert-knowledge-network-newtonx/">$12 million Series A round</a>, but the premise behind the company is that it developed search engine technology to match questions to only those who would know the answer among an open network of more than 1 billion professionals. It also ensures every professional is verified so there is true expertise.</p>
<p>Sascha Eder, co-founder and CEO of NewtonX told TechCrunch that the company was very close to the path of profitability, but decided to take on the new capital to prioritize growth. It used the Series A funding to invest in technology, and now wants to take that technology to the next level, bringing in automation and artificial intelligence, so that answers will come faster, thus transforming into an enterprise scalable-grade company to handle any future growth.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, the company also built out its marketing and sales teams for more brand awareness and partnerships. A big part of the Series B will go even deeper to build out a product suite, which will require additional marketing, sales and engineering hires, Eder said.</p>
<p>“For the first four years of our company, we didn’t have a sales team, which is different from other startups, but we can say we had a product market first from day one,” he added. “We provided the right solutions and a lot of organic growth, and now it is time to take that to the next level with a strategic approach to awareness and expansion globally.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>NewtonX works with more than 200 companies, like Pinterest, and Fortune 500 consulting firms, financial institutions, market research firms and mid-sized companies. The company is growing 100% year over year and has plans to grow from 80 employees today to over 200 by the end of 2022, Eder said. It had been at 45 employees around this time last year.</p>
<p>Even venture capitalists need access to insights, an additional reason that made the company attractive, Kemper Shaw at Marbruck Ventures said in a written statement.</p>
<p>“In just five years NewtonX has established itself as the leader in B2B research and is used by the world’s leading companies that trust NewtonX to get the data they need to make multi-million dollar decisions,” Shaw said. “Their knowledge graph and custom recruiting automation allows them to connect business leaders to insights they previously could not access or where they had to question the validity of the data, NewtonX solved this problem and will be a critical part of companies’ competitive edge in the years to come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a field that ranges from text therapy and AI chat bots, to guided meditation, </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01100-y"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mental health startups are pursuing a different niche: therapy for kids. And kids only. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HelloHero, a company focused on teletherapy for kids up to 21 years old  (the average user is 10 years old), announced a $7.7 million dollar seed round on Wednesday, with a $4.5 million line of credit from Silicon Valley Bank. This round of funding follows a rebrand for the company, and plans to dive deep into data-driven teletherapy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HelloHero is the brainchild of founder Syed Mohammed, who struggled with dyslexia as a child, but wasn’t diagnosed until adulthood. After benefitting from therapy as an adult, he has focused on building out a teletherapy program offered through schools or directly to families. That platform was initially called Enable My Child (founded in 2018). But the company has recently rebranded to HelloHero. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243418" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, HelloHero has provided teletherapy for 3,800 children total, about 1800 of whom have been served this school year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HelloHero isn’t the only player in the teletherapy for kids space (</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/dotcom-therapy-raises-13m-to-provide-therapy-for-kids-in-and-out-of-school/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotCom Therapy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company founded 2015 to provide therapy through school districts closed a $13 million round this year as well). Although HelloHero does hit some similar notes seen in other teletherapy companies (largely, leveraging clinical expertise to get therapists into schools that may not have them), it&#8217;s approach is very technology-focused. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohammed has spent a lot of time thinking about about using technology to improve therapy itself, and building tools to connect schools, insurance companies, and parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;ve built here is the healthcare system that is connected to payers; that is connected to their families and children; that is connected to therapists,” Mohammed told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any child who uses HelloHero begins with a treatment plan established by a therapist. After every session of therapy delivered using HelloHero, therapists and parents are asked to evaluate the clinical progress a child is making. All of that data is collected by HelloHero’s platform, which, as Mohammed explains, is used to tweak the plan from week to week.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have generationally improved how progress is tracked,” argues Mohammed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not the only benefit of collecting information this way. Session-level data that links therapy to clinical progress (or lack thereof) has already proved to be a powerful asset for companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a vastly larger scale, ieso, a UK-based text-therapy company which closed a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/uk-based-mental-health-provider-ieso-raises-53m-armed-with-an-unprecedented-dataset/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$53 million Series B round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November, has also asked participants to evaluate their progress over the course of treatment. The result is a massive dataset linking certain therapeutic techniques to clinical outcomes (which has resulted in published research). That dataset has become a major attraction point for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HelloHero appears to be building an outcomes-linked dataset of its own, and has aims to using it to provide more automated therapeutic tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohammed plans to develop a data-informed tool to guide therapists through their own sessions. It would provide advice in real time on a therapists’ screen while in-session, based on what has worked (and not worked) before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In HelloHero&#8217;s current platform, advice is already provided before or after sessions are completed, says Mohammed. But the company plans to bring real-time “on-screen intelligence” to life within the next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from on-screen intelligence, HelloHero has looked to set its platform apart on the backend. HelloHero has built its own electronic medical record system, and a payer platform that’s “connected” to private insurers and Medicaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I asked our Chief Technology Officer, how much code do we really have, and he explained it: think about us like a regional bank. That’s how big our technology is,&#8221; Mohammed said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as the therapy itself goes, HelloHero has two arms of the business: the first is based on direct collaborations with schools. The company is in contract with 500 school districts, and more than 100 are actively providing therapy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second arm is a direct to family program, which offers specialized courses for kids and parents (programs include screen time management, or feeding difficulties, as examples). Now, the direct to family programs constitute about 8-10 percent of the business, says Mohammed. Going forward the company plans to invest more in this aspect of the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for this round, the company also plans to focus on recruiting expertise in three areas: insurance integration, child psychology, and technology. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You will be excused if you haven&#8217;t heard of <a href="http://wiz.io">Wiz</a>, an 18 month old Israeli security startup from Microsoft Azure vets, but it has already been turning heads by raising $550 million on a $6 billion valuation. (No, that is not a typo).</p>
<p>Wiz started out by creating an agentless tool to scan across the range of cloud tooling from virtual machines to containers to serverless, says Raaz Herzberg, Wiz&#8217;s head of product.&#8221;When we think about the tools organizations started from deploying in the cloud, most were not cloud native. We basically took the cloud API&#8217;s and worked our way to doing a full scan, and that has never been done before,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Today, the company introduced a new product called Wiz Guardrails designed to create a single security policy to protect code from creation to production, essentially extending the coverage of the original product from the cloud infrastructure to the development pipeline.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244761" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are releasing something today…I honestly believe will transform the way organizations do cloud security by basically enabling them to extend that type of solidified scan across any architecture type and any cloud, and also extending that across the full development pipeline,&#8221; Herzberg told me.</p>
<p>The way it works is that admins can define the security policy they want to apply to the code in the pipeline. As the code moves through the production cycle, it continually checks it for anything that falls outside of compliance and flags it for fixing before it becomes a problem. Once in production, it can continue to monitor the code for compliance with the policies.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Assaf Rappaport went to Microsoft when it bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/microsoft-confirms-purchase-of-cloud-security-firm-adallom/">his previous startup Adallom</a>, which helped secure SaaS products. He claims to have helped build this to a $2 billion business before heading off on his own again in March 2020, a particularly inopportune time to launch a new company.</p>
<p>But it didn&#8217;t seem to hurt him as the company has managed to raise gobs of money at a gaudy $6 billion valuation just 9 months after releasing its first product. He says that the market has accelerated due to COVID pushing companies to the cloud faster, something we have heard from many companies since 2020.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the founder&#8217;s track record also helped instill confidence in investors, who often look for people who have built startups to successful exits, and finally Rappaport says that they have managed to attract Fortune 500 and 100 companies quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that market opportunity combined with the pace of what we created, I would say [explains] the hype and the excitement from investors about Wiz,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta (formerly Facebook) today is introducing a new &#8220;Professional&#8221; mode for user profiles, designed to be used by creators looking to monetize their followings on the social network. The new mode, which is initially available to select creators in the U.S., will present creators with additional money-making opportunities and expanded insights that had been previously only available to Facebook Pages.</p>
<p>Among these will be the ability for creators to participate in the new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/programs/bonuses">Reels Play bonus program</a>, where some creators are able to earn up to $35,000 per month based on the views for their short-form video content. However, access to this program, for the time being, is invite-only &#8212; meaning Meta will determine which creators qualify to earn bonuses.</p>
<p>While Meta didn&#8217;t share what other monetization options will be available in the days ahead, it did note that it will also make professional-level insights available to these creators which are similar to what Page owners have access to. This includes access to post, audience, and profile insights. For example, creators will be able to now see the total number of shares, reactions, and comments that their posts have and be able to view their follower growth over time. This allows them to make better, more informed decisions about the content they post and how it resonates with their audience.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244763" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2244775" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244775" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244775" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="618" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png 1188w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?resize=300,273 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?resize=768,698 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?resize=680,618 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Professional-mode.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244775" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meta</p></div></p>
<p>While many creators are already using Facebook profiles instead of Pages to attract fans and followers, Meta warns that others who decide to opt into this new experience will be opening themselves up to being more of a public figure on the social network. That means anyone can follow them and see the public content posted to their feed, but they&#8217;ll be able to mark posts as either public or friends-only, as you could otherwise on a private profile.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, creators who are using Facebook Pages will be opted into the new Pages experience instead This will provide access to a Professional Dashboard that will serve as a central destination for admins to review the Page&#8217;s performance and access professional tools and insights, the company notes. Facebook is also testing a two-step composer on Pages which allows creators to schedule posts and cross-post into a group.</p>
<p>The changes come at a time when Meta is heavily investing in its creator user base, as it sees the potential in a new revenue stream that comes from things like creator subscriptions and virtual tips, aka &#8220;Stars&#8221; &#8212; the latter which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/facebooks-new-website-lets-fans-buy-stars-without-paying-the-app-stores-commissions/">it just made available</a> yesterday outside the app stores through a new website where it no longer has to pay commissions to Apple and Google. The company earlier said it was planning to lure in creators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">with $1 billion in payments</a>, like the Reels bonuses among other things, as the competition for creator talent heats up with TikTik and other top social apps, like YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat, and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meta notes that the new Professional mode is still in testing with select creators in the U.S. for now, but will roll out more broadly in the future, including to the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/introducing-new-tools-to-support-facebook-creators-in-emea/">EMEA region</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During the good number of hours I’ve spent researching and writing about vertical farming in recent months, one key word keeps popping up: proximity. So many of the resources spent on modern farming are devoted to transporting produce long stretches, ramping up carbon footprints in the process. Gotham Greens isn’t vertical farming, exactly, but it has become a poster child for locally grown agriculture, courtesy of its urban greenhouse that sits directly atop a Whole Foods in Gowanus Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old company currently has three New York City locations (two in Brooklyn and one in Queens), two additional farms on the East Coast (Baltimore and Providence), a pair in the Midwest (Chicago) and one in the Mountain region (Denver). Today, it announced further westward expansion with the opening of its first California greenhouse, based just outside UC Davis.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243772" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243772" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243772" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg 3500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=2048,1534 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_4.jpg.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243772" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gotham Greens</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243770" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gotham’s ninth location is a 10-acre farm designed to dramatically reduce the resources required to grow produce. Using its hydroponic technology, the company says it’s capable of reducing the standard 10 gallons of water required to grow a head of lettuce to less than a single gallon. Overall, it claims the farm will be able to save 270 million gallons of water a year, while occupying 300 fewer acres than traditional farming practices.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting move, heading to California, where so much of the nation’s produce is grown &#8212; and certainly a different tactic that opening a location in New York City or Chicago. Of course, in spite of California’s proud tradition of growing, the state has been plagued by the very real devastation of climate change.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243773" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243773" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2243773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="767" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg 3500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=2048,1535 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Gotham-Greens-Davis-Exterior_Credit-Gotham-Greens_1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gotham Greens</p></div></p>
<p>“California is the center of North America’s leafy greens production, where water shortages, wildfires and other results of climate change are straining critical agricultural resources. By putting down roots in California, we aspire to be a part of the agricultural industry’s solution to the increasingly visible impacts of climate change,” co-founder and CEO Viraj Puri said in a release. “Our newest greenhouse facility in Northern California is strategically located to service retailers and food service providers throughout the region more quickly while conserving precious resources, including land and water.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The proximity to UCD was no mistake, either. The company will be partnering with researchers from the school and will likely have a solid pipeline of future employees. The company also used the opportunity to announce plans to reduce the plastic in its packaging 40% (versus 2020) and electricity use 5% by the year 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">Samsara IPO heading toward pricing</a>, it&#8217;s a good moment to spend a little more time digging into the IoT market. There&#8217;s a lot more going on than merely the liquidity point of one of its players, it turns out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.afero.io/">Afero</a>, for example, closed a $50 million Series C today, led by <a href="https://crosspointcapital.com/">Crosspoint Capital Partners</a>. The new capital raise is roughly equivalent to all the capital that Afero raised prior to its latest round, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/afero/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>, implying that the startup now has more cash on hand than at any point prior.</p>
<p>After being slightly surprised at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/iot-data-collector-samsaras-ipo-will-be-fun-to-watch/">how large Samsara&#8217;s own IoT-focused business had grown</a> while we weren&#8217;t watching, TechCrunch got ahold of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-britt">Afero CEO Joe Britt</a> and <a href="https://crosspointcapital.com/team/hugh-thompson/">Crosspoint&#8217;s Hugh Thompson</a> to chat more about its business and why it chose this moment to raise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244738" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>What does Afero do?</h2>
<p>Per Britt, when his team was putting Afero together, they noted projections indicating that the number of connected devices in the world was going to scale by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Given that anticipated boom in connected gadgets, sensors and the like, Afero&#8217;s IoT platform was built with security in mind. That might sound intuitive, but Britt argues that the web was not initially compiled with security as a top priority, which has led to round after round of issues surrounding breaches and hacks.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to connect our lives and businesses to the internet on an ambient basis, security is going to be a pretty darn big deal. Else your toaster or production is going to get hacked.</p>
<p>Thompson, who has a background in security work, stressed how important that stance was to his interest in investing in the company, saying that the startup is &#8220;rare&#8221; in having &#8220;built things right [in security terms] from the very beginning.&#8221; (Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker">TechCrunch&#8217;s Zack Whittaker</a>, I am more aware than ever of how frequently major companies are compromised, making me sympathetic to arguments of the importance of building with a security-first mindset.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Afero&#8217;s IoT platform also includes a software development toolkit (SDK) for customer companies to build mobile apps on top of, as well as the ability to tailor itself to customer use cases.</p>
<p>In practice, the startup works with companies like Home Depot to bring connected devices to markets like the smart home segment. According to Britt and Thompson, the company&#8217;s platform can also support offline items like tagged physical goods to help track supply chains.</p>
<h2>Why raise now?</h2>
<p>Of all the startups that I have spoken to after raising a Series C, Afero is the smallest in terms of full-time staffing with just 24 people. Obviously, the company is going to do some hiring with its new capital. It also plans to invest in its go-to-market efforts &#8212; more spending on marketing, sales and so forth.</p>
<p>Asked by TechCrunch how large the company&#8217;s in-market footprint is today, Afero&#8217;s CEO declined to share a specific number, and after trying to find a way to explain general scale without being too precise, he simply said that there are &#8220;a lot&#8221; of Afero-connected devices in the world. Normally we&#8217;d complain a bit about a lack of hard numbers, but given that the startup&#8217;s customers might not want it to disclose how many of their devices sit atop Afero&#8217;s platform, it makes some sense.</p>
<p>In time, when Afero has a wider customer base, we&#8217;ll expect more specificity.</p>
<p>A few years back, we might have been skeptical of the scale of the market that Afero is tackling, but Samsara&#8217;s growth changed our general perspective.</p>
<p>The soon-to-be public company&#8217;s platform collects IoT data from real-world business operations, allowing for the creation of an application layer atop data sourced from sensors. Samsara&#8217;s revenues of $113.8 million last quarter provide proof of market demand for IoT platforms more generally.</p>
<p>Afero&#8217;s best-known partnership has more of a consumer flavor &#8212; Home Depot&#8217;s HubSpace line is geared toward the public &#8212; than what Samsara has built, so the two are not direct competitors today. We&#8217;re not trying to say that Afero is coming after Samsara or the other way around. At least not yet.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we&#8217;ll be curious to see how many new customer companies Afero can land in the next few quarters &#8212; and how soon it will scale to the point that it&#8217;s comfortable sharing harder metrics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a> is a company that works directly with developers, so having an in-house investment arm that helps these developers who are building companies on top of Twilio, makes a lot of sense. Today the communications API company announced the launch of <a href="http://www.twilio.com/ventures">Twilio Ventures</a>, a $50 million fund created to invest in companies using Twilio or who are working on innovative adjacent ideas.</p>
<p>Bryan Vaniman, senior vice president of corporate development, who is in charge of the new investment arm, came over from Adobe in March with a mission to build a fund and start investing. He says that having a funding mechanism like this, which many companies do, is a natural extension of the mission of the company to empower developers with tools to build applications faster.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really about championing developers and startups that are building the next generation of customer engagement applications. We just think it&#8217;s a really natural extension of what we do being a developer-first company from the outset,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244523" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the company has shifted to customer-oriented applications with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/"> the $3.2 billion acquisition of Segment</a> last year, customer experience has become a big part of the focus for Twilio Ventures as they look for companies to fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;First and foremost, we see this as an opportunity to expand our reach and impacts within that ecosystem by supporting exciting companies that are building the next generation of capabilities for developers and customer engagement applications,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company will typically invest in Series A rounds, but will go later or earlier if the company is a good match, he said. Typically the checks are in the $1M to $3M range.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve already invested in several companies that have a lot in common with Twilio, as you would expect. &#8220;If you look at the handful of investments we&#8217;ve made, <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> is a great example of a company that shares a very similar developer personal ethos to us. They&#8217;ve developed a set of API&#8217;s that enable developers to build amazing kinds of search recommendation experiences,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Although they aren&#8217;t able to share exact investment amounts with these companies, he says that they are secondary strategic investors. The plan is to act as helpful partners and offer these companies access to internal resources and help with sales and marketing, but they will not have a board seat in most cases.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s possible that they could consider acquiring some of the companies that they are investing in, that is not the primary goal of the fund. &#8220;That would be more of an ancillary benefit. It&#8217;s not the primary rationale for the program, but the benefit of investing and getting closer to companies and building relationships is that there&#8217;s potential for that to lead to a deeper relationship down the road, but that would not be the primary focus,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Other SaaS companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-private-investment-cools-enterprise-startups-may-try-tapping-corporate-dollars/">take a similar approach</a> building an investment arm including Salesforce, Zoom, Hubspot, Workday and Okta.</p>

That’s up from a $2 billion valuation at the time of its $150 million Series [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tipalti.com/en-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipalti</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, once a fintech unicorn, is now nearing decacorn status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which automates accounts payables for mid-market companies, announced today that it has raised $270 million in a Series F funding round that values the company at $8.3 billion. That’s up from a $2 billion valuation at the time of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/tipalti-receives-150m-at-a-2b-valuation-after-its-accounts-payable-platform-sees-a-surge-in-use/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$150 million Series E round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Tipalti uses artificial intelligence to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help businesses manage suppliers, invoices, purchase orders, tax compliance, payments and billing and other accounting services from a single cloud platform. It claims to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce companies’ operational workload by 80% by giving them the ability to pay partners and vendors in “within minutes.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244637" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, the company is focused on mid-market businesses, which are defined as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">those with revenues between $10 million and $1 billion.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. alone, mid-market companies acco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unt for </span><a href="https://www.middlemarketcenter.org/ncmm-annual-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a third of employment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://rsmus.com/economics.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 40 percent of GDP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another large player in the space, Bill.com, is focused more on SMBs. That company went public in December 2019 and is currently trading at $</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">254.76</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, significantly higher than the $22 a share it priced its shares at the time of its IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the market has a proper appreciation for the size of market opportunity we’re facing,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO and co-founder Chen Amit. “Our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiples over the last 12 months have increased because of that new appreciation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">G-Squared led Tipalti’s latest round, which also included “significant” investments from new backers Marshall Wace as well as funds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and accounts managed by Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), in addition to current investors Zeev Ventures, Durable Capital Partners, 01 Advisors and others. The financing brings the company’s total raised since its 2010 inception to $550 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipalti’s new valuation &#8212; more than quadruple that of its last &#8212; catapults the San Mateo, California-based startup to among the most valuable private fintech companies in the world, according to </span><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-250-startups-most-promising/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB Insights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what has it done to warrant such a jump? A few things, according to Amit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, it currently processes over $30 billion in total annual payments volume — growing 120% year over year. It also recently passed the 2,000 customer mark. Those customers include Roblox, Amazon Twitch, GoDaddy, Roku, WordPress.com and ZipRecruiter, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some context, at the time of its Series E raise in October 2020, Tipalti said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it had seen transaction volume on its platform balloon to $12 billion, up 80% from the year prior. It then had some 1,000 customers on its books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this year, Tipalti opened new offices in London, Plano, Texas, and Toronto Ontario, and has grown to 720 employees worldwide compared to 350 last year. It also launched “enhanced capabilities,” including the </span><a href="https://tipalti.com/pr20210412/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquisition and integration of cloud procurement solutions provider Approve.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enhanced multi-entity AP capabilities, virtual cards, mobile and added new integrations with complementary financial tech stack providers such as expense management companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s just the beginning, according to Amit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This latest investment will enable Tipalti to add more to our product lines and capabilities in the next 18 months than we have over the past 10 years combined,” he said. “The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">broader challenge of financial operations for high growth and mid-market companies encompasses many problems and challenges they have and that creates more opportunity for us to monetize.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipalti will also use its new capital in part on customer operations, as well as toward a global expansion. It also plans to hire across its product, engineer and sales and marketing teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expect to double our go-to-market team next year,” Amit told TechCrunch. “The addressable market we have today is around 700,000 companies with very little penetration between us and the few other players in the market. So we want to reachout to more of these prospects.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Aschebrook, founder &amp; managing partner of G Squared, said in a written statement that his firm believes that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipalti is reshaping how businesses manage their financial operations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their growth and industry-leading retention rates are evidence that they are on a mission to solve important challenges for their customers,” Aschebrook added. “We see a huge opportunity in the target market that is largely underserved currently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his view</span><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipalti has approached a complex and often low-tech set of essential business processes and “meticulously crafted a solution with simplicity at its core.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Bird, the shared micromobility company that recently went public by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/">merging with a special purpose acquisition company</a>, has launched two new kick scooters for sale. The Bird Flex, a foldable personal e-scooter costing $599, and the Birdie Glow, a three-wheel scooter for kids that costs $99, will add to the company&#8217;s small but growing suite of consumer micromobility vehicles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These two new scooters, along with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/shared-micromobility-company-bird-launches-a-consumer-electric-bike-for-2299/">Bird Bike the company launched back in August</a>, will be available for direct-to-consumer purchases or through retail giant Target. The vehicles are only being sold in the U.S. at the moment, but Bird told TechCrunch it hopes to start selling the new scooters in Europe next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the fact that vehicle sales only made up a small percentage of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/birds-first-public-earnings-show-missed-q3-revenue-but-potential-for-full-year-growth/">Bird&#8217;s Q3 top line revenue</a> at 2.1%, the company appears to be trying to build out its hardware sales unit at a time when sales of personal micromobility vehicles are on the rise. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/why-micromobility-is-here-to-stay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December McKinsey study</a> on micromobility found 70% of participants would be willing to ride a micromobility vehicle to work.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244571" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Bird would not share how many retail products it has sold so far, nor how much top line revenue it expects to receive from retail sales.</p>
<div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234437" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto">“As interest in shared and personal electric vehicles grows across the country, we are continuing to expand our offerings of eco-friendly transportation products to meet the needs of riders at every age and at a variety of price points,” said Brian Buccella, SVP of consumer products and government partnerships at Bird, in a statement. “We know that people are looking to micro electric vehicles to replace gas-powered car trips to get around their cities. With a full suite of personal micromobility devices, we can help expand the reach and access to eco-friendly transportation.”</div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The Bird Flex, which is recommended for riders age 16 and up, follows in the footsteps of the Bird Air, Bird&#8217;s first personal electric kick scooter. The price point between them is the same, as are many metrics of the vehicles. In fact, the Flex has a marginally slower top speed at 15 miles per hour, versus Air&#8217;s 16 miles per hour, and less range at 15 miles of range, versus Air&#8217;s 16 miles of range, although a spokesperson for Bird told TechCrunch the battery is slightly larger in the Flex than the Air. Perhaps it&#8217;s the &#8220;larger and more rugged build&#8221; of the Flex that equates bigger battery to less range.</p>
<p>Flex specs include street-tested front-wheel suspension, a 350W brushless Hall motor, a wider base, longer platform and 10-inch diameter puncture-proof tires. It also comes with an integrated LED display which shows speed and battery life. The Flex is foldable, and it weighs just under 50 pounds.</p>
<p>The Birdie Glow is pretty much the same as Bird&#8217;s original Birdie, <a href="https://www.bird.co/it/blog/meet-birdie-birds-new-three-wheel-kids-scooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which the company launched in 2019</a>, except that this one has light-up wheels. That&#8217;ll get the kiddos! It&#8217;s designed for children aged three to eight, and is thankfully not electric. The Birdie Glow will initially be available in Electric Rose but will soon be available in other colors like Sky Blue, Twilight and Jet Pack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

		Katina Stefanova is CIO and CEO of <a href="https://www.martocapital.com/">Marto Capital</a>, a multistrategy asset manager based in New York that creates customizable investment solutions for institutional clients. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">If investors complained about Wall Street 80 years ago, they’re howling now. Industry players get richer and richer, while many investors see mediocre results after fees.</p>
<p>Asset management is a highly unusual and somewhat baffling industry. Here are six main examples of just how peculiar this industry is.</p>
<h2>The asset management industry rarely delivers what it promises: Alpha</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ray-dalio-youaposre-not-going-to-produce-alpha-so-focus-on-balancing8230and-meditation-1384273971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha is a zero-sum game</a>, according to Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio. By contrast, most industries are positive-sum: If you eat a great steak dinner, it doesn’t imply that others have to eat hot dogs. In asset management, each new money manager who generates alpha (returns above the passive benchmark performance) does so at the expense of other managers who underperform.</p>
<p>Your own investment’s value may change because of a change in the value of the underlying asset and/or market preferences. However, few investors can directly impact the value of the underlying asset, except for private equity and venture capital investors with portfolio acceleration strategies. Celebrity investors like George Soros can influence market preferences, but most of us don’t have that advantage.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Diversity and inclusion are the most readily solvable issues, and the inevitable aging of the &#8220;pale, male and stale&#8221; leaders of the industry will create room for new entrants.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In fact, it is mathematically impossible for the mean investor in a given sector to beat a low-cost index of that sector after expenses. We’d argue that money managers playing a positive-sum game include those who focus on well-developed sectors for which indices are not readily available (e.g., private companies, frontier markets, cryptocurrencies) and/or nascent asset classes.</p>
<p>For example, hedge funds, on average, have underperformed on a net-of-fees basis in both U.S. equities and bonds since 2000. The HFRI Index returned <a href="https://nirkaissar.com/hedge-funds-have-a-performance-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18.3%</a> annually during its initial 10 years from 1990 to 1999, but it returned just 3.4% annually over the 10 years to 2016. Similarly, according to <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/content/dam/marketing/shared/pdfs/Research/Active_Passive_Barometer_2020_02_.pdf?utm_source=eloqua&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=21040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morningstar’s Active/Passive Barometer</a>, in the five years ended October 2021, only 26.4% of U.S. large cap, 22.7% of U.S. small cap and 24.3% of global large-cap active equity mutual funds outperformed their passive competitors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2243256" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2243256" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2243256 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png" alt="Rolling ten-year returns have steadily declined across hedge fund strategies" width="1024" height="540" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png 1253w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png?resize=768,405 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image3.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2243256" class="wp-caption-text">Rolling 10-year returns have steadily declined across hedge fund strategies. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> David Teten<br />Blue bar: Hedge-Fund Research Institute (HFRI) Weighted Composite Index (HFRI FWD) Aug. 2018 | (HF Annual Return %).<br />Green bar: S&amp;P 500 Return (Bloomberg).<br />Blue line: Barclays Hedge AUM Hedge-Fund Industry; 2017 | (Hedge Fund Industry AUM $TN).</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Given better analytics, institutional investors have realized that there is little alpha and much of the excess returns are explained by risk premia,” Nicolas Rabener, managing director of FactorResearch, said.</p>
<p>Amit Matta, a risk management expert, observed that performance is often overstated (and risk understated) due to the illiquid nature of some of the underlying investments, which allows room to manipulate pricing in favorable ways.</p>
<p>However, a large group has different objectives — corporate players. &#8220;They are fully 50% of the primary market (sellers) and are material players in the secondary market (M&amp;A), which cumulatively makes the markets a positive-sum game. It&#8217;s possible for all asset managers to make money when they buy a successful IPO or sell their holding to a corporate buyer.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Size often hurts returns</h2>
<p>Standard compensation models motivate money managers to add more assets under management. This contributes to the &#8220;winner takes all&#8221; trend, where we see a steadily growing concentration of AUM at the largest money managers. The argument is that large hedge funds have the resources and talent to beat markets. The reality is far from that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More capital </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/lee-sec-speaks-2021-10-12#_ftn1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the private markets than the public markets for over a decade, and this staggering growth has shown no signs of slowing. As private investment booms, companies are developing new tools to help investors navigate these markets, which can be opaque and inconsistent when it comes to reporting performance data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based <a href="https://archlabs.com/">Arch</a> has entered the fray with $5.5 million in fresh seed funding for its aggregated private investment management platform, the company announced on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244265" style="width: 1232px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244265" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244265 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png" alt="Arch's task and tax management functions" width="1222" height="727" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png 2988w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=768,457 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=1536,914 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=2048,1219 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Task-and-Tax-Management-View.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244265" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Arch&#8217;s task and tax management functions <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arch</em></p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244256" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arch likens itself to investment management platform Fidelity, but for private investments. It automates “everything that isn’t advice” for investors, advisors, and accountants, co-founder and CEO Ryan Eisenman told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eisenman, who worked for an investment advisor while in college, started building Arch in early 2018 alongside his co-founders Jason Trigg and Joel Stein, both MIT-educated software engineers. They set out to aggregate information on one platform from various private investment managers, many of whom tend to have their own internally-built portals to manage data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We aggregate data from over 5000 different firms, and we can really manage any firm. We have a process that&#8217;s scalable – whether we&#8217;ve connected with them in the past, or if they&#8217;re a new firm, we can connect with them,” Eisenman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arch plans to use the proceeds from the seed round to hire new talent in operations, partnerships, and engineering, with the expectation of doubling its ten-person headcount by the end of next year, Eisenman said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new hires will help support its goal of expanding its platform to support a wider base of institutional investor types, including foundations, endowments, and pension funds. It has just over 100 clients today, most of which are investment advisors and family offices, Eisenman said. Arch does not have any full-time salespeople yet, which it hopes to add with this new capital, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For new firms sharing data with Arch, the onboarding process is low-touch, as the firms share the same information with Arch as they do with their clients, Eisenman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arch’s clients, the investors, report spending 35% less time on average managing their investments because of the efficiencies the platform provides by displaying information like company updates, tax information, capital calls, and cash flows all in one place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a ton of things that investors no longer need to do [with Arch]. They no longer need to log into a portal, pull down a document, file the document, make sense of it, pull data from the document, potentially put data into systems – all of that is fully automated for them,” Eisenman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Instead of getting tens, or sometimes hundreds, of emails, they get one email every day that summarizes all the actions they need to take and all the other information that&#8217;s come in, and then gives them direct links to that information into the documents themselves,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244268" style="width: 1232px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244268" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244268" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?w=300" alt="Arch's consolidated invest" width="1222" height="549" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png 3914w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=1536,691 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=2048,921 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Consolidated-Investment-Portal-Picture.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244268" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Arch&#8217;s consolidated investment portal <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arch</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arch also links to wealth management platform Addepar through its transactions API, as well as other popular databases including APX and Black Diamond, allowing Arch’s clients to integrate their performance reporting across the various platforms they use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch in June 2020, it has grown annualized recurring revenue (ARR) by over 1,100% and expanded its assets under management over 2,300% to $8 billion, the company says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.craftventures.com/">Craft Ventures</a> led the seed round alongside several prominent angels, including Warby Parker co-founders Neil Blumenthal and Dave Gilboa, Carta CEO and co-founder Henry Ward, Harry’s founder Jeff Raider, Allbirds founder Joey Zwillinger, and Doordash founder Tony Xu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Over 25 current Arch clients also participated because they understood the need for Arch&#8217;s software firsthand, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ability to also include people that have supported us early as clients, as investors in our last round, was something that we&#8217;re extremely proud of. We love creating situations where we can all be aligned and win together,” Eisenman said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit is launching a new personalized Spotify Wrapped-like recap feature for all users tomorrow. The new recaps will include a variety of stats, including a summary of the time you spent on the platform, a look at the content that you interacted with or contributed, topics you engaged with and communities you’ve viewed or joined. Reddit notes that users will be able to hide their username and avatar if they want when sharing the recap across other social media apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;In previous years, Reddit Recap focused on aggregated trends across the platform. This year we wanted to add a fun, personalized in-product experience to remind users of their contributions and belonging on the platform,&#8221; Reddit said in a statement. &#8220;Every Redditor has a unique role to play on Reddit, and so we referenced user browsing and engagement data from January 1st, 2021 to November 30th, 2021 to help shape the stories about how they fit in.&#8221;</p>
<p>End-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular thanks to Spotify&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/spotifys-wrapped-2021-arrives-with-artist-video-messages-blend-and-even-a-game/"> annual Wrapped</a> feature that is widely shared across social media each year. Given its success, it&#8217;s no surprise that other companies like Apple, YouTube, Snapchat and now Reddit are looking to mimic the popular feature with their own versions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244337" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to the launch of recaps, Reddit has released data about the most popular themes on the platform in 2021. The company notes that cryptocurrency, gaming, sports, weddings, health and fitness, food and drink, and movies and television were the most popular categories. In terms of cryptocurrency, the top five most-viewed crypto communities this year were r/dogecoin, r/superstonk. r/cryptocurrency, r/amcstock and r/bitcoin. So far this year, Reddit has seen 6.6 million mentions of &#8220;crypto&#8221; across its platform.</p>
<p>As for gaming, the top five most viewed communities in 2021 were r/genshinimpact, r/leagueoflegends, r/gaming, r/rpclipsgta and r/ffxiv. For the sports category, the top five communities were r/nba, r/soccer, r/nfl, r/squaredcircle and r/mma. In terms of the weddings category, the top five communities were r/weddingplanning, r/engagementrings, r/bridezillas, r/wedding and r/weddingsunder10k.</p>
<p>Regarding health and fitness, the top five communities were r/lifeprotips, r/sports, r/progresspics, r/fitness and r/loseit. As for the food and drink category, the top five were r/food, r/cooking, r/keto, r/kitchenconfidential and r/starbucks. Lastly, the top five communities in the movies and television category were r/movies, r/marvelstudios, r/starwars, r/moviedetails and r/dc_cinematic.</p>
<p>Reddit also revealed that users created 366 million posts in 2021, which is a 19% year-over-year increase. The company has seen 2.3 billion total comments, a 12 percent increase year-over-year and 46 billion total upvotes, a 1% increase year-over-year so far this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2009, <a href="https://intellihot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intellihot</a> has been on a mission to make commercial buildings more efficient, by improving the cost and physical footprint of keeping building H<sub>2</sub>O nice and toasty. The company just announced it raised $50 million to shake up the $81 billionn global HVAC market, with plans to expand internationally. The round was led by <span style="font-weight: 400;">investors </span><a href="https://www.aegonam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegon Asset Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.avenuecapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avenue Sustainable Solutions Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>When you walk into an office building, you see security guards, fancy company plaques on the walls and, around this time of year, you may see a Christmas tree or two. What you don&#8217;t see is what happens deep in the bowels of a building, and if you&#8217;ve never paused to think about the vast amount of magic that happens under the floors, in the walls and along the ceilings of a building, you&#8217;ve probably not thought about what an incredibly complex creature a modern office building can be. Apart from the immediately obvious &#8212; electricity, internet and an endless and deeply necessary supply of caffeinated hot beverages &#8212; buildings need hot water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paradoxically, hot water access is everywhere, necessary and yet easy to overlook — until you don’t have it anymore. Intellihot has recognized the enormous opportunity at hand to integrate hardware and software into a smart, environmentally sustainable solution to improve how commercial facilities use hot water,&#8221; said John Larkin, head of Impact Investments and co-manager of the Avenue Sustainable Solutions Fund. &#8220;Intellihot reflects well upon our strategy to partner with great businesses that can deliver financial performance along with beneficial outcomes for society and planet.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243610" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Larkin points out, if the hot water stops flowing, things very quickly get unpleasant. The challenge with hot water is that usage is incredibly time-specific. If the building has apartments or gyms in it, 7 am is a huge peak, and if the hot water runs out, the building managers&#8217; phones won&#8217;t stop ringing. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s also painfully expensive to heat water and to keep it hot, especially at times where hot water usage is lower than usual. Intellihot is addressing all of the above, using tankless, on-demand water heating solutions for a wide range of commercial buildings, including hotels, restaurants, stadiums, hospitals and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, truly we started it as outsiders, with no connection to the industry. I am passionate about energy loss; every time I see the radiator or a tailpipe on a car, I know that its singular purpose is to heat the environment,&#8221; explains Sridhar Deivasigamani, founder and CEO of Intellihot. &#8220;I felt the same thing when a water heater broke at my house. And since then, we have totally reinvented how water is heated and delivered.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a lot of applications, having a large tank of water means that hot water is instantly available while more water is being heated up. That&#8217;s convenient and serves as a buffer, but it is also spectacularly expensive to keep a large tank of water at temperature. In residential homes, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/water-heaters/tankless-water-heaters-vs-storage-tank-water-heaters-a5291982593/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Reports is seeing an increase</a> in the popularity of tankless, on-demand water heaters, but for commercial buildings, the adaptation has significantly lagged behind. One of the biggest challenges in this space is that a lot of planning and engineering goes into building and upgrading medium to large commercial buildings. When the buildings are designed, the space allocated to hot water is typically designed for water tanks &#8212; which have an 80% larger footprint than Intellihot&#8217;s heaters. Once the space is there, and the energy cost of heating the water is calculated into the overall energy expenditure of the building, there hasn&#8217;t traditionally been much incentive to switch to a tankless solution &#8212; but that is very slowly starting to shift.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the first new startup in this space in almost 100 years,&#8221; claims Deivasigamani. &#8220;If you look at the big three companies in this space, they all started in the late 1800s. So you have generations and generations of builders, building engineers and contractors thinking this is the only way it can be done.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, the incumbents are also starting to produce tankless heaters, but Intellihot believes it has an edge in the approach it takes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Equipment always breaks down on a Friday night, and 90% of equipment is replaced when there is an emergency. That&#8217;s not ideal. If you&#8217;re a Chipotle or Starbucks, the solution today is to double up the number of equipment they have. That&#8217;s not great for the environment. We have an alternate approach: we launched a piece of equipment that is called <a href="https://intellihot.com/products-commercial-tankless-hot-water-heater-type-gas/tellibot-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tellibot AI</a>,&#8221; explains Deivasigamani. The equipment connects to water heaters to gather data based on flow, heating patterns, etc. You install it for 10 days, and the company will analyze the data and give you a projection for how long the existing equipment will continue to perform. The goal is to give building owners a chance to replace water heaters as scheduled maintenance, rather than at the worst possible time, at exorbitant 24-hour-call-out rates.</p>
<p>Intellihot has its equipment installed &#8220;in thousands of buildings,&#8221; its CEO told me, including hotels, multi-family residential buildings, senior living facilities, hospitals and more. The company claims it has logged more than 670 million hours of operation without failures.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The aggregator model has proved to be very successful in Latin America as the e-commerce market explodes in the region.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new company is entering the crowded e-commerce aggregator space to acquire and scale high-performing Latin American brands selling on MercadoLibre, Shopify or Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://quinio.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quinio</a>, a Mexico-based company, announced today it secured $20 million in a debt-and-equity round that will be used to add more than 30 brands to its portfolio.</p>
<p>The company was founded last year by Juan Gavito, Iker Garay and Gavito’s brother, Santiago Gavito. CEO Juan Gavito, who was previously in digital advertising, and Santiago Gavito have backgrounds in private equity and venture capital, while Garay was scaling startups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244369" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Iker introduced us to Thrasio’s business model and we got excited,” Juan Gavito told TechCrunch. “We thought this is the way to capture value, so we started working on everything from creating the pipeline, team, tools and understanding the specifics of doing the acquisition.”</p>
<p>Quinio isn’t focused on any certain categories, but is going after medium-sized brands that bring in between $100,000 and $20 million in annual revenue. After acquisition, the Quinio team focuses on increasing sales, operations efficiency and optimizing cost structures.</p>
<p>The company will kick off the new year with 10 brands representing $10 million revenue run rate. That has enabled Quinio to realize double-digit growth each month so far. And although the company is initially looking at acquiring 30 brands, Gavito estimates there are 100,000 sellers across Latin America that fit its strategy among a market worth $105 billion.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by Cometa, which was joined by AlleyCorp, DILA Capital, Western Technology Investment, GBM Ventures, Bridge Partners and a group of entrepreneurs, including Adalberto Flores, founder and CEO of Kueski.</p>
<p>Juan Gavito expects to use over 80% of the new capital on acquiring companies, with a plan of three per month. The company will also expand its staff — at 33 people today — to over 100 by the end of next year as it begins looking for brands outside of Mexico in Chile, Colombia, Brazil and Argentina.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the new funding, Quinio joins a long list of aggregators, also known as e-commerce roll-ups, around the world that have also attracted investor attention to purchase marketplace companies.</p>
<p>For example, Beijing-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/chinese-amazon-aggregator-nebula-brands-raises-50m-led-by-l-catterton/">Nebula Brands took in $50 million</a> this week. Before them was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/gravitiq-throws-its-hat-into-crowded-e-commerce-aggregator-ring/">Gravitiq</a>, focused on healthcare brands, and Heyday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/heyday-raises-555m-to-buy-up-and-scale-more-d2c-brands-on-the-amazon-marketplace-universe/">$555 million Series C</a>. The big name in aggregators, Thrasio, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">$1 billion in October</a>, while Perch grabbed a large investment of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$775 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>Juan Gavito says the e-commerce aggregator model has proved to be very successful in Latin America, with a few initial players launching operations between January and August of this year, all in Mexico.</p>
<p>He notes this is due to the region being one of the fastest growing e-commerce markets in the world, citing a gross merchandise value growth of over 60% in 2020, to $105 billion, which represents double the growth rate initially expected before the global pandemic hit. E-commerce is expected to grow another 30% this year, Juan Gavito said.</p>
<p>One of the ways Quinio is differentiating itself is by acquiring companies with locally sourced products, with plans to have more than 60% of its portfolio this way.</p>
<p>“This is a key differential in terms of lead times and working capital requirements, especially considering the problems that the current Asia supply chain is facing,” Juan Gavito said. “There are just a few players in such a large market, so there is opportunity for all of us to have successful companies and business models. For example, in the U.S., there are more than 20, and many are successful.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce roll-up play <a href="https://www.opontia.com/">Opontia</a> launched in June, raising $20 million in debt and equity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> older, small e-commerce brands in the Middle East and Africa. Today, the company confirmed to TechCrunch that it has closed a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round, a $42 million Series A nine months after it was founded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roll-up plays are generally known to secure more debt than equity when they raise mega-round deals. Opontia&#8217;s seed round was the case, but the share between equity and venture debt stands at about 50% each for its Series A financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">STV led the round, with Raed Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Upper90 and VentureSouq participating</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Angel investors Salman Butt of Salla and Wiktor Namysl of McKinsey Poland joined, as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based venture debt fund Partners for Growth funded Opontia&#8217;s debt financing.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243468" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch gathered that Opontia has somewhat switched focus on its target market. Though it launched with eyes on the Middle East and Africa, the company has only made efforts in some parts of the former (the UAE and Saudi Arabia) while making significant headway into Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Turkey and Poland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is opportunity there; it&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not the biggest markets,&#8221; co-founder and co-CEO</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnstonphilip/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Johnston</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said when asked why Opontia wasn&#8217;t in Africa yet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Poland is six times the size of Egypt, for example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> e-commerce spend. We&#8217;re definitely going to Africa; we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are doing the biggest markets first. So if you have to prioritize, you go for the market that&#8217;s the biggest and then you work your way down. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the biggest markets for us, it&#8217;s Poland, Turkey, Saudi, UAE, Nigeria, after that is Egypt and Pakistan.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia has a slight operational and geographical difference, though. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Opontia founders, while Thrasio, Berlin Brands, Branded </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Western Europe, Opontia has found an opening in targeting brands in East and Central Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, none of these players except Opontia is active in the Middle East. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unlike the more prominent players, Opontia pursues an omnichannel model instead of a singular model targeting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;FBA&#8221; &#8212; fullfillment by Amazon &#8212; businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when one of our unique values is we are building like a house of brands on our omnichannel setup. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So compared to Thrasio, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focusing on FBA, we focus on three different sales channels &#8212; marketplaces, website, Shopify and social commerce,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; co-founder and co-CEO</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manfredmeyer82/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Manfred Meyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So our acquisitions are now like 50% marketplace, but 50% marketplace and Shopify. What we&#8217;re doing is like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like building a setup where you can serve all the customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not only on the Amazon marketplace.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the founders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/opontia-raises-20m-to-roll-up-e-commerce-brands-in-africa-and-the-middle-east/">spoke to TechCrunch</a> in June, they mentioned that Opontia was in talks with &#8220;more than 100 small e-commerce brands&#8221; and claimed to have signed several term sheets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, it has purchased four brands, including Novimed, a UAE-based direct-to-consumer outfit that sells medical equipment and therapeutic products.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And since acquiring Novimed in August, Opontia said it has quadrupled the brand&#8217;s revenues and doubled its profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Opontia exists because we realized that there are many e-commerce entrepreneurs in CEEMEA who have grown their brands to a certain point but now need help to take it to the next level,&#8221; the founders said in an email response on why brands see getting acquired by Opontia as a viable option</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We give the founder an attractive exit, while also giving them a share in the future growth in the profit of the brand as we scale them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it wants to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 20 more brands across Eastern and Central Europe and the Middle East in six months. J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ohnston said at least two-thirds of the Series A investment, about $30 million, will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to carry out these acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opontia has also hired a former executive at Jumia Kenya as its VP of operations, who will be responsible for the company&#8217;s efforts in Africa as it hopes to establish offices in Egypt and Nigeria, in addition to those in Istanbul, Warsaw, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.</span></p>
