										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The General Services Administration has denied a senator&#8217;s request to review documents Zoom submitted to have its software approved for use in the federal government.</p>
<p>The denial was in response <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wyden-zoom-gsa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a letter</a> sent by Democratic senator Ron Wyden to the GSA in May, expressing concern that the agency cleared Zoom for use by federal agencies just weeks before a major security vulnerability was discovered in the app.</p>
<p>Wyden said the discovery of the bug raises &#8220;serious questions about the quality of FedRAMP’s audits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoom was approved to operate in government in April 2019 after receiving its FedRAMP authorization, a program operated by the GSA that ensures cloud services comply with a standardized set of security requirements designed to toughen the service from some of the most common threats. Without this authorization, federal agencies cannot use cloud products or technologies that are not cleared.</p>
<p>Months later, Zoom was forced to patch its Mac app after a security researcher found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/a-vulnerability-in-zooms-mac-client-could-allow-websites-to-turn-on-cameras-without-permission/">a flaw</a> that could be abused to remotely switch on a user&#8217;s webcam without their permission. Apple was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/">forced to intervene</a> since users were still affected by the vulnerabilities even after uninstalling Zoom. As the pandemic spread and lockdowns were enforced, Zoom&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/zooms-paid-usage-skyrockets-as-remote-work-takes-over/">popularity skyrocketed</a> — as did the scrutiny — including a technical analysis by reporters that found Zoom <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">was not truly end-to-end encrypted</a> as the company long claimed.</p>
<p>Wyden wrote to the GSA to say he found it &#8220;extremely concerning&#8221; that the security bugs were discovered after Zoom’s clearance. In the letter, the senator requested the documents known as the &#8220;security package,&#8221; which Zoom submitted as part of the FedRAMP authorization process, to understand how and why the app was cleared by GSA.</p>
<p>The GSA declined Wyden&#8217;s first request in July 2020 on the grounds that he was not a committee chair. In the new Biden administration, Wyden was named chair of the Senate Finance Committee and requested Zoom&#8217;s security package again.</p>
<p>But in a new letter sent to Wyden&#8217;s office late last month, GSA declined the request for the second time, citing security concerns.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;GSA&#8217;s refusal to share the Zoom audit with Congress calls into question the security of the other software products that GSA has approved for federal use.&#8221; <cite>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR)</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>&#8220;The security package you have requested contains highly sensitive proprietary and other confidential information relating to the security associated with the Zoom for Government product. Safeguarding this information is critical to maintaining the integrity of the offering and any government data it hosts,&#8221; said the GSA letter. &#8220;Based on our review, GSA believes that disclosure of the Zoom security package would create significant security risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to the GSA&#8217;s letter, Wyden told TechCrunch that he was concerned that other flawed software may have been approved for use across the government.</p>
<p>“The intent of GSA&#8217;s FedRAMP program is good — to eliminate red tape so that multiple federal agencies don’t have to review the security of the same software. But it’s vitally important that whichever agency conducts the review do so thoroughly,&#8221; said Wyden. &#8220;I’m concerned that the government’s audit of Zoom missed serious cybersecurity flaws that were subsequently uncovered and exposed by security researchers. GSA’s refusal to share the Zoom audit with Congress calls into question the security of the other software products that GSA has approved for federal use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the people we spoke with who have first-hand knowledge of the FedRAMP process, either as a government employee or as a company going through the certification, FedRAMP was described as a comprehensive but by no means an exhaustive list of checks that companies have to meet in order to meet the security requirements of the federal government.</p>
<p>Others said that the process had its limits and would benefit from reform. One person with knowledge of how FedRAMP works said the process was not a complete audit of a product&#8217;s source code but akin to a checklist of best practices and meeting compliance requirements. Much of it relies on trusting the vendor, said the person, describing it like &#8221; an honor system.&#8221; Another person said the FedRAMP process cannot catch every bug, as evidenced by executive action taken by President Biden this week aimed at <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">modernizing and improving the FedRAMP process</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the people we spoke to weren&#8217;t surprised that Wyden&#8217;s office was denied the request, citing the sensitivity of a company&#8217;s FedRAMP security package.</p>
<p>The people said that companies going through the certification process have to provide highly technical details about the security of their product, which if exposed would almost certainly be damaging to the company. Knowing where security weaknesses might be could tip off cyber-criminals, one of the people said. Companies often spend millions on improving their security ahead of a FedRAMP audit but companies wouldn&#8217;t risk going through the certification if they thought their trade secrets would get leaked, they added.</p>
<p>When asked by GSA why it objected to Wyden&#8217;s request, Zoom&#8217;s head of U.S. government relations Lauren Belive argued that handing over the security package &#8220;would set a dangerous precedent that would undermine the special trust and confidence&#8221; that companies place in the FedRAMP process.</p>
<p>GSA puts strict controls on who can access a FedRAMP security package. You need a federal government or military email address, which the senator&#8217;s office has. But the reason for GSA denying Wyden&#8217;s request still isn&#8217;t clear, and when reached a GSA spokesperson would not explain how a member of Congress would obtain a company&#8217;s FedRAMP security package</p>
<p>&#8220;GSA values its relationship with Congress and will continue to work with Senator Wyden and our committees of jurisdiction to provide appropriate information regarding our programs and operations,&#8221; said GSA spokesperson Christina Wilkes, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;GSA works closely with private sector partners to provide a standardized approach to security authorizations for cloud services through the [FedRAMP]. Zoom’s FedRAMP security package and related documents provide detailed information regarding the security measures associated with the Zoom for Government product. GSA’s consistent practice with regard to sensitive security and trade secret information is to withhold the material absent an official written request of a congressional committee with jurisdiction, and pursuant to controls on further dissemination or publication of the information.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>GSA wouldn&#8217;t say which congressional committee had jurisdiction or whether Wyden&#8217;s role as chair of the Senate Finance Committee suffices, nor would the agency answer questions about the efficacy of the FedRAMP process raised by Wyden.</p>
<p>Zoom spokesperson Kelsey Knight said that cloud companies like Zoom &#8220;provide proprietary and confidential information to GSA as part of the FedRAMP authorization process with the understanding that it will be used only for their use in making authorization decisions. While we do not believe Zoom’s FedRAMP security package should be disclosed outside of this narrow purpose, we welcome conversations with lawmakers and other stakeholders about the security of Zoom for Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoom said it has &#8220;engaged in security enhancements to continually improve its products,&#8221; and received FedRAMP reauthorization in 2020 and 2021 as part of its annual renewal. The company declined to say to what extent the Zoom app was audited as part of the FedRAMP process.</p>
<p>Over two dozen federal agencies use Zoom, including the Defense Department, Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Executive Office of the President.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More details are beginning to emerge on Houston-based Axiom Space’s ambitious project to build and operate the world’s first commercial space station.</p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space, a European aerospace manufacturer, will develop the two pressurized modules of the Axiom Space Station. The two elements, which are scheduled to launch in 2024 and 2025, will dock to the International Space Station before eventually detaching and operating as fully independent, commercial station.</p>
<p>The two companies announced the signing of the final contract, valued at €110 million ($130 million), on Thursday. Each module will be able to accommodate four people. Thales will also be designing the micrometeoroid and debris protection system for each module.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The modules are still in their design phase, Thales Alenia said. The company recently completed development of the first module’s four radial bulkheads at its facility in Turin, Italy. The bulkheads, once connected, will form a cylinder. That structure will attach to the common berth mechanisms, parts of the module that will can connect to the ISS, and hatches.</p>

<p>The two modules have a long road ahead of them. Thales Alenia, a joint venture between French company Thales Group and Italian conglomerate Leonardo, will begin welding on the first module this September through to next year. That module will be sent to Axiom’s Texas facilities in July 2023, where Axiom will then integrate the core systems and prepare it for launch in 2024.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/nasa-taps-startup-axiom-space-for-the-first-habitable-commercial-module-for-the-space-station/">tapped Axiom</a> to build the first commercial living quarters for the ISS in January 2020. Once the ISS is decommissioned, Axiom’s station will detach and function as a commercial center for future missions and scientific experiments. It’s a major part of NASA’s plans to encourage the growth of the burgeoning low Earth orbit economy and the buildout of other private orbital labs and commercial facilities.</p>
<p>Axiom will also operate the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/axiom-space-and-nasa-detail-first-fully-private-human-launch-to-the-space-station-set-for-january-2022/">first fully private</a> mission to the ISS, scheduled for January 2022. Axiom Mission 1 will send four private astronauts to space onboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon, for an eight-day mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM and its new EV business unit BrightDrop are launching a fleet charging service as the automaker aims to ramp up its bet on connected and electric commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>The service, branded Ultium Charge 360 fleet charging service in a nod to GM&#8217;s new electric architecture and batteries that will be the foundation of its future EV plans, offers many of the tools that a commercial delivery, sales or motor pool business might need. It also includes an effort to add home charging for drivers.</p>
<p>The charging service is the latest addition to BrightDrop, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">launched in January</a>. The business unit offers commercial customers — starting with FedEx — an ecosystem of electric and connected products. BrightDrop has said it will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimate range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1. BrightDrop is part of GM&#8217;s aim to reach 1 million EV sales globally by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM and BrightDrop are launching the charging service with Duke Energy company eTransEnergy, EVgo, In-Charge Energy and Schneider Electric, four companies that can provide the infrastructure needed to keep the commercial vans properly powered.</p>
<p>On the home-charging front, GM said it will expand an existing agreement with Qmerit.</p>

<p>The service is meant to provide tools for fleet operators, which Alex Keros, GM&#8217;s  lead architect of EV Infrastructure noted in a call with reporters Thursday are important market growth segment and a critical piece of the electrification puzzle. The company looked at &#8220;how to put the right customer experiences together &#8230; you know, when you think about fleets these are cars that come home with employees for example, and we&#8217;ll have to help those companies and employees figure out charging in their home.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's not super stupid to value Revolut far more richly with massively improved gross margins, profitability and more proven revenue growth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News broke this morning that Revolut, a U.K.-based consumer fintech player, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/">raised a Series E round of funding worth $800 million</a> at a valuation of $33 billion. Those figures are breathtaking not only due to their sheer scale, but also thanks to their radical divergence from Revolut&#8217;s preceding funding event.</p>

<p>As TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/ingridlunden">Ingrid Lunden</a> wrote earlier today concerning the news:</p>
<blockquote><p>This latest Series E is being co-led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global, who appear to be the only backers in this round. It comes on the heels of <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/klarna-effect-propels-digital-bank-revolut-to-30bn-valuation-in-softbank-talks-12347766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors earlier this month</a> Revolut was raising big. Revolut last raised about a year ago, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/revolut-extends-series-d-round-to-580-million-with-80-million-in-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed out a Series D at $580 million</a>, but what is stunning is how much its valuation has changed since then, growing 6x (it was $5.5 billion last year).</p></blockquote>
<p>Stunning indeed.</p>
<p>Lunden also went on to report on the company&#8217;s changing financial picture based on Revolut&#8217;s recently released 2020 results. In this entry, we&#8217;re digging more deeply into those financial results and usage metrics detailed by the fintech megacorn.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Shortly after the first  <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626363395439000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnejcRsz6jYLrLkHznqKjW4-FB2Q">Sight Tech Global</a> event, in December last year, Apple and Microsoft announced remarkable new features for mobile phones. Anyone could point the phone camera at a scene and request a “scene description.” In a flash, a cloud-based, computer vision AI determined what was in the scene and a machine-voice read the information. Learning that “a room contains three chairs and a table” might not seem like a big advance for the sighted, but for blind or visually impaired people, the new feature was a notable milestone for accessibility technology: An affordable, portable and nearly universal device could now “see” on behalf of just about anyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Technologies like scene description will be on the agenda at the second annual Sight Tech Global event, December 1-2, 2021. The free, sponsor-supported, virtual and global event will convene many of the world’s top technologists, researchers, advocates and founders to discuss how rapid advances in technology, many centered on AI, are altering &#8212; both improving and complicating &#8212; accessibility for people with sight loss.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform">Register</a> today &#8212; it’s free.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">At the heart of Sight Tech Global is the hard question: How do highly advanced, AI-based technologies actually become compelling, affordable products that folks who are blind or visually impaired readily adopt? It took 40 years, for example, for the $50,000 “Kurzweil reading machine,” a boxy desktop device, to evolve into what blind people take for granted today, a free app available on any mobile phone that can “read” just about any text. As anyone working in the field will tell you, shaping technologies into truly useful, everyday, affordable tools for people with vision loss is no less demanding than it was 40 years ago.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The overlapping in job roles is uncanny: The best investors and founders have to find focus through the noise, understand the weight of due diligence and pitch others with conviction.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event last week, <a href="https://www.nvp.com/">Norwest Venture Partners</a>&#8216; <a href="https://www.nvp.com/team/lisa-wu/">Lisa Wu</a> took the stage to discuss how founders can think like venture capitalists in all facets of their business. The overlapping in job roles is uncanny: The best investors and founders have to find focus through the noise, understand the weight of due diligence and pitch others with conviction. Wu, who has investments in Plaid, Calm and Ritual, used anecdotes and exercises &#8212; such as the eyebrow test &#8212; in the tactical, engaging chat.</p>
<h2>Pitch deck or pitch blurb?</h2>
<p>Startup founders often turn to pitch decks when fundraising as a visual representation of their story &#8212; from the origins to total addressable market to those juicy metrics. While the format definitely works, the influx of pitch decks in a hot deal environment makes it harder to stand out.</p>
<p>Wu gave some pointers on how she reacts to cold pitch decks, and why founders may want to take some unconventional advice.</p>
<blockquote><p>I love it because I can quickly flip through the deck and generally form an opinion on it. And I think I&#8217;ve read some stat recently, which is that investors really spend 2 minutes and 47 seconds per deck. It&#8217;s an easy way for me to, in that short amount of time, just get a calibration of the business to decide whether to move forward.</p>
<p>But, as the founder, I&#8217;ll probably tell you don&#8217;t do [the cold pitch deck]. Because if you&#8217;re sending me the pitch deck, I&#8217;m quickly screening and then I&#8217;m making a decision of whether it makes sense to meet, but your goal is really just to try to get the meeting with me to tell the story and let that unfold. And so, give us enough of it &#8212; like a blurb to tease us to want to continue to engage is great. But if it is possible, I would suggest a late pullback of the pitch deck, even though I love to receive it in advance.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 21:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, she loves founders sliding into the DMs with pitch decks, but doesn&#8217;t think that strategy always gives the founder storytelling power.</p>
<p>This answer triggered a series of questions from attendees on whether pitch decks are even necessary in the first place. Here, Wu explains how the competitive venture market has impacted her preferences &#8212; and her interest in what I&#8217;d describe it as a private beta, except for fundraising rounds.</p>
<blockquote><p>So, everything is shifting these days. Because there&#8217;s so much capital [and competition] out there, sometimes if I&#8217;m chasing a really hot company, I actually prefer that they don&#8217;t have a deck, or they haven&#8217;t created one yet. Because once you have a deck, that means you can go and take it out to a bunch of other investors, too. And so it&#8217;s helpful to structure the conversation and to storytell around it. I think I like a deck more so than not, unless it&#8217;s in a competitive situation. If I&#8217;m trying to close the deal, I actually prefer just an open dialogue.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 23:30)</strong></em></p>
<p>We just have them come in and we just prepare our team internally to let them know that there&#8217;s no deck here. And so, it&#8217;s just up to the founders to really just tell the story to us. And, it&#8217;s worked.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 24:20)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for more affordable housing has never been more urgent as a shortage in the U.S. housing market persists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups attempting to help address the shortage in a variety of ways abound. One such startup, </span><a href="http://www.abodu.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abodu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners. Previous backer Initialized Capital also participated in the financing, along with Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman, former Stockton, California Mayor Michael Tubbs, GGV investor Hans Tung and Paradox Capital’s Kyle Tibbitts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California legislature changed laws in 2017 to make it easier to build Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). Then on January 1, 2020, the state of California made it dramatically easier to add extra housing units to single-family home sites. Cities and local agencies have to quickly approve or deny ADU projects within 60 days of receiving a permit application. The state also now prevents cities from imposing minimum lot size requirements, maximum ADU dimensions or off-street parking requirements. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redwood City, California-based Abodu, which builds prefabricated ADUs, was founded in 2018 to serve as a “one-stop shop” for building an ADU, or as some describe it, a home in a backyard.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177462" style="width: 494px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177462" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2177462" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adobu_Portrait_Outdoor_4x3.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="484" height="363" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adobu_Portrait_Outdoor_4x3.jpg 2160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adobu_Portrait_Outdoor_4x3.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adobu_Portrait_Outdoor_4x3.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adobu_Portrait_Outdoor_4x3.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adobu_Portrait_Outdoor_4x3.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adobu_Portrait_Outdoor_4x3.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adobu_Portrait_Outdoor_4x3.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adobu_Portrait_Outdoor_4x3.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177462" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Co-founders John Geary and Eric McInerney / Abodu</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sets the company apart from others in the space, its execs claim, is that it not only builds and installs the units, it helps homeowners with the painful process of getting permits. <span class="il">Abodu</span> says it pre-approves its structural engineering with California state-level agencies to ensure its units can be built statewide and works with local agencies to pre-approve its foundation systems to ensure projects can proceed on predictable timelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also claims to offer a cheaper and faster process than if one were to build an ADU from start to finish. Specifically, the startup claims that one of its backyard homes can be installed in just 10% of the time it would take for a traditional ADU to be built. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abodu has been active in the market, selling and building its ADUs since the fall of 2019. Since then, it has put “dozens and dozens” of units in the ground, and has multiple dozen units in production on top of that, according to CEO and co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Geary. So far, it’s operating in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Seattle. The company claims it can deliver an ADU in as little as 30 days in San Jose and Los Angeles thanks to the cities’ pre-approval process. In other cities in California and Washington, turnaround is “as little as 12 weeks.” But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a standard bespoke project takes 4-5 months from start to finish, according to Geary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s three products include a 340-square foot studio; a 500-square foot one bedroom, one bath, and a 610-square foot two bedroom unit. All have kitchens and living space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing starts at $190,000, but the average project cost across all sizes is around $230,000, Geary said, inclusive of permits and site work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of use cases for ADUs, the most popular of which is to house family and for rental income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the pandemic, multigenerational living has been at an all-time high. There are acute family needs that people are trying to solve for,” Geary said. “In addition, folks are earning extra money by renting them out to members of the community such as teachers or fireman, a single person or younger couple.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, Abodu is eyeing the San Diego market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, we covered the recent raise of Mighty Buildings, another Bay Area-based startup building ADUs and other housing. The biggest difference between the two companies, according to Geary, is that Mighty Buildings is focused on innovation in construction with its 3D-printed method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We decided early on that we didn&#8217;t want to reinvent the wheel from the construction standpoint,” Geary said. “Instead, we looked at ‘how can we solve for speed and ease?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abodu operates with an asset-light model, and doesn’t own any factories. Instead, it has built a network of factory “partners” across the Western U.S. that builds its units depending on how their capacities look at any given time.</span></p>
<p>Naturally, the company&#8217;s investors are bullish on the company&#8217;s business model.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Crowe, managing partner of Norwest Venture Partners, believes that Abodu’s &#8220;beautifully crafted units&#8221; are just one of the company&#8217;s selling points. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;John, Eric, and their team manage the end-to-end process of permitting, building, and installing on behalf of their customers,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;And with the expedited permitting that Abodu has been granted in over two dozen cities, it has faster time-to-installation than other ADU market participants.  The result has been very high levels of customer satisfaction and rapid growth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Former Stockton Mayor Tubbs said Abodu is tacklin<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">g two of California’s most consequential issues: the statewide housing shortage and its impacts on racial and economic segregation in our neighborhoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;By making it fast and accessible for normal homeowners to build high-quality backyard housing units, Abodu’s success will mean integrating options for both renters and homeowners in the same neighborhoods, while supporting small landlords and property owners in building equity in their homes,&#8221; he wrote via email.</span></p>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Tubbs went on to describe the speed that Abodu can deliver housing units to customers in certain parts of California &#8220;astounding.&#8221; </span></div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Abodu’s team has done some of the most difficult legwork for property owners by building local contractor relationships with reliable, vetted, high-quality partners,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a homeowner myself, I know the challenges of permitting and finding contractors during construction. It’s this thoughtful attention to detail and customer trust that sets Abodu apart from other similar offerings.&#8221;</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alt-Bionics made waves back in late 2019 when the brand new startup competed at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) Tech Symposium. The company finished second to 3BM’s infrared paint-curing system, but Alt went on to capture national and international headlines on the strength of promising technology and a great story.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.utsa.edu/today/2019/11/story/tech-symposium-winner.html">A writeup on the school’s site</a> noted that, at $700, its prosthetic hand cost a mere fraction of the cost of standard systems. Most of the subsequent coverage has focused on the story of the team’s journey from good idea to marketable product, with CEO/co-founder (and USTA engineering grad) Ryan Saavedra noting that these sorts of products can range from $10,000-$150,000 a pop. The company is working to a price point around $3,500.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Alt-Bionics team has been chronicling product development on social media. Before we get this roundup stared in earnest, we wanted to check in with Saavedra about how the past three years have gone and what the future holds for the company. And bonus: We’ve got a couple of unreleased renderings that Alt notes are “not indicative of our final product. Just merely a celebratory rendering our team put together to announce the completion of our patent” &#8212; so take that as you will.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><strong>TechCrunch: Why are prosthetics prohibitively expensive?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start by saying that they aren&#8217;t expensive to manufacture and they do not need to be so expensive to the user. At all. There is no one answer for this, but I will do my best to summarize the multiple reasons behind the exorbitant prices surrounding bionic hands. We have found that there are two parts to the end price/cost of <span class="il">prosthetic</span> devices. A third (but secondary reason) will also be discussed.</p>
<p>The manufacturer. The manufacturer develops and creates these bionic devices and then sells them to <span class="il">prosthetic</span> and orthotic clinics (one of the few places you can be fitted for and purchase these devices). The most affordable bionic <span class="il">prosthetic</span> <u>hand</u> sold to P&amp;O clinics starts at about $10,000 and can go up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Oddly enough, this cost doesn&#8217;t always reflect the functionality or performance of the devices. These manufacturers ultimately determine the prices of their devices. The larger among them cite overhead costs as the primary reason they cannot lower their price tags.</p>
<p>The <span class="il">prosthetic</span> &amp; orthotic clinic. We are still learning more about the specifics, but these clinics handle the medical insurance side of things. This means that they submit LCodes (insurance codes for bionic hands, suggested by the manufacturer) to the medical insurance company for reimbursement. These LCodes have floor and ceiling reimbursement amounts that the prosthetist can select. The reimbursement amount is commonly more than what they paid for the hand, and covers the time and effort the clinic and clinician put into procurement, fitting, testing, assembly and patient care. While normally a reasonable margin is obtained (through reimbursement amounts closer to the floor), we have seen reimbursement amounts exceed $124,000 for a $10,000 hand (from a 2018 patient receipt).</p>
<p>Technological stagnation. The technology for bionic hands has been stagnant for almost 15 years, with companies only just now emerging as competitors in this space. Larger companies in this space are tackling more than the one area of transradial (below elbow) bionic <span class="il">prosthetic</span> devices. This means that their attention is not solely focused on the development and affordability aspects of upper extremity <span class="il">prostheses</span>. The stagnation has meant that there are no external factors or forces being pressed on the existing devices and their manufacturers. Essentially, they have no reason to lower the prices, so they remain the same. This is more of an affirmation that reason No. 1 is a larger problem.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: How has the reception been from the broader medical community?</strong></p>
<p>Wonderful! Clinics, clinicians, patients, potential users and other competing companies have all been incredibly supportive of our mission. The space and companies, while competitive, are all aiming for the same thing: using technological advancements to give people a better quality of life.</p>
<p>There is obviously some skepticism at first at how we are able to achieve our much lower price point ($3,500), but it is quickly assuaged when we talk with them about our technologies and processes. We are currently discussing partnerships with <span class="il">prosthetic</span> and orthotic clinics to help develop devices that not only help patients, but also lessen the burden of prosthetists in the repair and maintenance of these devices.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: How far along is the project? What’s the current timeline for bringing it to market?</strong></p>
<p>The project is just emerging from its infancy and is about 42% complete. Some notable achievements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successful proof of concept with Army Ranger, Ryan Davis. December, 2019.</li>
<li>Alt-Bionics was formed. May 2020.</li>
<li>$42,000 SolidWorks grant from D&#8217;Assault Systems. July, 2020.</li>
<li>Provisional patent filed. June, 2021.</li>
<li>$50,000 investment from the city of San Antonio&#8217;s SAMMI Fund. July 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current timeline to bring our device to market is one year from the closing of our seed round of financing. We have, to date, raised $142,000 of our $200,000 goal and are looking to close out this round by September.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: What have the biggest challenges been so far?</strong></p>
<p>Navigating the FDA regulatory space and raising capital. It is no secret that the FDA regulatory process is a fearsome beast. There are even companies dedicated to assisting those looking to bring medical devices to market, navigate the process and all its intricacies. Alt-Bionics was recently accepted into a biomedical accelerator program based out of San Antonio, Texas, and will be working with regulatory experts to ensure we have a smooth rest of the ride to market. While our mission is noble and our business plan sound, COVID has brought about many worries and fears from investors. The inability to pitch to a live audience has hindered us from being able to appear in front of investors and has made raising capital a little more difficult than it normally is for a company like ours.</p>
<p><b><strong>TechCrunch: </strong>What is your funding status? How much have you raised thus far and are you looking to raise more?</b></p>
<p>To date, Alt-Bionics has raised a total of $142,000 from a handful of investors and has received a $50,000 investment from the city of San Antonio&#8217;s SAMMI fund. We are looking for an additional $58,000 from accredited investors to help fill out our seed round. From there our timeline of one year to market begins (though we have a hefty head start) and Alt-Bionics will push into its Series A, which will allow us to bring on additional engineers, develop the technology further and expand into international markets.</p>
<p><b> <strong>TechCrunch: </strong>Are developing markets going to be a key target? </b></p>
<p>Developing countries will be a key market for Alt-Bionics, particularly through NGOs, and will play an important part in our international expansion. We see a large opportunity to provide our medical devices to these markets. Affordability is critical to our mission to provide access to these devices and therefore we believe we will be successful with this expansion.</p>

<p>I’ll cop to the fact that when Berkshire<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/07/12/2261170/0/en/Berkshire-Grey-Accelerates-With-New-Orders-And-Increased-Backlog.html"> Grey announced a “$23+” million deal</a> for grocery picking robots, I had one name in mind: Walmart. After talking a bit about Walmart’s mixed robotics play in this panel a couple of weeks back, I’d heard rumblings the company was getting set for a big new play in the category.</p>

<p>Granted, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/walmart-will-be-bringing-symbotic-robots-to-25-distribution-centers/">the Symbotic deal</a> doesn’t necessarily mean BG isn’t teaming with Walmart on this one, but it’s worth noting that the mega-retailer loves talking about its big spending on automation. From the outside, looking in, at least, it seems like these deals are often as much about the PR of looking like it’s ready to compete with Amazon as they are about actually competing with Amazon (win-win, I guess).</p>

<p>The deal will bring Symbotic’s tech to 25 additional Walmart distribution centers (the two have been running pilots since 2017) in a rollout that will take “several years,” per Walmart. I’ve speculated before (and will happily continue to do so) that one or several of these robotic fulfillment companies are a no-brainer acquisition for Walmart, though Symbotic is probably a bit tougher, given existing ties with competitors like Target.</p>
<p>Berkshire Grey, meanwhile, continues to go the public route. Revolution Acceleration Acquisition Corp. (RAAC) shareholders are set to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/robotics-company-berkshire-grey-to-go-public-via-spac/"> vote on the SPAC deal on July 20</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/zebra-technologies-is-acquiring-warehouse-robotics-company-fetch/">Newly soon to be acquired Fetch</a>, meanwhile,<a href="https://fetchrobotics.com/fetch-robotics-blog/fetch-robotics-and-korber-announce-new-case-picking-solution-for-distribution-centers/"> announced a deal</a> with supply chain logistics company Korber for a new pallet robot designed to replace forklifts.</p>

<p>A pair of cool research projects this week. Devin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/stumble-proof-robot-adapts-to-challenging-terrain-in-real-time/">wrote about a team from Facebook AI, UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University</a> that is exploring Rapid Motor Adaptation, a method that allows quadrupedal robots to adapt to uneven terrain on the fly. This quote from one of the Berkley researchers gets to the heart of the matter: “We do not learn about sand, we learn about feet sinking.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Database technology can change the world, but the world in these parts changes very, very slowly. That’s made building a startup in the sector a tough equation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every application is a palimpsest of technologies, each layer forming a base that enables the next layer to function. Web front ends rely on JavaScript and browser DOM, which rely on back-end APIs, which themselves rely on databases.</p>
<p>As one goes deeper down the stack, engineering decisions become ever more conservative — changing the location of a button in a web app is an inconvenience; changing a database engine can radically upend an entire project.</p>
<p>It’s little surprise then that database technologies are among the longest-lasting engineering projects in the modern software developer toolkit. MySQL, which remains one of the most popular database engines in the world, was first released in the mid-1990s, and Oracle Database, launched more than four decades ago, is still widely used in high-performance corporate environments.</p>
<p>Database technology can change the world, but the world in these parts changes very, very slowly. That’s made building a startup in the sector a tough equation: Sales cycles can be painfully slow, even when new features can dramatically expand a developer’s capabilities. Competition is stiff and comes from some of the largest and most entrenched tech companies in the world. Exits have also been few and far between.</p>
<p>That challenge — and opportunity — is what makes studying Cockroach Labs so interesting. The company behind <b>CockroachDB</b> attempts to solve a long-standing problem in large-scale, distributed database architecture: How to make it so that data created in one place on the planet is <i>always</i> available for consumption by applications that are thousands of miles away, <i>immediately</i> and <i>accurately</i>. Making global data always available immediately and accurately might sound like a simple use case, but in reality it’s quite the herculean task. Cockroach Labs’ story is one of an uphill struggle, but one that saw it turn into a next-generation, $2-billion-valued database contender.</p>
<p>The lead writer of this EC-1 is <b>Bob Reselman</b>. Reselman has been writing about the enterprise software market for more than two decades, with a particular emphasis on teaching and educating engineers on technology. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, figures were designed by <strong>Bob Reselman</strong> and stylized by <strong>Bryce Durbin</strong>, and illustrations were drawn by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>CockroachDB had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Reselman has no financial ties to CockroachDB or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The CockroachDB EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 9,100 words and a reading time of 37 minutes. Here’s what we’ll be crawling over:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Part 1: Origin story</b> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">CockroachDB, the database that just won’t die</a>&#8221; (2,100 words/8 minutes) — Looks at the origins of CockroachDB, from the creation of the popular open-source image editor GIMP to some of Google&#8217;s most well-known infrastructure products.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Part 2: Technical design </strong>&#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">How engineers fought the CAP theorem in the global war on latency</a>&#8221; (2,400 words/10 minutes) — Analyzes the key differentiation that CockroachDB offers the relational database market, particularly its focus on geography and data storage.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Part 3: Developer relations and business</strong> &#8220;&#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-developers/">Developers, as you know, do not like to pay for things</a>&#8216;&#8221; (2,200 words/9 minutes) — Explores how CockroachDB engages with developers while also pivoting to the cloud at a key inflection point in its business.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There is an art to engineering, and sometimes engineering can transform art. For Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis, those two worlds collided when they created the widely successful open-source graphics program, GIMP, as college students at Berkeley.</p>
<p>That project was so successful that when the two joined Google in 2002, Sergey Brin and Larry Page personally stopped by to tell the new hires how much they liked it and explained how they used the program to create the first Google logo.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Cockroach Labs was started by developers and stays true to its roots to this day.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In terms of good fortune in the corporate hierarchy, when you get this type of recognition in a company such as Google, there’s only one way you can go — up. They went from rising stars to stars at Google, becoming the go-to guys on the Infrastructure Team. They could easily have looked forward to a lifetime of lucrative employment.</p>
<p>But Kimball, Mattis and another Google employee, Ben Darnell, wanted more — a company of their own. To realize their ambitions, they created Cockroach Labs, the business entity behind their ambitious open-source database CockroachDB. Can some of the smartest former engineers in Google’s arsenal upend the world of databases in a market spotted with the gravesites of storage dreams past? That’s what we are here to find out.</p>
<h2>Berkeley software distribution</h2>
<p>Mattis and Kimball were roommates at Berkeley majoring in computer science in the early-to-mid-1990s. In addition to their usual studies, they also became involved with the <a href="https://xcf.berkeley.edu/">eXperimental Computing Facility</a> (XCF), an organization of undergraduates who have a keen, almost obsessive interest in CS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CockroachDB was intended to be a global database from the beginning. The founders of Cockroach Labs wanted to ensure that data written in one location would be viewable immediately in another location 10,000 miles away. The use case was simple, but the work needed to make it happen was herculean.</p>
<p>The company is betting the farm that it can solve one of the largest challenges for web-scale applications. The approach it’s taking is clever, but it’s a bit complicated, particularly for the non-technical reader. Given its history and engineering talent, the company is in the process of pulling it off and making a big impact on the database market, making it a technology well worth understanding. In short, there’s value in digging into the details.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Using CockroachDB’s multiregion feature to segment data according to geographic proximity fulfills Cockroach Labs’ primary directive: To get data as close to the user as possible.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">In part 1 of this EC-1</a>, I provided a general overview and a look at the origins of Cockroach Labs. In this installment, I’m going to cover the technical details of the technology with an eye to the non-technical reader. I’m going to describe the CockroachDB technology through three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What makes reading and writing data over a global geography so hard?</li>
<li>How does CockroachDB address the problem?</li>
<li>What does it all mean for those using CockroachDB?</li>
</ol>
<h2>What makes reading and writing data over a global geography so hard?</h2>
<p>Spencer Kimball, CEO and co-founder of Cockroach Labs, describes the situation this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s lots of other stuff you need to consider when building global applications, particularly around data management. Take, for example, the question and answer website Quora. Let’s say you live in Australia. You have an account and you store the particulars of your Quora user identity on a database partition in Australia.</p>
<p>But when you post a question, you actually don&#8217;t want that data to just be posted in Australia. You want that data to be posted everywhere so that all the answers to all the questions are the same for everybody, anywhere. You don’t want to have a situation where you answer a question in Sydney and then you can see it in Hong Kong, but you can&#8217;t see it in the EU. When that’s the case, you end up getting different answers depending where you are. That&#8217;s a huge problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading and writing data over a global geography is challenging for pretty much the same reason that it’s faster to get a pizza delivered from across the street than from across the city. The essential constraints of time and space apply. Whether it’s digital data or a pepperoni pizza, the further away you are from the source, the longer stuff takes to get to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The company behind ubiquitous livestreaming software <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/streamlabs/">Streamlabs</a> is introducing a new way for streamers to share their gaming highlights to platforms well beyond Twitch. Streamlabs calls the new tool <a href="https://crossclip.com/">Crossclip</a>, and it&#8217;s available now as an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crossclip-clip-post-grow/id1568560633">iOS app</a> and as a lightweight web tool.</p>
<p>With Crossclip, creators can easily convert Twitch clips into a format friendly to TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and Facebook videos. Adapting a snippet from Twitch that you&#8217;d like to share is as simple as putting in the clip&#8217;s URL and choosing an output format (landscape, vertical or square) and a pre-loaded layout.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?w=680" alt="Crossclip iOS app" width="680" height="347" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png 2080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=768,391 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=680,347 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=1536,783 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=2048,1044 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can crop the clip&#8217;s length within Crossclip, blur part of the background and choose from a handful of layouts that let you place the frames in different places (to show the facecam view and the stream view together in vertical orientation, for example).</p>
<p>Crossclip&#8217;s core functionality is free, but a premium subscription version ($4.99/month or $49.99/year) removes a branded watermark and unlocks exports in 1080/60fps, larger uploads, added layers and pushes your edits to the front of the processing queue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178091" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="403" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png 1406w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?resize=680,403 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Discovery on Twitch is tough. Established streamers grow their audiences easily but anybody just getting started usually has to slog through long stretches of lonely Stardew Valley sessions with only the occasional viewer popping in to say hi. The idea behind Crossclip is to make it easier for streamers to build audiences on other social networks that have better discoverability features, subcommunities and tags to make that process less grueling.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a creator, making your content more discoverable is a huge advantage,&#8221; Streamlabs Head of Product Ashray Urs told TechCrunch. &#8220;When you consider the most popular Twitch streamers, you will notice that they have extremely popular YouTube channels and actively post on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok. If you aren&#8217;t sharing content and building your audience with different platforms, you&#8217;re making things more difficult for yourself.&#8221;<b></b></p>
<p>Urs notes that creators are increasingly using TikTok&#8217;s algorithmic discovery abilities to grow their audiences. TikTok&#8217;s recent addition of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/"> longer, three-minute videos</a> is a boon for many kinds of creators interested in leveraging the platform, including gamers and other Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>Anyone with an established audience will find Crossclip a breeze to use too, making it dead-simple to share gaming highlights or Just Chatting clips wherever they&#8217;re trying to build up a following. The average clip conversation takes two to three minutes and is a simple one-click process. There are a few tools out there that have similar functionality, independent web tool <a href="https://streamladder.com/">StreamLadder</a> probably being the most notable, but Streamlabs takes the same idea, refines it and adds a mobile app.</p>
<p>Streamlabs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/logitech-acquires-popular-game-streaming-tool-streamlabs-for-around-89m/">now owned by Logitech</a>, has released a few useful products in recent months. In February, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/streamlabs-launches-a-link-in-bio-website-builder-that-includes-tipping/">Willow</a>, its own link-in-bio tool with built-in tipping. In May, Streamlabs <a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-announces-integration-with-tiktok">deepened its relationship with TikTok</a> — an emerging hub for all kinds of gaming content — adding the ability to &#8220;go live&#8221; on TikTok into its core livestreaming platform, Streamlabs OBS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cockroach Labs has many things going for it. The company’s approach to distributed database technology is novel, and it has the potential to gain significant market share internationally.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">In the previous part of this EC-1</a>, we looked at the technical details of CockroachDB and how it provides accurate data instantaneously anywhere on the planet. In this installment, we’re going to take a look at the product side of Cockroach, with a particular focus on developer relations.</p>
<p>As a business, Cockroach Labs has many things going for it. The company’s approach to distributed database technology is novel. And, as more companies operate on a global level, CockroachDB has the potential to gain some significant market share internationally. The company is seven years into a typical 10-year maturity model for databases, has raised $355 million, and holds a $2 billion market value. It’s considered a <a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-raises-160m-series-e-hiring">double unicorn.</a> Few database companies can say this.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The company is now aggressively expanding into the database-as-a-service space, offering its own technology in a fully managed package, expanding the spectrum of clients who can take immediate advantage of its products.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But its growth depends upon securing the love of developers while also making its product easier to use for new customers. To that end, I’m going to analyze the company’s pivot to the cloud as well as its extensive outreach to developers as it works to set itself up for long-term, sustainable success.</p>
<h2>Cockroach Labs looks to the cloud</h2>
<p>These days, just about any company of consequence provides services via the internet, and a growing number of these services are powered by products and services from native cloud providers. Gartner forecasted in 2019 that cloud services are growing at an annual rate of 17.5%, and there’s no sign that the growth has abated at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">Its founders’ history with Google back in the mid-2000s</a> has meant that Cockroach Labs has always been aware of the impact of cloud services on the commercial web. Unsurprisingly, CockroachDB could run cloud native right from its first release, given that its architecture presupposes the cloud in its operation — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">as we saw in part 2 of this EC-1</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CockroachDB’s success is not guaranteed. It has to overcome significant hurdles to secure a profitable place among well-established database technologies owned by companies with very deep pockets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most database startups avoid building relational databases, since that market is dominated by a few goliaths. Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server have embedded themselves into the technical fabric of large- and medium-size companies going back decades. These established companies have a lot of market share and a lot of money to quash the competition.</p>
<p>So rather than trying to compete in the relational database market, over the past decade, many database startups focused on alternative architectures such as document-centric databases (like MongoDB), key-value stores (like Redis) and graph databases (like Neo4J). But Cockroach Labs went against conventional wisdom with CockroachDB: It intentionally competed in the relational database market with its relational database product.</p>
<p>While it did face an uphill battle to penetrate the market, Cockroach Labs saw a surprising benefit: It didn’t have to invent a market. All it needed to do was grab a share of a market that also happened to be growing rapidly.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Cockroach Labs has a bright future, compelling technology, a lot of money in the bank and has an experienced, technically astute executive team.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In previous parts of this EC-1, I looked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">the origins of CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">presented an in-depth technical description of its product</a> as well as an analysis of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-developers/">the company’s developer relations and cloud service</a>, CockroachCloud. In this final installment, we’ll look at the future of the company, the competitive landscape within the relational database market, its ability to retain talent as it looks toward a potential IPO or acquisition, and the risks it faces.</p>
<p>CockroachDB’s success is not guaranteed. It has to overcome significant hurdles to secure a profitable place for itself among a set of well-established database technologies that are owned by companies with very deep pockets.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible, though. We’ll first look at MongoDB as an example of how a company can break through the barriers for database startups competing with incumbents.</p>
<h2>When life gives you Mongos, make MongoDB</h2>

<p>MongoDB is a good example of the risks that come with trying to invent a new database market. The company started out as a purely document-centric database at a time when that approach was the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Web developers like document-centric databases because they address a number of common use cases in their work. For example, a document-centric database works well for storing comments to a blog post or a customer’s entire order history and profile.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The more specialized the BNPL startup, the less likely that Apple's foray into the BNPL space may prove combative; the more general the BNPL player, the more likely that Apple could snag its business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bloomberg broke news earlier this week that Apple, the consumer hardware giant with a rising services focus, is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal">building a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service</a> that will integrate with its Apple Pay system. The news sent shares of Affirm down just over 10% by the end of the day, and it shed 2.5% of its value yesterday. It&#8217;s off a little more than 61% from the highs it set after debuting earlier this year.</p>
<p>In light of information that Apple could cut into Affirm&#8217;s business, investors decided the former consumer fintech unicorn and present-day public BNPL company was worth less. Why? Because rising competition from a player like Apple may limit its growth over time, impacting later profitability. Or more simply, public-market investors decided that the present value of its future cash flows had declined.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not fair to focus on Affirm, of course. Afterpay is also a public BNPL firm; its shares also fell this week, slipping a similar 10% since its close on July 12, the day before the Apple news broke.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Those are just two names. There are a host of rival BNPL concerns in the world, from small startups to private-market giants like Klarna. Affirm and Afterpay, however, as focused companies in the space that also float, make for a useful window into how investors&#8217; views on the sector are changing in light of the recent Apple announcement.</p>
<p>Our question is what impact the Apple news item may have on <em>startups, </em>given that Apple Pay itself already accounts for about 5% of global card transactions (<a href="https://qz.com/1799912/apple-pay-on-pace-to-account-for-10-percent-of-global-card-transactions/">according to one analysis at least</a>). The answer, I think, is that it will vary a lot based on the focus of the BNPL startup in question. The more specialized the BNPL provider, the less likely that Apple&#8217;s eventual foray into the BNPL space may prove combative; the more general the BNPL player, the more likely that Apple could cut into its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Why? Distribution and customer expertise.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that Affirm, Afterpay and other BNPL players are set to follow the dodo; far from it. But if Apple wades into the BNPL market as anticipated, its Apple Pay service could provide a strong distribution network that may ease consumer onboarding. That Apple has also launched a credit card tied to its Apple Pay efforts and offers a lightweight cash-management solution in the United States could also lower the threshold for uptake of the product because consumers are already becoming comfortable with Apple as a banking player of sorts.</p>
<p>Apple also controls massive digital marketplaces, albeit places where BNPL services may prove less pertinent. But it controls brick-and-mortar stores for its own goods around the world, and a global e-commerce operation via its own websites that could provide extra distribution for BNPL services from the company. Simply: Apple sells a lot of pricey products that would be good candidates for BNPL purchases.</p>
<p>All of that will hit some startups. Let&#8217;s talk about which are going to dodge the incoming competitive bullet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It seems like everything is being pushed online now, but network procurement stubbornly has remained an in-person or phone-based negotiation. Lightyear, an early-stage New York City startup, decided to change that last year, and the company announced a $13.1 million Series A today.</p>
<p>The round was led by Ridge Ventures with participation from Zigg Capital and a slew of individual investors. Today&#8217;s investment comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/lightyear-scores-3-7m-seed-to-simplify-networking-infrastructure-procurement/">a $3.7 million seed round</a> last October, bringing the total raised to $16.8 million.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Dennis Thankachan says that the company has been able to gain customers by offering a new way to procure network resources, which was a great improvement over manual negotiating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Last year we launched Lightyear, which was the first tool for buying your telecom infrastructure on the web. And although changing behaviors and the way that enterprises have done things for years is difficult, the status quo in telecom has been zero transparency, no web-based ways to do things, and oftentimes interfacing with really, really large vendors where you have no negotiating leverage even if you&#8217;re a big enterprise. That experience was so poor that a lot of enterprises were extremely happy to see what we put in the market,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>What Lightyear offers is an online marketplace where companies can interact with vendors and get a range of price quotes to make a more informed buying decision. The company spent a lot of time improving the product since last October when you could configure some basic stuff, get a price quote and Lightyear would help you buy it.</p>
<p>Now Thankachan says that the solution covers the full life cycle of services including configuring a bigger array of services, helping manage the installation of the services and helping reduce the amount of delays and errors in installs. Finally, they help track and manage network inventory and can automate renewal for a whole group of services.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EdTAluaPM1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/embedded-procurement-will-make-every-company-its-own-marketplace/">Embedded procurement will make every company its own marketplace</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Embedded procurement will make every company its own marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/embedded-procurement-will-make-every-company-its-own-marketplace/embed/#?secret=EdTAluaPM1" data-secret="EdTAluaPM1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That has resulted in 4X growth in just nine months since the last round. In addition, the company had relationships with 400 vendors in October and has grown that to mid-500 vendors today. The startup has also doubled the number of employees to around 20.</p>
<p>Thankachan says that as a person of color he is particularly cognizant about building a diverse and inclusive culture. &#8220;I&#8217;m a person of color, who has been a minority in different work environments in the past, and I know how that feels and how frustrating that can be for a person who feels like their voice is not heard. [&#8230;] So I think we can start to build a culture that is not necessarily the norm in [the telecommunications industry] by trying to give opportunities to [underrepresented] people,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Yousuf Khan, a partner at Ridge Ventures, who is leading the round and will be joining the board under the terms of the deal, says that as a former CIO he found Lightyear&#8217;s approach quite appealing.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a former CIO and someone who has led global technology operations, it’s refreshing to see Lightyear transforming the way business infrastructure gets bought&#8230;I wish Lightyear existed during my years as a CIO,&#8221; Khan said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The mystery of who will occupy the final seat on Blue Origin&#8217;s debut human spaceflight next week is a mystery no longer: The company revealed today that the winning bidder who forked over $28 million for the privilege is actually going to fly on a later mission, and instead the final seat on the debut flight will go to Oliver Daemen, an 18-year-old high school graduate bound for the University of Utrecht. He&#8217;ll be the youngest person to travel to space, which means this launch will include both the youngest and the oldest people ever to make the trip.</p>
<p>Blue Origin is planning to fly its founder Jeff Bezos to space in just a few days, on July 20, on its debut human spaceflight. That spacecraft will also be carrying Bezos&#8217; brother, along with 82-year-old aerospace pioneer Wally Funk, on the trip to suborbital space for a few minutes of weightlessness and unparalleled views before coming back down for a controlled landing in West Texas.</p>
<p>The final seat was auctioned off via a multistage process that culminated in a live online bidding rally, which brought the final total paid for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-auctions-off-seat-on-first-human-spaceflight-for-28m/">ticket to that whopping $28 million,</a> which is much more than the regular price of the average seat will be during regular commercial flight of the New Shepard spacecraft. That winner, who remains anonymous for now, has declined to go on this one due to &#8220;scheduling conflicts.&#8221; The funds from the ticket auction are actually being donated to charity, however, rather than acting as revenue for Blue Origin in a commercial sense, going instead to its registered nonprofit Club for the Future, which is dedicated to furthering STEM education.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard launch vehicle is designed for suborbital commercial human spaceflight, including both tourism and research uses. The fully reusable system consists of a booster and an upper-stage that includes a crew capsule, and after a series of test flights that began in 2015, Blue Origin is now ready to fly it with people on board for the first time, as a final set of demonstrations before commercial operations start up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora Innovation, the autonomous vehicle startup that acquired Uber&#8217;s self-driving unit in December, is going public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners Y.</p>
<p>The deal announced Thursday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">confirms TechCrunch&#8217;s reporting</a> in June that the startup was in final talks with the SPAC launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson.</p>
<p>The combined company, which will be listed on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol AUR, will have an implied valuation of $13 billion. Aurora was last valued at $10 billion following its acquisition of Uber&#8217;s self-driving unit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through the deal, Aurora is capturing $1 billion from private investors, including Baillie Gifford, funds and accounts managed by Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., PRIMECAP Management Company, Reinvent Capital, XN, Fidelity Management and Research LLC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Index Ventures and Sequoia Capital, as well as strategic investments from Uber, PACCAR and Volvo Group.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Autonomous vehicle startup Aurora in final talks to merge with Reid Hoffman&#8217;s newest SPAC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/embed/#?secret=PwTzsAQxjA" data-secret="PwTzsAQxjA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The combined company said it&#8217;s expected to have about $2.5 billion in cash at closing, including up to $977.5 million of cash held in Reinvent&#8217;s trust account from its initial public offering, which <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1828108/000119312521085839/d128504d8k.htm">closed on March 18, 2021</a>, according to regulatory filings.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a big next step for the company,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Chris Urmson said in an interview Thursday. &#8220;Obviously we need to bring our product to the market, but we really couldn&#8217;t be more excited for our team, the resources this transaction brings and our partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aurora has gone from buzzy startup to publicly traded company-via-SPAC in a span of four years. The company was founded in 2017 by Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell and Urmson, all whom have a history of working on automated vehicle technology.</p>
<p>In December, the company reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s self-driving unit in a complex deal that valued the combined company at $10 billion. Under the terms of that acquisition, Aurora did not pay cash for Uber ATG, a company that was valued at $7.25 billion following a $1 billion investment in 2019 from Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. Uber received a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Since the acquisition, Aurora has spent the past several months integrating Uber ATG employees and now has a workforce of about 1,600 people. Aurora more recently said it reached an agreement with Volvo to jointly develop autonomous semi-trucks for North America. That partnership, which is expected to last several years and is through Volvo&#8217;s Autonomous Solutions unit, will focus on developing and deploying trucks built to operate autonomously on highways between hubs for Volvo customers.</p>
<h2>Venture capital at scale</h2>
<p>Hoffman, Pincus and Thompson have promoted a concept that they call &#8220;venture capital at scale.&#8221; To date, SPACs have been the conduit to reach that scale. The trio have formed three SPACs, or blank-check companies.</p>
<p>Two of those SPACs have announced mergers with private companies. Reinvent Technology Partners announced a deal in February to merge with the electric vertical take-off and landing company Joby Aviation, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Reinvent Technology Partners Z merged with home insurance startup Hippo.</p>
<p>Their third SPAC — the one now merging with Aurora — is called Reinvent Technology Partners Y, and priced its initial public offering of 85 million units at $10 per unit to raise $850 million. The SPAC issued an additional 12.7 million shares to cover over allotments with total gross proceeds of $977 million, according to regulatory filings. The units are listed on the Nasdaq exchange and trade under the ticker symbol &#8220;RTPYU.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Investors Clara Brenner, Quin Garcia and Rachel Holt on SPACs, micromobility and how COVID-19 shaped VC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/investors-clara-brenner-quin-garcia-and-rachel-holt-on-spacs-micromobility-and-how-covid-19-shaped-vc/embed/#?secret=GraIw0m5og" data-secret="GraIw0m5og" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In many ways, the Aurora-Reinvent SPAC is a union that makes sense.</p>
<p>Aurora already has a relationship with Hoffman. In February 2018, Aurora raised $90 million from Greylock Partners and Index Ventures. Hoffman, who is a partner at Greylock, and Index Ventures&#8217; Mike Volpi became board members of Aurora as part of the Series A round. The following year, Aurora raised more than $530 million in a Series B round led by Sequoia Capital and included Amazon and T. Rowe Price Associates. Lightspeed Venture Partners, Geodesic, Shell Ventures and Reinvent Capital also participated in the round, as well as previous investors Greylock and Index Ventures.</p>
<p>Hoffman and Reinvent showing up on two sides of a SPAC deal is not unprecedented. It&#8217;s not commonplace either. Urmson told TechCrunch that to avoid potential conflicts of interest Hoffman didn&#8217;t participate in discussions.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, Reid, given his understanding and history with the company, is one of the people best suited to understand the opportunity here,&#8221; Urmson said in an interview Thursday morning, adding that to avoid a conflict of interest on both sides Hoffman wasn&#8217;t involved in any discussions on the Aurora or Reinveint side.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Doug Landis joined the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event to discuss the value of storytelling for startups -- and how to do it. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How do you go beyond the names and numbers with your startup pitch deck? For Doug Landis, the answer is one simple compound gerund: storytelling. It’s a word that gets thrown around a lot of late in Silicon Valley, but it’s one that could legitimately help your startup stand out from the pack amid the pile of pitches.</p>
<p>Landis knows a fair bit about the concept. Following stints at Salesforce and Google, he served as the “chief storyteller” at Box. These days, Landis is the growth partner at Emergence Capital, where he helps tell the stories of the firm’s portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Landis joined us on the first day of TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event to offer a presentation about the value of storytelling for startups, whittling down the standard two-hour conversation to a 30-minute version. Though he still managed to rewind things pretty far, opening with, “400,000 years ago, men and women used to sit around the fire pit and tell stories about their day, about their hunt, about the one that got away.”</p>
<h2>Connect the dots</h2>
<p>More often than not, decks include a series of numbers and charts. The job of a story pitch is weaving a good narrative around these figures.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you think about storytelling, and you think about the physiological and psychological elements &#8212; what&#8217;s happening between the storytelling and the listener &#8212; we’re actually looking for the patterns. If you think about it, it&#8217;s why those jingles and commercials get stuck in our head, and we can&#8217;t forget it, even though we don&#8217;t even know much about the product. But we remember the jingle, remember the commercial, we remember the brand. Because as humans, we&#8217;re looking for the patterns in our communication. Our job is to connect the facts and fill in the holes. And from those connections, we create a story. We create a story in our brain, because our brain actually processes information through story form.<em><strong> (Timestamp 3:20)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2>Get to the point</h2>
<p>They don’t call it an elevator pitch for nothing. And sometimes even the best storytellers have a habit of rambling. Here’s an exercise for cutting away some of the excess when attempting to get your story in front of VCs.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you tell the story at work, ask your peers or the listener to share back with you in one sentence what the point of that story was. Get immediate feedback, and you can then identify whether or not your story was on target or not. The story needs to be relevant to the audience who&#8217;s there, but the reality is, you need to be very clear about the point you&#8217;re trying to make with a story.<em><strong> (Timestamp 6:33)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zūm, the startup that provides child transportation for school districts and families, is aiming to use its fleet of electric school buses to deliver power back to the electrical grid when it&#8217;s needed most. </span></p>
<p>The company is partnering with AutoGrid, which provides energy management and distribution software, to transform <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zūm&#8217;s fleet of electric school buses into one of the largest virtual power plants in the world, according to a statement from the companies. Zūm eventually plans to have a fleet of 10,000 electric buses by 2025. Once Zūm hits that 10,000 EV bus goal, the company says it will have the capacity to send one gigawatt of energy back to the grid. To put that to scale, that&#8217;s enough to power 110 million LED lightbulbs or 300,000 homes. However, Zūm is far short of that 10,000-bus goal. Currently only 10% of the company&#8217;s buses are electric, due to a shortage of supply, CEO and co-founder Ritu Narayan told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;School buses are the largest battery on wheels,&#8221; said Narayan. &#8220;Interestingly, they are not utilized when there is a peak time for electricity, so either in the evenings or in summertime. So our bigger plan is not only what we are actually using the vehicles for during the daytime.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This scope of the partnership, while a creative way to repurpose school bus fleets, is becoming more common in the electric vehicle industry. As EV ownership increases, companies like Zūm are recognizing the need for a give-and-take when it comes to an increasingly strained energy grid. This week, mobility company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/revel-turns-to-software-to-keep-its-e-moped-fleet-powered-without-straining-nycs-grid/">Revel announced it would work with GridRewards</a>, an app that offers similar services to AutoGrid, in order to adjust its e-moped fleet charging schedule so it can provide power back to the grid if needed. </span></p>

<p>School buses present a big opportunity for such energy sharing, today more than ever. The Biden administration has proposed a $25 billion investment in electric school buses. There are more than 500,000 yellow school buses transporting over 27 million students every day.</p>
<p>The companies are launching the partnership in San Francisco, where Zūm has a fleet of 206 school buses, and in Oakland Unified School District, where it has 70 buses, according to Narayan. Zūm also has aspirations to expand nationwide. The company already works with schools districts in California, as well as Seattle, Chicago and Dallas, and it&#8217;s targeting Washington, D.C. next.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The transition to EVs for the school transportation sector will play a critical role in help</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ing communities improve air quality and environmental health for student passengers a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd area residents,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
