										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s competition watchdog has cleared Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of Kustomer, a maker of CRM tools.</p>
<p>The purchase was announced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/"> last November</a> &#8212; with a price-tag we reported as $1BN &#8212; but is pending closing after facing regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an inquiry on the proposed merger this summer, at the end of July. The European Commission has also been digging into the implications of the deal.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2kvsd8793q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/">Facebook buys Kustomer for $1B to expand into customer service tools</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook buys Kustomer for $1B to expand into customer service tools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/embed/#?secret=2kvsd8793q" data-secret="2kvsd8793q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6151a0da8fa8f5610b9c2208/Facebook.Kustomer_-_Summary_of_Phase_1_Decision_.pdf">summary</a> of its decision to greenlight Facebook&#8217;s latest bit of b2b shopping, the CMA said it looked at whether letting Facebook go ahead and scoop up the customer service software maker would dent competition by raising barriers to entry in the online display advertising market; whether Facebook might harm the competitiveness of customer service tools maker by limiting or degrading their access to its messaging channels; whether the tech giant might harm the competitiveness of other b2c messaging services by preventing them from integrating with Kustomer&#8217;s services; and whether Facebook could rely on cross-subsidizing from its online ads business to undercut competitors by offering Kustomer for free or on a freemium basis, thereby undermining the ability of others to compete.</p>
<p>For each concern (or &#8216;theory of harm&#8217;), the CMA goes on to explain that it was satisfied the acquisition did not meet the required bar of a &#8220;substantial lessening&#8221; of competition.</p>
<p>The small size of Kustomer appears to have helped allay concerns that letting Facebook assimilate the CRM maker might damage the wider market for such business tools.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The CMA considers that, even if some competitors would struggle to respond to Facebook offering Kustomer on a free or freemium basis, sufficient competitive constraints would remain,&#8221; the regulator writes in its conclusion on the last theory of harm, for example, adding that it &#8220;considers that the largest providers may be in a position to adopt a freemium model, or to develop a basic low-price CRM product targeted at small businesses, with the expectation that CRM revenues would increase as businesses’ needs grew&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most importantly, it is not necessary for other CRM providers to replicate the Merged Entity’s strategy in order to remain competitive,&#8221; it also writes. &#8220;While price is certainly an important dimension of competition, there are several other dimensions along which CRM providers could compete against the Merged Entity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the green light in a statement, a Facebook spokesperson sought to spin the clearance as a positive endorsement of the deal as a boon to competitors, writing: “We welcome the CMA’s decision, which shows that this deal is good for competition. The transaction will increase competition and bring more innovation to businesses and consumers in the dynamic and competitive CRM and business messaging spaces. More people will benefit from customer service that is faster, richer and available whenever and however they need it.”</p>
<p>While the CMA has decided there&#8217;s nothing to see here, the EU is still considering whether to clear Facebook-Kustomer. So the regulatory scrutiny continues.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s Kustomer buy could face EU probe after merger referral&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebooks-kustomer-buy-could-face-eu-probe-after-merger-referral/embed/#?secret=Ob9lmSmW05" data-secret="Ob9lmSmW05" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A Commission spokesperson had no comment on the CMA&#8217;s clearance &#8212; but confirmed its own &#8220;in-depth investigation&#8221; is ongoing, adding that there&#8217;s a provisional deadline of January 7, 2022, for EU regulators to take their own decision.</p>
<p>Despite the CMA&#8217;s relatively quick clearance of this particular Facebook purchase, the UK regulator does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">continue to dig into competition concerns</a> attached to Facebook&#8217;s earlier acquisition of animated Gif platform, Giphy.</p>
<p>After a finding of provisional concerns on Facebook-Giphy earlier this summer, it proposed remedies that could include ordering Facebook to unwind the acquisition &#8212; leading the tech giant to respond with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-fights-british-watchdog-retain-gif-maker-giphy-2021-09-08/">a stinging rebuttal of any harms</a>, earlier this month, accusing the regulator of making &#8220;fundamental errors&#8221; in its assessment of the competitive implications of that deal.</p>
<p>Regulatory scrutiny of big tech&#8217;s acquisitions in the region tends to focus on a fairly narrow consideration of competitive harms &#8212; such as how the CMA has looked at the Kustomer buy through the lens of the overall competitiveness of the CRM market.</p>
<p>However, in the Kustomer case, <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/questions-about-facebooks-acquisition-of-kustomer/">concerns</a> have also been raised about the privacy implications of letting adtech giant Facebook get its hands on the support service&#8217;s customer data given that the smaller company operates in sectors including <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/industry/healthcare/">the health sector</a> where it is likely to be processing sensitive information on behalf of its customers.</p>
<p>Back in February, for instance, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) raised a series of privacy concerns in a letter to Facebook &#8212; which it also <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/digital-data/questions-about-facebooks-acquisition-of-kustomer/">published online</a>, querying what uses the tech giant would be making for customer data held by Kustomer and asking whether such data would be combined with any other data held by Facebook and Facebook-owned companies.</p>
<p>Months later tbe ICCL <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/facebooks-kustomer-buy-could-face-eu-probe-after-merger-referral/">said</a> it had not had any response from Facebook to the letter raising privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Despite Europe&#8217;s comprehensive data protection framework &#8212; which is supposed to help safeguard people&#8217;s digital information &#8212; competition watchdogs in the region rarely consider privacy implications as part of their assessments of digital markets.</p>
<p>And there have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">calls for more joined up working</a> between competition and privacy regulators in order to properly tackle the market effects and consumer harms that can flow from digital giants&#8217; command of other people&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>One outlier on this front is German&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office which has been doing just that &#8212; in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">pioneering case against Facebook&#8217;s superprofiling</a> (which is ongoing).</p>

You&#8217;ll find the $5 tenders at Walmart and other major grocery chains starting in October, though only in select markets. Beyond expects to expand availability later this year.</p>
<p>The company says its tenders have 50 percent less saturated fat than ones made with actual chicken, and have no GMOs, antibiotics, hormones or cholesterol. Beyond uses faba beans rather than a soy-based recipe in its attempt to replicate the taste and texture of a chicken tender. It says you&#8217;ll be able to heat up the pre-cooked tenders in under 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Along with Walmart, Beyond&#8217;s tenders will be available at some Jewel-Osco, Safeway NorCal, Harris Teeter, Giant Foods and ShopRite stores at the outset. Meanwhile, Beyond says it&#8217;s increasing availability of its products at Walmart. It&#8217;ll bring Breakfast Sausage Patties to more than 1,300 additional stores, while more locations will offer Beyond Meatballs and Beyond Beef Crumbles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy month in the plant-based meat alternative ecosystem. Beyond competitor Impossible started selling its &#8220;chicken&#8221; nuggets in restaurants <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-chicken-nuggets-130035016.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>a few weeks ago</ins></a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an Extra Crunch summer. We&#8217;ve heard how to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/craft-your-pitch-deck-around-that-one-thing-that-can-really-hook-an-investor/">craft your pitch deck around the one thing that really hooks an investor</a>, and how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/how-retail-ziplines-series-a-pitch-deck-ticked-every-box-for-emergence-capital/">the industry experience of Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong ticked every box for Emergence</a> when raising her Series A. And that&#8217;s just the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">tip of the iceberg</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also gotten a sneak peek at the Disrupt Startup Alley companies in our summer episodes of Extra Crunch Live: Startup Alley Edition.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more where that came from this fall. Without any further ado, check out the incredible speakers joining us on upcoming episodes of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, we&#8217;re changing the name. Henceforth, ECL shall be known as TechCrunch Live. Here&#8217;s why: We realized that hanging out with TechCrunch in this context should be accessible to everyone. We interview startup founders and the investors that finance them to learn how the deal actually gets done, and we have folks in the audience pitch to get the expert feedback of our guests. Everyone should be able to benefit from that.</p>
<p>Because of that, we&#8217;re calling the series TechCrunch Live, as the live event hasn&#8217;t been an EC member perk for quite some time. Although the live portion is free upon registration, the video replays from TechCrunch Live will remain behind the paywall.</p>
<p>So, let me try that again.</p>
<p>Here are the upcoming speakers joining us on TechCrunch Live in October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Nicole Quinn (Lightspeed Venture Partners) + Vlad Novakovski (Lunchclub)</h3>

<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>A few things this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instagram is pausing work on the kids-focused version of its social service. It claims that the product is the right thing to build, but that it wants to talk to folks about why, first. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">TechCrunch has more here</a>.</li>
<li>Shares of Box are up this morning, after the company endured a period of time in the wilderness.</li>
<li>Google is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/26/google-lowers-its-cloud-marketplace-revenue-share-to-3percent-from-20percent.html">cutting its cloud app marketplace take rate</a> as marketplaces more broadly lose their ability to accrete economic value as middlepeople.</li>

<li>And from Sweden, EV company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/26/swedish-ev-maker-polestar-reportedly-preparing-to-go-spac-at-21b-valuation/">Polestar may go public via a SPAC</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/e-motorcycle-maker-cake-closes-60m-round-to-scale-production-and-retail-sales/">EV company Cake raises $60 million</a>.

<li>And looking ahead, Amplitude will set a reference price this evening and direct list tomorrow. Warby Parker will set an IPO price tomorrow evening, and trade on Wednesday.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-maps-introduces-new-ways-to-explore-major-cities-in-3d/">bringing</a> its 3D maps to more cities within the Apple Maps app, including London, L.A., New York, and San Francisco. The experience, launching with iOS 15, follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/apple-maps-rebuild/">several years of investment</a> in Apple&#8217;s mapping platform to make the app more competitive with the market leader, Google Maps. This has included not only the addition of 3D maps, like those arriving now to major markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-maps-upgrade-brings-more-detailed-maps-transit-features-ar-view-and-more/">but also overall more detailed maps</a>, improved transit features, AR viewing modes, and more.</p>
<p>Many of these features have taken time to roll out, with major metros around the U.S. and world being the first to gain the enhancements. AR viewing, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-maps-upgrade-brings-more-detailed-maps-transit-features-ar-view-and-more/">only began launching</a> to select cities this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208486" style="width: 495px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208486" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2208486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?w=485" alt="" width="485" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=768,1076 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=485,680 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=1096,1536 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-SF_09272021.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208486" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>With 3D maps, however, Apple Maps users will be able to see more details for areas across the city including their neighborhoods, commercial districts, marinas, buildings, and more, the company says, along with elevation details, new road labels, and even custom-designed landmarks.</p>
<p>For example, Apple Maps will show renderings for famous spots, like Coit Tower in San Francisco, Dodger Stadium in L.A., the Statue of Liberty in NYC, and the Royal Albert Hall in London, with more landmarks to come in time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208490" style="width: 495px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208490" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2208490" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?w=485" alt="" width="485" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=768,1076 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=485,680 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=1096,1536 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Detailed-NY_09272021.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208490" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Later this year, these sorts of 3D maps will become available in Philadelphia, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., Apple says. Then, next year, they&#8217;ll arrive in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple is also enhancing its road-level navigation in Apple Maps, with more clearly displayed turn lanes, medians, bus, and taxi lanes, and crosswalks. These appear in a 3D viewing mode which makes it easier to see the best lane to choose based on traffic conditions or make better route planning purposes. The app will also display the estimated time of arrival, based on the current conditions, as Google Maps does. This new navigation, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-maps-upgrade-brings-more-detailed-maps-transit-features-ar-view-and-more/">previously announced</a> for a 2021 release, will arrive in CarPlay later this year, Apple said, without giving a more specific deadline.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208487" style="width: 495px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208487" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2208487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=485" alt="" width="485" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,1076 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=485,680 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1096,1536 1096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Apple_Apple-Maps_Navigation_09272021_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Similarly, other major maps updates which had been announced earlier this year, are also now rolling out. This includes transit features designed to make Apple Maps more competitive with third-party apps often favored by transit takers, like Citymapper. Now, nearby transit stations are prominently displayed at the top of the screen and users can pin favorite lines in Maps for easy access. And once a route is selected, Maps will automatically notify users when it&#8217;s time to disembark &#8212; something users can track on their Apple Watch, too.</p>
<p>Apple Maps offers more immersive walking directions with step-by-step guidance powered by augmented reality. This allows users to raise their phone to scan the buildings in their area, which lets Maps generate a more accurate position in order to provide more detailed guidance. This has been rolling out to select markets over the course of the year.</p>
<p>iOS 15 users can also view a new 3D globe of the earth and they can tap an Explore Guides button in the Apple Maps app to access curated Guides from brands like Time Out, The Washington Post, the National Park Foundation, Complex, and The Infatuation These will offer suggestions about things to do or see in various cities worldwide. Users can also make guides of their own to share with friends and family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a big year for Nintendo news. Between the impossible fever dream of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/nintendo-announced-that-chris-pratt-will-play-mario-on-the-big-screen/">last week’s Super Mario movie casting</a> and the eagerly anticipated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/nintendo-teases-2022-release-for-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-and-releases-zelda-game-watch-to-tide-us-over/">sequel to the Switch’s best game</a>, it’s easy to lose track of the other big developments from the gaming giant.</p>
<p>Nintendo recently held an intimate (and sufficiently socially distanced) event in New York, bringing together two of its biggest products launching ahead of the holidays. The first is the arrival of the first 2D Metroid title in 19 years. The title was a surprise announcement during this year’s virtual E3.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208237" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208237" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2208237" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN07.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208237" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>In many ways, Metroid Dread took centerstage at the briefing, complete with cardboard character cutouts from the game, mood lighting and related sound effects being piped over the PA. More than anything, Nintendo wants to make it clear that the title is more than just a stopgap between now and whatever undetermined time in the future when the company finally releases Metroid Prime 4.</p>
<p>Of course, a game doesn’t mean much without something to play it on. That’s where the new Nintendo Switch &#8212; OLED Model &#8212; comes in. Yes, that’s t1he full, glorious name &#8212; and for what’s worth, the company has been pronouncing it O-L-E-D. It’s a bit jarring (and clumsy) at first for someone who’s grown so accustom to pronouncing the screen technology phonetically.</p>

<p>If Metroid Dread was a slight disappointment for some of the fan-base due to it, well, not being Prime 4, the initial Switch OLED (as I will henceforth be referring to it) fell short of what many were expecting/hoping the company would be announcing on the hardware front. After all, at 3.5 years old, the Switch seems primed for a big makeover. Refresh cycles being what they are for consoles, hardware makers love to juice sales in their middle-age with some compelling new model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This serves the dual-purpose of (hopefully) bringing long-time holdouts on board and convincing the devoted it’s time to upgrade to something shiny and new. It’s worth noting that, in mid-2019, Nintendo did introduce two models. There was a refresh of the standard Switch that addressed far and away the system’s biggest downside: battery. The company also added the $200 Switch Lite &#8212; a more affordable and portable version of the console that helped get me through the first year of this pandemic in one piece.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208238" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208238" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2208238" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN013.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208238" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>Rumors of a Switch Pro were at full-force ahead of E3. What arrived was, for many, underwhelming, featuring the same RAM and processor (Nvidia Tegra X1) as its predecessor and a slightly larger display (0.8 inches) than its predecessor. The seven-inch OLED is still 720p (1080p when docked), and not the the 4K some were expecting. It does add some other features, like a wired LAN connection and double the storage to 64GB, without ditching the microSD slot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208244" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208244" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2208244" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0134.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208244" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Waiting to play, I snapped a few quick shots of some OLED models on display, showcasing demos of Mario Kart. The system is striking in its black and white stormtrooper colors. When I finally got my hands on the system, the first thing that struck me was the weight. Granted, playing the Switch Lite for the past year has messed with my perspective on the matter, but the Switch OLED is also heavier than its predecessor, up to 0.93 pounds from 0.88.</p>
<p>While not improving the resolution, the new OLED technology does bring some upgrades &#8212; namely deeper blacks and higher contrast than the original. It’s fitting then &#8212; and likely not entirely coincidental &#8212; that the system launches with a dark, subterranean title like Metroid Dread. It’s a nice combo, and the improved sound offers a tactile feedback for loud sounds &#8212; something you get a lot of when firing rockets from your arm cannon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208236" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208236" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2208236" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Swich_MetroidDread_ComsBroll_SCRN06.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208236" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>Still, the Switch OLED may be a hard sell for those who have the original. Metroid Dread, on the other, is a bit more of a no-brainer. I was only afforded the time to play the early stages, but the game triggered the same sensory receptors that made the original (and subsequent side-scrollers). The pulsating alien life forms are still in full-effect, now battling alongside the relentless and (in the early stage, at least) seemingly invulnerable E.M.M.I. robots that populate the game from the beginning.</p>
<p>Metroid Dread and the new Nintendo Switch OLED Model arrive together on October 8. The new system runs $350.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin&#8217;s second human spaceflight will have a space industry veteran and sector-focused investor on board when it takes off: Dr. Chris Boshuizen, co-founder of Planet Labs and current partner at venture capital firm DCVC. Boshuizen will occupy one of four seats on Blue Origin&#8217;s next trip of its New Shepard fully reusable suborbital spacecraft with people on board, following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">debut journey earlier this year with Jeff Bezos</a>.</p>
<p>Boshuizen has his PhD in Physics from the University of Sydney, and was a NASA space mission architect at the Ames Research Center in California for four years before going on to found Planet Labs and serve as its CTO during its first five years of operation. He originally joined DCVC as an entrepreneur in residence after that, before becoming an operation partner and then a full-time partner earlier this year.</p>
<p>While he&#8217;s spent his entire career in the space industry, Boshuizen says that his ambitions to actually go to space started earlier still: He applied for pilot school in the Australian Defense Force Academy when he was just 17 but tested as partially color blind so he was disqualified from continuing.</p>
<p>The current smallsat and CubeSat boom actually owes a lot to Boshuizen, too: When he was working at NASA, he helped invent the &#8216;Phonesat,&#8217; which was an orbital satellite effectively built from a modified smartphone. The primary reason micro satellite constellations exist today in such high numbers is that the miniaturization of high-tech components spurred by the rise of the smartphone made small, powerful satellites that are relatively affordable to build and launch possible.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t yet know other details about the Blue Origin flight Boshuizen will be on, including the exact date and time, but earlier in the year Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith suggested it could happen either late this month or next.</p>
<p>Boshuizen joined us <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/3-vcs-discuss-space-junk-and-what-else-theyre-betting-on-right-now/">last year at TC Sessions: Space</a>, and the next event is coming up in December — still plenty of time to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">grab your tickets</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The head of Instagram has just <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids-and-announcing-parental-supervision">announced</a> that it&#8217;s &#8220;pausing&#8221; a planned version of the social media software aimed at under 13 year olds. The development comes hard of the heels of critical reporting in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">Wall Street Journal</a> which unearthed internal documents that suggest the Facebook-owned company was aware the social media service <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">caused anxiety and mental health issues in teenaged girls</a>.</p>
<p>Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri references the WSJ report in a Twitter thread today &#8212; but he tries to play down the impact of the investigative journalism, seeking to re-spin the &#8216;pause&#8217; as intentional and thoughtful as opposed to a panicked reaction to extremely negative revelations about the impact of the service on the mental health of young girls.</p>
<p>The WSJ obtained an internal research slide from 2019 &#8212; in which Instagram&#8217;s parent Facebook acknowledged “we make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.”</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re pausing our project to build an Instagram experience for tweens, often referred to as &#8216;Instagram Kids&#8217;,&#8221; wrote Mosseri in a <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442457312954920967">series of tweets</a> today.</p>
<p>&#8220;This experience was never meant for kids. We were designing an experience for tweens (10-12yo), and it was never going to be the same as Instagram today. Parents approve tween accounts and have oversight over who they follow, who follows them, who messages them, time spent etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the project leaked way before we knew what it would be. People feared the worst, and we had few answers at that stage. Recent WSJ reporting caused even greater concern. It’s clear we need to take more time on this.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re pausing our project to build an Instagram experience for tweens, often referred to as “Instagram Kids,” and announcing that we are building optional parental controls for teens. More here: <a href="https://t.co/fWwkK5yu6R">https://t.co/fWwkK5yu6R</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Adam Mosseri <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f637.png" alt="😷" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@mosseri) <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442457312954920967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If &#8216;taking more time&#8217; is a euphemism for &#8216;never&#8217;, Mosseri&#8217;s conclusion might be welcomed by the scores of child protection groups and stakeholders who have been urging Facebook to ditch the plan for months.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/facebook-instagram-for-kids-state-attorneys-general-letter/">May</a>, for instance, attorneys general from 44 U.S. states and territories penned a letter to Facebook calling on it to abandon its plan for an Instagram for under 13s.</p>
<p>Mosseri, however, has previously sought to play down concerns around the app’s negative impact on teens &#8212; dismissing them as “quite small”, as we reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">earlier this month</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IBHYuDIg5E"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">Facebook knows Instagram harms teens. Now, its plan to open the app to kids looks worse than ever</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook knows Instagram harms teens. Now, its plan to open the app to kids looks worse than ever&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/embed/#?secret=IBHYuDIg5E" data-secret="IBHYuDIg5E" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Critics will see this as a concession that the project is a bad idea. That’s not it,&#8221; the Instagram CEO went on to claim in today&#8217;s tweet thread announcing the shelving of the project &#8212; before going on to fear-monger that alternative apps under 13s might find and use could be way worse. So, uh, stay classy, Mosseri&#8230;</p>
<p>In an additional announcement that&#8217;s bundled with the headline-grabbing news it&#8217;s pulling Instagram &#8216;tweens&#8217; (as Mosseri couches it), the social media giant also reveals it&#8217;s building what it calls &#8220;optional parental controls for teens&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time of writing the link to Instagram&#8217;s blog post about this change was not working so details are scant &#8212; but the move implies that the Facebook-owned company is feeling the heat in the wake of revelations that, per the WSJ&#8217;s reporting of its internal documents, 32% of teenage girls reported that Instagram made them have a worse body image.</p>
<p>The WSJ report also cited that, of research participants who experienced suicidal thoughts, 13% of British teens and 6% of American teens directly linked their interest in killing themselves to Instagram.</p>
<p>“Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,” another internal slide stated. “This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Optimove's customer relationship management marketing platform helps brands keep customers coming back.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When businesses can connect more personally with their customers, those customers in turn are more loyal. However, as consumer behavior changes, especially as it did over the past 18 months, it is more difficult to establish that connection amid all of the messages put in front of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.optimove.com/">Optimove</a>, specializing in customer relationship management marketing, wants to help brands “delight” their customers and keep them coming back. The company, with bases in Tel Aviv, New York and London, raised a $75 million growth investment led by Summit Partners.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208183" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208183" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208183 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg 1051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pini_Headshot.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208183" class="wp-caption-text">Pini Yakuel, founder and CEO of Optimove, <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Optimove</p></div></p>
<p>The SaaS company was founded in 2012 by CEO Pini Yakuel to connect customers with brands and to apply artificial intelligence to customer data to orchestrate the right message to the right customer at the right time, and do it at scale, Yakuel told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“It’s easier when you are creating three or five customer journeys a month, but when you really scale and want to do thousands, there is not an easy way to do that,” he added. “We do that with AI orchestrators that govern all of the messages. Now you can define the message and the marketer will have all of the data and be able to get feedback and analysis of what the customer segment looks like.”</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/multichannel-marketing-market-3949">global multichannel marketing market</a> is expected to reach $28 billion by 2027, Yakuel said it will be an advantage to know who a brand’s customers are and how to target them. Optimove’s analysis of the data provides insights on how to achieve and attribute measurable improvement in such areas as churn, conversion, reactivation and lifetime value for each customer and campaign.</p>
<p>Prior to this investment, Optimove was bootstrapped for the first four years until raising $20 million. Yakuel said the company hasn’t used the money yet — it has been profitable so far. He considers the round to be Summit Partners, which is buying out the company’s earlier investors, as making a bigger commitment to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It is a transition and phase into a new era,” he added. “It felt like the right time for us given the specific climate of fundraising. We also want to do some M&amp;A and build out our platform, but that all has to be done seamlessly. To use us today, a business may also have to use three or four other solutions and stitch them together. If we can own some of those capabilities, we can be better partners.”</p>
<p>In addition to M&amp;A, the company plans to double its staff of 300 over the next two years and invest in technology, R&amp;D and engineering to serve its 500 brand customers, including BetMGM, Papa John’s and Staples.</p>
<p>In the past year, the company saw an increase of 40% annual recurring revenue, and it sends more than 23 billion optimized messages via email, mobile, ad platforms and other channels, to over 3 billion customers annually. Next up for the company, Yakuel expects the next milestone to be an initial public offering in three years.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding, the company said Summit Partners’ head of Europe, Han Sikkens, and managing director, Steffan Peyer, are joining its board of directors.</p>
<p>Peyer said Summit invests in companies that are focused on marketing technology and are out to understand the customer journey, especially as that has become more important during the global pandemic. During this time, the cost of acquiring new customers has risen and this is where Optimove is most beneficial — enabling engagement with existing user bases, he added.</p>
<p>“What they have done is build a sophisticated customer data platform, with a sophisticated analytics orchestration engine, predicated on understanding and review the behavior of the customer and targeting micro segment campaigns to ensure the engagement level is good, and if there are other products that could be sold to a particular customer,” Peyer said. “Their modeling has a strong backend infrastructure to process data at scale and leverage that information in real time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Southeast Asian e-commerce giant Shopee, which recently expanded to several Latin American nations, appears to be preparing to launch in another international market: India.</p>
<p>The company, owned by Singapore-headquartered Sea, has quietly launched a website for sellers in India, TechCrunch has learned, following <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/shopee-dips-toe-india-e-commerce-market-with-seller-recruitment-campaign-2021-08-30/">months-long subtle campaign</a> to attract merchants in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>The six-year-old e-commerce service, which was seen as a late entrant in Southeast Asia, is already onboarding sellers in India and says on the website that they can start to accept orders from customers, according to screenshots and other materials reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>On another internal website, the company touts that it will not charge sellers any commission fee and provide free shipping and timely payments.</p>
<p>A person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that the Southeast Asian giant is “testing the waters” in India and has yet to finalize plans about any launch. Shopee declined to comment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208445" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208445" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208445 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shopee-india-seller.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shopee-india-seller.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shopee-india-seller.jpg?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shopee-india-seller.jpg?resize=300,106 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shopee-india-seller.jpg?resize=768,272 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shopee-india-seller.jpg?resize=680,241 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shopee-india-seller.jpg?resize=1536,544 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shopee-india-seller.jpg?resize=2048,725 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shopee-india-seller.jpg?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208445" class="wp-caption-text">Shopee India seller website (TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>The company has also posted detailed guides to help merchants sign up to the platform, comply with local tax guidelines, and learn how to process bulk orders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the website, Shopee has disclosed the name of the local Indian entity that is operating the service in the country, and filings accessed from India’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs confirmed that a company with such ID had been incorporated two months ago.</p>
<p>Shopee, which runs a marketplace, connects customers with sellers. The mobile-focused service also offers several social features such as the ability for customers to follow buyers on the app to get updates, and users can also message any seller &#8212; without having to make a purchase first.</p>
<p>The Indian e-commerce market, which is currently dominated by Flipkart and Amazon, is expected to be worth $133 billion by 2025, up from $24 billion in 2018, according to analysts at Bernstein.</p>
<p>Social commerce is also beginning to gain traction in India with two clear leaders. Bangalore-based Meesho is in talks to raise at a $5 billion valuation, Indian daily Economic Times reported last week, and Jaipur-based DealShare has started to hold conversations with investors to raise a new financing round at over $1 billion valuation, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regional seed and early-stage venture capital firm, <a href="http://www.flat6labs.com/program/flat6labs-cairo/">Flat6Labs</a>, has finished raising $10 million for its seed fund targeted at Tunisian startups, according to a statement released by the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed fund, called <a href="https://flat6labs.com/funds/anava-seed-fund/">Anava Seed Fund</a> (ASF), at first sought a close of $3 million but instead closed 3.3x of the initial figure. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund represents the increasing investments in early-stage African startups, mainly North African ones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Flat6Labs completed the close of its Egypt-based fund &#8212;</span><a href="https://flat6labs.com/flat6labs-closes-egp-207-million-of-its-fac-egypt-fund-and-increases-cash-offering-for-startups/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat6Labs Accelerator Company fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (FAC) at $13 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat6Labs launched in 2011 with offices in Egypt and Tunisia, establishing its Cairo programme and the ASF in 2017. The latter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was effected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in partnership with the Tunisian American Enterprise Fund, BIAT Bank and Meninx Holding. The plan was to invest in up to 90 Tunisian early-stage startups within five years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the Anava Seed Fund has invested in over 50 startups in seed, follow-on, and pre-Series A stages.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208438" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208438" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2208438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat6Labs-Tunis-Team.jpg?w=680" alt="Flat6Labs Tunis Team" width="680" height="503" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat6Labs-Tunis-Team.jpg 2181w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat6Labs-Tunis-Team.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat6Labs-Tunis-Team.jpg?resize=300,222 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat6Labs-Tunis-Team.jpg?resize=768,568 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat6Labs-Tunis-Team.jpg?resize=680,503 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat6Labs-Tunis-Team.jpg?resize=1536,1136 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat6Labs-Tunis-Team.jpg?resize=2048,1515 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat6Labs-Tunis-Team.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208438" class="wp-caption-text">Flat6Labs Tunis Team</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Flat6Labs CEO Ramez El-Serafy said completing the ASF fund is a step in the right direction for North African markets to actualize its untapped potential and business opportunities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to see that more and more investors are sharing our enthusiasm towards this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growing market by increasing their commitments in both FAC Egypt Fund and Anava Seed Fund,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We look forward to expanding our impact even further in North Africa with the support of our investors and partners.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such investor is the accelerator&#8217;s longstanding partner Sawari Ventures. In April, the MENA-focused venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/sawari-ventures-finally-closes-71m-fund-for-north-african-startups/">closed a $71 million fund</a> &#8212; one of the largest indigenous funds in the region and Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to setting aside one-tenth of its fund for Flat6Labs seed-stage companies in Egypt and Tunisia, it supported ASF with $1.6 million, according to the Tunis-based fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across North Africa, Flat6Labs has backed numerous startups with more than $10.5 million via both seed funds. They have gone on to raise over $37 million in follow-on funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While several funds have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to back North African startups this year, other funds have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been targeted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at micro funds as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, with Flat6Labs, Sawari Ventures, and Algebra Ventures raising impressive sums for startups at various stages,</span><a href="https://www.wamda.com/2021/05/giz-launches-Euro-100-million-funding-programme-time-fund-managers"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">GIZ Egypt launched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a €100 million funding programme for fund managers based in the MENA region back in May</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

The Series A is led by Eight Road Venutres, with <span style="font-weight: 400;">MMC Ventures, Crane Venture Partners and Winton Ventures Limited &#8212; all existing backers &#8212; also participating. SenseOn &#8212; not to be confused with cabinet security business <a href="http://senseon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senseon</a> &#8212; previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/senseon-raises-6-4m-to-tackle-cybersecurity-threats-with-an-ai-triangulation-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $6.4 in a seed round of funding</a> in 2019.</span></p>
<p>The funding is coming the back of very strong growth, both the bad and good kind.</p>
<p>The bad growth is the sort that we unfortunately hear about every day, in the form of cybersecurity breaches: SenseOn estimates that compromised records passed the 37 billion mark in 2020 &#8212; up 141% over 2019.</p>
<p>The good growth is that SenseOn itself has been rising to the challenge for its customers, and as a result its own business has grown (in revenues and engagements) by over 350%. The London-based startup, founded and led by David Atkinson — who had previously been the commercial director for Darktrace and before that spent years pioneering new cybersecurity techniques at the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense as well as other military and government roles &#8212; counts a number of financial services firms, consumer businesses and government organizations among its customers.</p>
<p>The problem that SenseOn has identified is that the world of security today has evolved to contain a plethora of point solutions, as well as differing approaches within those point solutions, to address different aspects of the cybersecurity challenge. While some of these are very effective, they are only taking on some of the battle, and if an organization wants to adopt the most secure policy, it might use a number of these in tandem, which in turn can slow down systems and response, or create other issues within them.</p>
<p>SenseOn&#8217;s solution has been to build a system that essentially aims to do everything together, with some parts of the solution built by itself, and some parts integrating with other products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Atkinson describes the approach not unlike &#8220;how a human analyst thinks&#8221; (which is why the AI aspect of the service, balancing different streams of information, is central to the approach). He also says it is similar to how a global positioning system works: &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">the more satellites [a GPS] triangulates off, the more accurate it is.&#8221;<img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2208434" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?w=298" alt="" width="298" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=298,300 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=768,773 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=676,680 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/senseon-david-atkinson-military1a-1.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And t</span>o borrow a little from Atkinson&#8217;s previous role in the military (he&#8217;s pictured here, on the right, in a helicopter in Afghanistan years ago), SenseOn is building not just weapons that security specialists can use to do their jobs better &#8212; the platform and the apps &#8212; but also ammunition &#8212; in the form of data that SenseOn picks up and organizes &#8212; to use with those weapons.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the fragmentation inherent in a lot of the most intelligent security technology point solutions, and tackling that by integrating different silos of information to create more complete pictures, is something that seems to be catching on. I&#8217;d also argue that it is a sign of the industry maturing, with possibly some distinct platforms emerging as a result.</p>
<p>Cybellum, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/lg-is-acquiring-automotive-cybersecurity-startup-cybellum-in-a-240m-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG acquired last week</a>, is taking the same approach but focusing specifically on automotive security (which itself is also very fragmented because of the multiple OEMs and technology systems involved). Others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/actzero-emerges-from-stealth-with-40m-for-a-suite-of-cybersecurity-solutions-aimed-at-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActZero</a> are taking the same approach but specifically for one segment of the market, SMBs. Others are looking at specific pain points that result from the fragmentation, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/secureframe-series-a-cybersecurity-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secureframe</a> with security compliance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/axonius-nabs-100m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-for-its-asset-management-cybersecurity-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axonius</a> with managing a plethora of endpoints, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/varmour-the-multi-cloud-security-startup-raises-58m-en-route-to-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vArmour</a> with the challenges of working across multiple clouds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making a platform play is significantly more ambitious, in particular in a market with so many strong point solutions, but with a lot of traction already for SenseOn, it&#8217;s a bet that investors want to take. “SenseOn is poised to become a global cybersecurity leader,&#8221; said Alston Zecha of Eight Roads Ventures in a statement. &#8220;We have long looked for a company which coordinates detection intelligently across domains and can consolidate multiple tools into one solution. SenseOn does this and more. We are privileged to partner with such a thoughtful and high-integrity group as Dave and team.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Customer service is thought of as “the caboose” of a business, but Thankful believes it should be the driver of a brand's post-purchase strategy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Customer service is one of the most important relationships between a business and its customer, and that was made even more clear during the global pandemic.</p>
<p>Though <a href="https://www.thankful.ai/">Thankful</a> AI CEO Ted Mico and his co-founder Evan Tann didn’t start out with experience from the business side, they started the Venice, California-based company in 2018 out of frustration as customers.</p>
<p>“Companies will offer you a chat box, but no value along with it and a method that consumes vast amounts of time, and we thought we could change that,” Mico told TechCrunch. “There were statistics that I read in media articles that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2017/09/25/customer-service-is-a-350b-industry-and-its-a-mess/?sh=7bff81b11bea">customer service was a $350 billion business</a>, a large total addressable market, but it is a mess. We also read that we spend something like 43 days of our lives dealing with customer services. Well, Thankful is here to give you three weeks of your life back.”</p>
<p>Traditionally, customer service is thought of as “the caboose” of a business, but Thankful believes it should be the driver. As a result, companies spend large amounts of money in marketing to get a customer’s attention, but when there is a problem or a customer has questions, it is a customer service team that comes in with little to no knowledge of any existing relationship, Mico added.</p>
<p>That’s the paradigm that Thankful wants to shift. After being founded, the company spent more than two years building out its artificial intelligence customer service software. Mico called it “the application layer on top of the help desk,” to handle large volumes of customer queries across any written channel that a customer wants to use, like email, social, in-app, chat or text. The platform has processed and learned from over 30 million customer service tickets so far.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Customer care as a service: Outsourcing can help your startup wow clients 24/7&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/customer-care-as-a-service-outsourcing-can-help-your-startup-wow-clients-24-7/embed/#?secret=UGZBqR8xUW" data-secret="UGZBqR8xUW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It has three products: the first is an agent assist that helps a human agent resolve problems by intelligently routing and suggesting replies, enabling the agent to be up to 40% more efficient. The second is an AI agent that manages the entire process, not only cutting the time to first response, but also resolving up to 50% of queries. The third is Thankful’s analytics, which is just getting started, to provide data on what customers are saying about their journey.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, Mico said the company has quietly curated a customer list that includes over 50 brands, including UntuckIt, FabFitFun and MeUndies. It is also partnering on the help desk side with companies like Zendesk, Kustomer and Gladly.</p>
<p>Also during that time period, the company experienced 400% year over year growth. To continue to meet that demand, Thankful closed a new $12 million round of Series A funding. Joining Alpha Edison is Bonfire, Ten-One-Ten, Greycroft, Omega and Miramar. That, along with an unannounced $3 million, gives the company a total of $15 million in funding.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208083" style="width: 1224px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208083" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208083 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png" alt="" width="1214" height="906" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png 1214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png?resize=768,573 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Thankful-Agent-Assist.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1214px) 100vw, 1214px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208083" class="wp-caption-text">Thankful Agent Assist. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Thankful</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is the latest to go after customer service, an area that is also attracting venture capital and M&amp;A. For example, in the past few months, companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/sanas-aims-to-convert-one-accent-to-another-in-real-time-for-smoother-customer-service-calls/">Sanas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/zendesk-acquires-ai-automation-startup-cleverly-to-advance-customer-service/">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/level-ai-lands-13m-series-a-to-build-conversational-intelligence-for-customer-service/">Level AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/goodcall-picks-up-4m-yelp-partnership-to-answer-merchant-inbound-calls/">Goodcall</a> have made news.</p>
<p>Robey Miller, partner at Alpha Edison, said Thankful was an attractive investment because of the company&#8217;s focus on the post-purchase environment. Much of the data in this area is unstructured, so it is hard for brands to track it in a structured way.</p>
<p>“Thankful provides a tool set instrumental in customer service in a way that has never been available in the past,” he added. “Traditionally, this area was measured by rudimentary metrics, and we think Thankful’s technology makes sense of the data exhaust to allow you to understand how customer service drives or changes outcomes.”</p>
<p>Miller believes that Thankful is well positioned to be at the forefront of experimenting and pushing the envelope with customer service as brands seek out tools that are insightful, actionable and something that they can trust.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mico intends to use the new funding to add more engineering talent as it expands its product line. The company is also planning to go into other verticals like finance, insurance and healthcare in coming years.</p>
<p>Thankful charges customers based on volume of tickets and which product they are using. However, the company doesn’t just sell the software, but enables customers to see it working before buying it. Thankful agents listen in on a potential customer’s help desk for a couple of weeks to determine the brand’s state of customer service and what could be learned with the data.</p>
<p>“The next step for us is getting the data to the point of showing how your customer service operates — how to recognize patterns and help the brand improve,” Mico said. “This is valuable information that is typically lost. Without the data, your business becomes an opinion-based business. We are trying to shine a light on that data.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Aria and Rebecca have a lot to share this week, so I&#8217;ll keep my intro short. I want to direct your attention to my latest <a href="http://www.autonocast.com/blog/2021/9/22/236-ntsb-chair-jennifer-homendy">podcast episode</a> over at The Autonocast. Myself, along with co-hosts Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer, talk with recently-confirmed NTSB Chair <strong>Jennifer Homendy</strong> about automotive safety and what the wave of what she calls &#8220;partial automation&#8221; features in vehicles means for the industry and the consumer.</p>
<p>The episode has garnered a lot of attention — some of it negative — because of our discussion about Tesla and the FSD software beta rolling out to owners. That&#8217;s an important issue considering that on Friday Tesla released a software update that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/25/tesla-drivers-can-request-fsd-beta-with-a-button-press-despite-safety-concerns.html">allows owners to request access</a> to its Full Self-Driving Beta program. As I reported last week, drivers who get a high safety score from Tesla will get access. (This is happening as studies, like this newly released one conducted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/mit-study-finds-tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-autopilot-is-activated/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology, </a>show drivers using Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system may become inattentive.)</p>
<p>However, I hope listeners of the podcast episode will take away more from the conversation. For instance, I thought some of the more interesting comments were her thoughts on how Uber ATG reacted following the fatal crash involving its self-driving vehicle in Tempe several years ago.</p>

<p>The <strong>Micromobility America</strong> (MMA) conference was held this past week, bringing together (in person no less) the top thinkers, companies and investors in the industry. Here were some of the highlights and major themes:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Product launches</h3>
<p>Both <strong>Unagi Scooters</strong> and <strong>Cowboy</strong> launched new products onstage at MMA. Unagi&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/unagis-2440-smart-scooter-includes-turn-by-turn-directions-and-gps-tracking/">high-end $2,440 smart scooter</a>, the Model Eleven, is very tech-advanced, with features like audible directions and GPS tracking powered by Google, remote kill in the case of theft and even an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) sensor. The bluetooth speakers allow riders to play their own music or podcasts as well as hear turn-by-turn directions. And since it&#8217;s an Unagi, it&#8217;s just as lightweight as you&#8217;d expect it to be, with a smooth ride on top of a dual suspension system.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m particularly interested in the ADAS system since I recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">wrote about this trend</a>. The company says it&#8217;s the first two-wheeled device in the world with an integrated ADAS system that detects objects in the periphery and warns of impending collisions or dangers with audio and visual on the display. Users can disable it if they choose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unagi chose to build these sensors into the scooter because improving safety is a big priority and crucial to the future of micromobility as a category that can replace cars in cities,&#8221; a spokesperson from Unagi told TechCrunch. &#8220;Unagi is aiming to leverage future technologies to eventually control motor and brake, but for now, the ADAS only warns of collisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the Model Eleven is pretty pricey for a scooter, a financing option will be available once it launches, and Unagi&#8217;s subscription model will become available down the line, according to the company.</p>
<p>Cowboy&#8217;s launch of its slim-looking Cowboy 4 was also talk of the town at MMA. Customers have the option of choosing the aluminum frame to be step-through, which instantly makes it more accessible. An integrated &#8220;cockpit&#8221; is exclusively available on the C4, which is basically a built-in Quad Lock to securely mount a smartphone so the rider can access real-time information like GPS or fitness data through the Cowboy app. Once docked, phones can actually be charged using the bike&#8217;s internal battery.</p>
<p>The C4 ebike can travel up to 20 miles per hour in the United States (they&#8217;re restricted to 15 mph in the UK and Europe) and ride for about 43 miles on a single charge. It&#8217;s not the fastest bike or best battery on the market, but she is a beauty. Along with this launch, Cowboy has also pointed to its large and ever expanding network of mobile ambassadors offering free repairs across seven countries, with nationwide coverage in Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and The Netherlands.</p>
<h3>Micromobility moves beyond scooters and bikes</h3>
<p>&#8220;We have a huge variety of products and form factors now,&#8221; Horace Dediu, an analyst, one of the hosts of MMA and the person who coined the term &#8216;micromobility,&#8217; told TechCrunch. &#8220;We have everything from monowheels like OneWheel, scooters with two wheels and three wheels. We have Arcimoto, we have bikes, we have motorcycles. We even have a very small automobile that&#8217;s basically a car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s what micromobility is all about,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just one thing, one form factor. We need more kinds of form factors and there&#8217;s more coming. It feels like the eraly days of the personal computer or mobile phone era. Experiments are running and startups are trying things out, so it&#8217;s super exciting.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Coming out of the pandemic swinging</h3>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic actually really helped everybody to rethink their business model and make sure they focus on the efficiencies, so the mindset coming out of the pandemic is that it beat a lot of sense into people that you really have to run a sustainable business,&#8221; Tony Ho, VP of global business development at Segway-Ninebot, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Almost everybody here sees us coming out of the pandemic very strong, that&#8217;s the general feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>One way that feeling is manifesting for micromobility operators is in taking a look at cost of ownership and operational efficiencies, says Ho. Labor for charging vehicles and maintaining them is a huge part of getting the unit economics right, which is why we&#8217;re seeing a range of different tech working to address the problem and help operators run their fleets better, from scooters that you can summon to you or that can be teleoperated to move out of the way to scooters that have cameras built in to ensure safe rider behavior.</p>
<h3>Reframing micromobility</h3>
<p>When <strong>Ed Neidermeyer</strong>, director of communication of <strong>Partners for Automated Vehicle Educatio</strong>n and co-host with our own Kirsten Korosec on the <a href="http://www.autonocast.com/">Autonocast podcast</a>, first attended the MMA event two years ago, it was mostly a bubble of VCs, hardware startups and sharing companies. The public sector did not make much of an appearance, and it was probably still annoyed with companies for doing the VC thing and blitz-scaling to the point of annoyance and public hazard. Now, there&#8217;s been a systemic, cultural shift, which was reflected in the attendance at the event, says Neidermeyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that you had a presidential candidate (Andrew Yang) as a keynote speaker gives the event a cultural positioning and helps you frame it as, this is not just companies selling a device,&#8221; Neidermeyer told TechCrunch. &#8220;[Yang&#8217;s] presence effectively reflected this sort of broader reframing of micromobility as a system or as an alternate vision for mobility in cities.I think the space has matured a lot. There&#8217;s a lot less of that kind of VC bubble feel and much more like, how do we have a long term conversation about this.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Working together</h3>
<p>Shared micromobility operators were onstage celebrating how much ridership has increased post-Covid due to the reduction of public transit use. Jesse Fittipaldi, chief strategy officer at compact electric utility vehicle company Arcimoto, said when micromobility first appeared on the scene, there were a lot of skeptics. Now that it&#8217;s become more mainstream, companies are seeing their numbers increase in ways they never thought would happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think hope is alive,&#8221; Fittipaldi told TechCrunch. &#8220;I think that the people need to be educated right now, and there are people here working to do that. The legislators, operators, venture capitalists and the banks, the software developers, all of the things that actually make these systems work &#8212; I see them here. I see them learning and transferring knowledge, and that&#8217;s key for where we are right now.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Others news from the week &#8230;</strong></p>
<h3>Bird integrates local operators into the app</h3>
<p>Shared micromobility operator <strong>Bird</strong> announced the integration of local bikeshare providers into the Bird app so that multiple multimodal mobility options can all be seen in one place. The integration, which utilizes a General Bikeshare Feed Specification, an open source feed for public bikeshare companies, is now live in Oslo, Austin, Los Angeles, San Antonio and Milwaukee. Featured operators include <a href="https://oslobysykkel.no/en">Oslo City Bike</a>, <a href="https://austin.bcycle.com/">Metrobike Austin</a>, <a href="https://bikeshare.metro.net/">Metro Bike</a>, <a href="https://sanantonio.bcycle.com/">SA Bikeshare</a> and <a href="https://bublrbikes.org/">Bublr Bikes Milwaukee</a>.</p>
<p>The launch is part of Bird&#8217;s<a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-unveils-new-smart-bikeshare-program-designed-multimodal-cities/"> Smart Bikeshare Program</a> first announced in June when the company also announced its new shared e-bikes. The integration allows more visibility for local operators and is completely cost free to them and to cities. Riders searching for vehicles in the Bird app will also be able to see nearby public bike stations with available bikes, and they can tap the icon to be taken to the local app to start the rental process.</p>

<h3>Fresh funds</h3>
<p>New Zealand-based electric utility bike company <strong>Ubco</strong> announced an additional <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/electric-utility-bike-company-ubco-scores-10m-strategic-investment-with-tpk/">$10 million investment</a> from TPK Holdings, a previous investor who will now be leading the startup&#8217;s Series B. As part of the strategic investment, TPK, a Taiwanese electric components manufacturing company, will use its vast network to help Ubco secure parts and supplies for its flagship 2X2 bike more easily and cheaply. In the future, TPK will provide dedicated manufacturing support for Ubco&#8217;s new FRX1, a recreational off-road bike, and a four wheel utility vehicle.</p>
<p>Smart commercial scooter and bike parking and charging provider <strong>Bikeep</strong> closed a $3 million investment round which it will use to build up a partnership network with local companies to bring Bikeep stations to cities in the U.S., according to the company. British Columbia&#8217;s TransLink provides an example of what Bikeep looks like in the real world. It&#8217;s got smart locking systems as well as Bikeep&#8217;s IoT to create an on-demand bike locker program where cyclists can buy daily or monthly passes through the app.</p>
<h3>Quadricycles, coming to a city near you</h3>
<p><strong>Eli Electric Vehicles</strong>, a compact EV manufacturer, has announced the start of production of its flagship Eli Zero. It&#8217;s a tiny wee thing, made in the quadricycle fashion, complete with two seats and about 160 liters worth of storage in the trunk. The plan is to roll out small batches of the small electric vehicle across 10 European countries over the next few months. Starting price is about $11,999.</p>
<h3>New two-wheel swag</h3>
<p><strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong>, one of the most well-funded e-bike companies in North America, unveiled the RadCity 5 Plus, the next generation of its commuter ebike. The bike has a bit of an upgrade on its last model, with the ability to climb hills 40% faster and 11% more range. The more range is due to the new tires which include hydraulic disc brakes and longer-lasting ceramic pads for more stopping power and control. The bike also has a high-step and a step-thru frame and can accommodate riders from 4&#8217;8&#8243; to 6&#8217;5&#8243;. It&#8217;s available for <a href="https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radcity-plus-electric-commuter-bike">pre-order online</a> now in the U.S. and Canada for $1,799 and will be coming to Europe in the winter.</p>
<p>The founders of London-based e-bike company <strong>Analog Motion</strong> have launched a new brand of e-bikes called nothng (intentional lowercase and spelling error). The bike&#8217;s whole shtick is that less is more. The minimalist bike is an electric fixie that does come with head and tail lights, at least, but is generally going for fewer parts and less maintenance. It can reach a top speed of 20 miles per hour in the U.S., 16 miles per hour in Europe. The company is funding the bike with Indiegogo, and has already reached <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/nothng-an-electric-bike#/">559% of its funding goal</a>. Assuming the bike makes it to production, backers who have paid the £905 ($1,233) pre-order price should get their bikes by Spring 2022. By the way, that £905 is apparently 40% off the recommended retail price, which means when it comes to market this very simple bike will end up costing around £1,500 ($2,050).</p>
<p><strong>Harley Davidson&#8217;s</strong> bike arm, <a href="http://www.serial1.com/">Serial 1</a>, is selling a limited edition of its first e-bike, the MOSH/TRIBUTE. It&#8217;s a vintage prototype that pays homage to HD&#8217;s Americana vibes, but it&#8217;s got all the tech you&#8217;d expect from a bike being released in 2021, including a powerful motor that reaches top speeds of 20 miles per hour and a removable, semi-integrated battery that can go up to 105 miles. Serial 1 is just releasing 650 units, half in the U.S. and half in Europe, with delivery expected for late Q4 this year.</p>
<p><strong>Specialized</strong> has introduced its next-gen e-bikes, the Turbo Vado, Turbo Como and Turbo Tero. The bikes are meant to be smooth and comfortable, with the ability to improve functionality over time via over-the-air software updates and tech that addresses safety and theft specifically. The <a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/turbo-vado">Vado 5.0</a> is ideal for city riders. The <a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/turbo-como">Como 5.0</a> has a comfortable step-through design and an upright position for more comfort. It&#8217;s available for pre-order. And the <a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/turbo-tero">Tero 5.0</a> is built for all-terrain exploration and utility trips. All three bikes cost $5,000.</p>
<p>Early stage NYC-based <strong>Pave Motors</strong> has announced its <a href="https://www.pavemotors.com/">Pave Bike</a>, an e-moped that has the look and feel of an e-bike (kind of) with the small engine of motorcycle, is available for pre-order. The company recently successfully sold a limited supply of a first batch, and now is gearing up for more production. But this isn&#8217;t just any bike, folks. Apparently, Pave Bikes are connected to a private blockchain network that &#8220;enhances security by leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to unlock the Pave Bike, and enables secure sharing through smart rental contracts,&#8221; according to Pave.</p>
<p>Each rider gets an NFT which they can access on the Pave+ app that gives them access to their bike without an internet connection. This also lets users share their bikes with friends or as a side hustle for payment. Neat, huh? The moped itself can hit a max speed of 30 miles per hour and offers 50 miles of range per charge. Pricing starts at $3,900 or $108 per month, and pre-orders can be submitted with a $100 deposit. The moped is expected to begin shipping at the start of next year.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not one giant deal that I want to flag this week; it&#8217;s a collection of them — all which are in the delivery and logistics sectors. The deal-making in these related industries has been fast and furious. Every week I think out loud: this surely is the end of this trend, right? Nope.</p>
<p>Take this week as an example. <strong>DoorDash</strong> led a fundraising round in Berlin-based grocery delivery startup <strong>Flink SE</strong> with a pre-money valuation of $2.1 billion, according to sources <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/doordash-said-to-lead-round-in-flink-at-2-1-billion-valuation?sref=gni836kR">cited by Bloomberg</a>. The round is apparently several hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/delivery-hero-is-said-to-invest-in-gorillas-at-3-billion-value?sref=gni836kR">another scoop from Bloomberg</a>, news leaked that German food delivery company <strong>Delivery Hero</strong> plans to invest close to $200 million in grocery startup Gorillas Technologies as part of a $1 billion funding round. That new financing will value Gorillas at about $3 billion after the deal is closed. DoorDash was reportedly negotiating an investment earlier this summer with Gorillas, however those talks eventually broke down.</p>
<p>And then there is <strong>Best</strong>, the Chinese logistics company backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., that is considering a sale of its express delivery business. The company reportedly is seeking a valuation of as much as $1 billion for the business. Oh, and how can I forget, <strong>Project44</strong>, a real-time supply chain visibility company acquired last-mile tech platform <strong>Convey</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/project44-acquires-convey-for-225m-to-provide-end-to-end-supply-chain-visibility/">for $255 million</a>. Together, the two companies will combine forces to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility, from the raw materials to the front door.</p>
<p>Sprinkled amongst these mega deals were smaller raises for same-day delivery and logistics companies, including a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/last-mile-logistics-platform-cargamos-raises-11m-seed-round-to-expand-same-day-delivery/"> $7 million investment</a> into Mexico City-based last-mile logistics platform <strong>Cargamos</strong> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/londons-jiffy-scoops-28m-for-speedy-grocery-delivery/">$28 million round</a> backing <strong>Jiffy</strong>, the London grocery delivery upstart that operates a network of dark stores to do fulfillment.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Battery Resourcers</strong>, a startup that&#8217;s developing a closed-loop approach to lithium-ion battery materials, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/battery-resourcers-raises-70m-to-grow-closed-loop-battery-supply-chain/">raised $70 million</a> in mid-round funding that included participation from new investor Hitachi Ventures, as well as existing investors Orbia Ventures, Jaguar Land Rover&#8217;s InMotion Ventures, Doral Energy, At One Ventures, TDK Ventures and Trumpf Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Cars24,</strong> a site and app that sells users cars and used two-wheeled motorbikes, has raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/19/indias-cars24-a-used-vehicle-marketplace-raises-450m-at-a-1-84b-valuation/"> $450 million</a> in a Series F round comprised of $340 million and $110 million in debt. The investment values Cars24 at $1.84 billion post-money, the company said, making it one of the more valuable privately held used car startups globally. DST Global, Falcon Edge and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 co-led the Series F, with Tencent and existing investors Moore Strategic Ventures and Exor Seeds also participating. The debt round came from a mix of financial institutions.</p>
<p><strong>CDK Global</strong>, an automotive retail technology company, agreed to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210923005080/en/CDK-Global-to-Acquire-Insurance-Technology-Platform-Salty-Dot-Inc.">acquire insurance platform company </a><strong>Salty Dot</strong>. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p><strong>Daiwa Securities Group Daiwa PI Partners Co.</strong> <a href="https://ysroad.co.jp/news/press20210921/">has acquired</a> Tokyo-based bike retailer <strong>Y International</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>General Motors</strong> said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/gm-invests-300m-in-chinas-first-self-driving-car-unicorn-momenta/">will invest $300 million</a> into Chinese autonomous driving startup Momenta to accelerate the development of AV tech for future GM vehicles in China. The news comes less than six months after Momenta closed a nearly $500 million funding round, which saw participation from SAIC, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz AG and Bosch. As TechCrunch&#8217;s Rita Liao has noted in the past, &#8220;mega-fundraising has become common in the capital-intensive autonomous vehicle world.&#8221; But it appears that the startup is moving closer to commercialization as it aims to mass-produce cars equipped with its software by the end of this year.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Ox</strong>, the San Francisco Bay Area-based autonomous farming startup, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/robotic-farming-firm-iron-ox-raises-53m/">$53 million</a> in a Series C led by <strong>Breakthrough Energy Ventures</strong>, brings the firm&#8217;s total funding up to $98 million.</p>
<p><strong>Just Insure</strong>, a pay-per-mile insurance technology company, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/just-insure-raises-8m/">raised $8 million in a funding round</a> co-led by CrossCut Ventures, ManchesterStory and Western Technology Investments. The company has raised $15.3 million since its January 2019 inception.</p>
<p><strong>Kavak</strong>, a Mexico City-based startup that operates a pre-owned car marketplace in Latin America, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/mexicos-kavak-raises-700m-for-its-used-car-marketplace-doubling-its-valuation-to-8-7b/">raised $700 million</a> in a Series E round led by General Catalyst that more than doubles the company&#8217;s valuation to $8.7 billion. Tiger Global, Spruce House, D1, SEA, Founders Fund, Ribbit Capital, SoftBank and others also participated in the latest financing.</p>
<p>This comes just five months after Kavak raised $485 million in a Series D at a $4 billion valuation. The investment also marks the second time this year that Kavak has doubled its valuation. Kavak is now the second most valuable startup in all of Latin America &#8212; the first being Brazilian fintech Nubank, which earlier this year was valued at $30 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> agreed to take a <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51443331&amp;ls=L2VuL2luc3RhbmNlL2tvLnhodG1sP29pZD00ODM2MjU4">33% stake</a> in battery cell manufacturer Automotive Cells Company. The automaker is now an equal shareholder alongside Stellantis and TotalEnergies. The move will help Mercedes reach its electric only portfolio target, which it has said will require a total battery production capacity of more than 200 Gigawatt hours by the end of the decade.</p>
<p><strong>National Express</strong> is in talks to buy rival Stagecoach in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/21/national-express-buy-stagecoach-bus-company">an all-share deal</a> that would combine the UK&#8217;s biggest coach and bus operators, The Guardian reported. The agreement would value Stagecoach at about £445 million ($608.9 million), a 18% premium on the closing price of the company&#8217;s shares on Monday when the deal was announced.</p>
<p><strong>Spotnana</strong>, software-as-a-service platform for travel buyers and suppliers, emerged from stealth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/travel-technology-platform-spotnana-launches-with-41m/">with $41 million</a> in its pocket and an open global platform targeting the $1.4 trillion business travel industry. Its funding includes a $34 million Series A, co-led by ICONIQ and Madrona Venture Group with participation from Decibel and Mubadala Capital, and a previous undisclosed $7 million seed round from 2020, also from ICONIQ and Madrona and including 8VC and Global Founders Capital.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner. We&#8217;ve got a lot to get to today, so let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<p>First, the chip shortage that&#8217;s held multiple industries by the throat for the past 18 months is continuing unabated. Consulting firm <strong>AlixPartners</strong> forecast this week that the shortage will cost the automotive industry $210 billion in this year alone &#8212; that&#8217;s up from the firm&#8217;s mid-year estimation of $110 billion.</p>
<p>In response to the ongoing supply chain squeeze, the <strong>White House</strong> held its second summit with companies in the semiconductor market (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/biden-white-house-semiconductor-summit/">TechCrunch covered the first meeting</a>), including <strong>Ford</strong>, <strong>Stellantis</strong>, <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</strong>, <strong>General Motors</strong>, <strong>Intel</strong>, and <strong>Apple</strong>. While it&#8217;s unclear what exactly came out of the meeting, it was likely another information-sharing session, both between industry and government and also between industry players, especially the manufacturers of chips and their customers.</p>
<p>Press Secretary <strong>Jen Psaki</strong> told reporters in advance of the meeting Thursday that Biden&#8217;s administration would continue to press for Congress to pass legislation to strengthen domestic manufacturing capacity for chips. There&#8217;s currently a bill in the House, the Chips for America Act, that would earmark $52 billion to shore up such capacity, but no action has yet been taken on it.</p>
<hr />
<p>In other news, let&#8217;s talk autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. Spoiler alert: they&#8217;re not the same thing! Tech industry policy coalition <strong>Chamber of Progress</strong> recently questioned Senator Dianne Feinstein&#8217;s (D-CA) recent conflation of the two technologies <a href="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/d/6/d6c67271-333b-42d4-b224-0f5e0e5ac520/FE4F312C863205F66A7E6DD2A2E9F275.av-letter-to-nhtsa.pdf">in a lette</a>r to the <strong>National Highway Transportation Safety Administration</strong> criticizing Tesla&#8217;s marketing of &#8220;Full Self Driving.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ariel Wolf</strong>, general counsel at the special interest group<strong> Self Driving Coalition</strong>, told Policy Corner in a recent interview that the group also continues to see ADAS and AVs being conflated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s damaging the public&#8217;s understanding of the two distinct technologies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no question that that&#8217;s occurring, and it&#8217;s starting to bleed over and it&#8217;s creating this safety risk. In a very real sense it&#8217;s creating this safety risk because that conflation leads people to misuse the ADAS. But certainly it jeopardizes the future of AVs, because the public then looks at ADAS failures and targets AVs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Self Driving Coalition, along with over a dozen other groups including <strong>Alliance for Automotive Innovation</strong>, sent their own letter &#8212; to <strong>Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg</strong>, urging the <strong>Department of Transportation</strong> to implement regulations and a framework for the safe deployment of AVs. Wolf said some of the biggest question marks include: creating a predictable timeline around caps on the number of AV models that can receive regulatory exemption from certain federal motor vehicle standards (these exemptions allow AV developers to test their vehicles in real-world environments); and how the Department plans to address novel vehicle designs.</p>
<p><strong>Other pieces of news this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>California Governor <strong>Gavin Newsom</strong> signed into law a bill that will require all AVs to be electric by 2030. AV developers <strong>Cruise</strong>, <strong>Nuro</strong>, and <strong>Zoox</strong>, along with the <strong>Union of Concerned Scientists</strong>, each came out in favor of the bill. Rebecca Bellan gives a good summary of the legislation, and its stakes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/california-bill-would-require-all-self-driving-vehicles-to-be-zero-emission-by-2025/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The German environmental NGO <strong>Deutsche Umwelthilfe</strong> filed a lawsuit against <strong>Daimler</strong> and <strong>BMW</strong>, alleging that the two automakers are not doing enough to curb carbon emissions by the end of the decade. The news was first reported by the German newspaper Handelsblatt. This case is notable for two reasons: one, it&#8217;s an example of private citizens bringing a climate change lawsuit against a company; and two, it will require the two automakers to show that they are doing everything they can to meet Germany&#8217;s statutory climate targets.</p>

<h3>People news</h3>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong> co-founder, president and CTO Kyle Vogt has been appointed to the board of Upside Foods, a cell-cultured meat company.

The entrepreneur is an advocate for a plant-based diet and was <a href="https://twitter.com/kvogt/status/1287915475066789890?lang=en">behind the launch</a> of a restaurant called BAIA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The meteoric rise of collaborative design startup Canva &#8212; now valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 billion</a> &#8212; and conversely, the viral interest we&#8217;ve been seeing in the market for NFTs where you can &#8220;buy&#8221; a share of a limited-edition digital asset, are two examples of how the tech world today revolves around &#8212; and values &#8212; catchy ways of engaging with visual media online. Today, another startup that&#8217;s built a business around tackling the same concept &#8212; as it applies specifically to brand management for organizations &#8212; is announcing some funding as it finds some traction of its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frontify</a>, which provides a cloud-based platform for businesses to centralize and distribute all of their brand assets to those who work in and with their companies, has closed an equity round of $50 million, funding that the Swiss startup (based out of St Gallen) will be using both to invest in building out its technology, as well as to move deeper into new markets like the U.S.</p>
<p>Revaia (the VC formerly known as Gaia Capital Partners) led the round with new backer High Sage Ventures and previous backers EQT Ventures, Blossom Capital, and Tenderloin Ventures also participating. EQT led the company&#8217;s previous round of $22.3 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/frontify-raises-22-3m-to-help-businesses-manage-how-their-brands-and-logos-get-used/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2020</a>.</p>
<p>That last round was just ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic going global, and as with other tech companies built on the concepts of distributed, cloud-based and remote work, that disaster ironically turned out to work in Frontify&#8217;s favor: the company picked up some 300 customers as the pandemic hit. It now has 5,000 customers in total.</p>
<p>For some context on that number and the startup&#8217;s growth, in January 2020 it had around 2,500 organizations were already using the Frontify platform &#8212; companies it discloses publicly include Facebook, Pepsi, Lufthansa, Sennheiser and Vodafone.</p>
<p>Frontify&#8217;s platform today provides a repository for companies to manage and distribute brand assets used both in-house and by external partners. But what is notable about it &#8212; and what sets it apart from a number of other companies providing digital asset management tools (others in same space include Bynder and Canto) &#8212; is that it covers not just digital media files but how they can be and are getting used.</p>
<p>In other words, Frontify is not just a storage folder for fonts and logos, but focuses a lot of its business on being a wider collaboration suite that tracks usage, and the status of projects where those assets are appearing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In areas like digital advertising, for example, it allows companies to create templates that lock in certain design details so that they can remain consistent as a company looks to create multiple versions of one piece of artwork for a larger campaign, and critically it&#8217;s set up to allow for this kind of work in a distribute way, by design, which is one reason why it has gained a foothold in the current market, where teams that might have previously been centralized are now working in as distributed a way as they used to work with external partners.</p>
<p>All of this can be used via the web or <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/frontify-launches-the-first-desktop-app-for-company-brand-content-301181306.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desktop app</a>, and <a href="https://www.frontify.com/en/developer-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers can build their own templates</a> and other use cases on top of its platform.</p>
<p>The bigger picture for digital media online is a rapidly changing one. NFTs may or may not end up being a speculative flash in the pan, the Twenties&#8217; answer to Tulipmania, but they have put a strong focus on how the market wants and strives to &#8220;control&#8221; visual artifacts. Canva, meanwhile, is at the other end of the spectrum, a huge respository for designing and sharing work that will live in the digital world. Frontify has essentially created a B2B platform that lives in the same realm: it has identified the value of the asset, and the value in being able to collaborate with it in a way that lines up with an organization&#8217;s wider design goals.</p>
<p>And in keeping with the concept of design consistency, this is very much in line with how Frontify has seen itself from the start. As Roger Dudler, Frontify&#8217;s CEO and founder, described to me back in January 2020, “We think design tools might change rather quickly [while] the single source of truth for all brand resources will stay,” he said. “That’s why we bridge that gap by integrating with as many existing tools as possible.” He described the templating features that the company created to expand beyond basic digital asset management as tools to “bring Canva-like functionality to brands with a much more targeted offering for complex enterprise needs.” (Frontify integrates with all of the standard software used in the design industry, including Figma, Sketch and Adobe XD.)</p>
<p>“We instantly got excited about <span class="il">Frontify</span>’s brand management platform and its capacity to capture the whole branding process in one place, making it the single source of truth for employees and collaborators,” said Elina Berrebi, Founding Partner of Revaia, in a statement. “They have demonstrated their ability to convince some of the most trusted brands globally in all industries, while delivering strong and efficient revenue growth. We’re also buying into the passion and the people at <span class="il">Frontify</span>, and are thrilled to contribute to building its global leadership.”</p>
<p>The company is not disclosing its valuation, but we have asked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish electric motorcycle manufacturer Cake has announced the close of a $60 million Series B that the company will use to help set up manufacturing facilities in Europe, North America and Asia, as well as scale up its retail capabilities.</p>
<p>“We are in the process of implementing initiatives to scale the business, structuring and laying the base for rapid growth,&#8221; said Stefan Ytterborn, founder and CEO of Cake, in a statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/electric-motorbike-company-cake-launches-the-makka-an-e-moped-for-city-riding-at-3500/">Cake recently launched the Makka</a>, an electric moped for city riding, which demonstrates a shift in direction of Cake&#8217;s product platforms. Its first two vehicles,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/cake-brings-a-swedish-take-on-e-motorcycle-design-to-the-u-s/"> the Kalk</a> and the Ösa, are made for heavier duty, off-road riding and utility, so the Makka has helped to expand Cake&#8217;s user base within B2C and B2B, says Ytterborn.</p>
<p>The new manufacturing facilities across three continents will help Cake be more sustainable and efficient as it aims to ship its vehicles direct-to-consumer worldwide, according to the company. Until recently, the bikes were only assembled in Taiwan and shipped to warehouses in the U.S., Canada and Europe or directly to customers in  Australasia. Each shipping container from Taiwan could fit 25 bikes. Now, Cake can ship enough components from Taiwan to its European or North American facilities to equal 150 bikes per container, reducing shipping volume by more than 80%, a Cake spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The European assembly has been up and running since July, and the company aims to have North American assembly begin in the first half of next year, according to the company.</p>
<div>&#8220;Efficiency wise we will be able to assemble an order with two weeks delivery time instead of ordering eight months beforehand, reflecting what anticipated demand will be: high inventory risk and cash flow heavy,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</div>
<p>With the fresh funding, Cake will also begin to set up a retail presence, with showrooms popping up in major cities beginning this fall, says Ytterborn.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we were entering a space with increasingly strong tailwinds when we got started back in 2016, but we couldn&#8217;t dream of the pace in which things are now happening, for the good of people, planet and business,&#8221; he continued.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round consists of convertible notes of $14 million and a $46 million financing round. The latter was led by Swedish pension fund AMF, according to Cake. A handful of new investors also participated in the round, as well as existing stakeholders, Creandum and Headline, two VCs that participated in Cake&#8217;s $14 million Series A in 2019.</p>
<p>“Cake&#8217;s obsession with creating a superior user experience has been ingrained in the company&#8217;s DNA from day one and is something we can fully identify with,&#8221; said Staffan Helgesson, general partner at Creandum Advisor, in a statement. &#8220;We are very happy to continue to support the team for the long term in their ambition to become the category leader in the premium two wheeler electric vehicle segment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish electric vehicle maker Polestar reched an agreement to go public via special purpose acquisition with Gores Guggenheim Inc., The SPAC deal would give Polestar a valuation of $20 billion.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gores-guggenheim-spac-nears-deal-to-combine-with-polestar-11632694281">Wall Street Journal</a> reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the deal, that the SPAC agreement was imminent. TechCrunch has updated the article to reflect information in the official announcement. Once the merger closes, the combined company will be held by a new public company  named Polestar Automotive Holding UK Limited. The company is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol &#8220;PSNY.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polestar falls under Volvo Car Group&#8217;s electric performance brand, but both Polestar and Volvo are owned by Chinese car maker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.</p>
<p>With this announcement, Polestar joins a hoard of other EV and EV-related companies to go SPAC over the last two years, including Arrival, Nikola, EVgo, Proterra, Lucid Motors, Bird and many more.</p>
<p>Polestar aims to create a life cycle assessment framework for the electric car manufacturing industry, one in which the entire manufacturing, sales and end-of-life process is so transparent and traceable that the company can create <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/polestar-will-have-to-question-everything-in-order-to-build-the-first-climate-neutral-ev/">carbon-neutral vehicles</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/polestar-to-build-its-first-all-electric-suv-in-the-united-states/">The automaker announced its plans in June</a> to manufacture its first SUV, the Polestar 3, in the United States, production of which is expected to begin globally in 2022. High quality parts and a manufacturing facility in the States are not cheap endeavors. If the reports are true, going public might be a way for Polestar to get the funds needed to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>The deal would also help the automaker get to market in the U.S. faster so Polestar could compete with Tesla. The automaker has positioned its Polestar 2, a sedan, as a better car than the Tesla, but it&#8217;ll need the capital in order to make it the same sort of household name in the EV industry, and one that&#8217;s trustworthy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ascendcorp.com/">Ascend Money</a>, the Thailand-based fintech startup behind TrueMoney, an e-wallet service, announced today it has raised a $150 million Series C round at a valuation of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The Series C round was led by <a href="https://www.cpgroupglobal.com/">Charoen Pokphand Group</a>, which is a major shareholder of Ascend Money, with participation from <a href="https://bowwavecap.com/">Bow Wave Capital Management</a> and returning backer <a href="https://www.antgroup.com/en">Ant Group</a>.</p>
<p>Ascend Money will use the proceeds to grow its e-wallet application – TrueMoney Wallet – and expand its digital financial services ranging from digital lending and digital investment to cross border remittances in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2013, also continues to strengthen its global operations across six countries &#8212; Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Since the coronavirus outbreak, e-payments via TrueMoney Wallet have grown exponentially because of social distancing measures and growing public awareness of contactless transactions across the region, Tanyapong Thamavaranukupt, co-President of Ascend Money told TechCrunch. Its users in Thailand have grown from 17 million in early 2021 to 20 million as of now, while the transactions of its online payment use case surged over 75%, Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>“The growth in e-payment suggests changing consumers’ spending habits as Southeast Asia moves toward a digital economy and a cashless society,” Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>“The pandemic’s disruptive effects have accelerated the growth of the digital economy across Southeast Asia,” Itai Lemberger, founder and CEO of Bow Wave Capital Management said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its total payment volume stood at $14 billion in 2020 across the six countries in Southeast Asia, representing 84% growth between 2019 and 2020, according to its statement. About 70% came from Thailand while 30% came from the international market, the co-President Thamavaranukupt said. In Thailand, Ascend Money has about 70% of market share based on its own research, Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>Ascend Money tells TechCrunch it has amassed a total of 50 million users so far through TrueMoney and offline channels including approximately 88,000 TrueMoney agent networks, which is its core strength for regional expansion.</p>
<p>The e-wallet service also serves as a payment channel for B2B, ranging from big brands to local SME owners as well as street market entrepreneurs. TrueMoney Wallet platform provides digital loans service to the customers including small business entrepreneurs, who don’t have traditional credit scores to access the digital loans, along with the payment service, Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>“Apart from e-wallet, we are an agent-based payment and remittance service provider. Since last year, we’ve also rolled out TrueMoney Wallet for agent [networks] and migrated our offline agent to the online platform, which would help enhance and digitize their operations,” Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>True Money agents are local entrepreneurs, who registered with Ascend Money to earn additional income by being their agents to provide services like bill payment, phone top-up and domestic and cross-border remittance services, he explained.</p>
<p>“We provide TrueMoney Wallet and the TrueMoney Agent service in some other countries outside Thailand. Most users are unbanked and the underbanked population with limited access to basic financial services,” Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>“Ascend Money provides a financial platform of opportunity for those financially excluded as well as SMEs around the region. The company’s success is also a testament to Thailand’s capability and strong ecosystem to support domestic fintech firms and startups for overseas expansion,” Ascend Money founder and chairman of the board Suphachai Chearavanont said.</p>
<p>Last year, Ascend Money opened a service for expatriates like Myanmarese and Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand, enabling them to register on TrueMoney Wallet and transfer money to their family in the homeland, Thamavaranukupt said.</p>
<p>Ascend Money considers going public after hitting $1.5 billion of its valuation, co-President Monsinee Nakapanant told TechCrunch without providing exact timeline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">After working as an investment banker in Canada for a decade, Halima Iqbal moved back to Pakistan in 2017 and quickly realized how difficult it is for women to access financial services. “I had a really hard time opening up a basic bank account. It took me about three and a half months,” Iqbal told TechCrunch. She began researching how Pakistani women deal with money—for example, how do they save or take out credit?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Then she met product designer and entrepreneur Farwah Tapal, who had recently returned to Pakistan from Spain, and the two created <a href="https://www.oraan.com/">Oraan</a> in 2018 to help women access financial services. The startup announced today it has raised $3 million in funding, co-led by returning investor Zayn Capital and Wavemaker Partners, with participation from Resolution Ventures, i2i Ventures, Hustle Fund, Haitou Global, Plug and Play and angels like Claire Diaz-Ortiz, a former investing partner at Magma Partners and early Twitter employee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Oraan has now raised just over $4 million in funding. Iqbal and Tapal said they are the first women entrepreneurs in Pakistan’s fintech space to raise a seed round.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2208358" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208358" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2208358" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?w=453" alt="Oraan founders Farwah Tapal and Halima Iqbal" width="350" height="525" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Oraan.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208358" class="wp-caption-text">Oraan founders Farwah Tapal and Halima Iqbal</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">“There was an opportunity, how can we understand the saving space and informal economy in Pakistan, and where can we capture that?” Iqbal said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Oraan decided to start with ROSCAs (rotating credit and savings associations), or committees of people who contribute money to a pool that is distributed to a member each month. It will expand into more financial services, with plans to become a digital bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Based on Oraan’s research, only about 7% of Pakistani women are financially included, meaning they have at least a basic bank account. For many women, trying to access financial services means facing logistical and social barriers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">“When a woman goes into a bank, the first question we get asked is ‘why do you even need bank account?,’ especially if you’re a freelancer or micro-entrepreneur or unemployed homemaker,” Iqbal said, adding that women are often asked to provide their husband or a male relative’s information so they can serve as a guarantor. “These kinds of restrictions have hindered women from having the kind of financial mobility that they require to be able to contribute equally to the economic growth of the country.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Traditionally, ROSCAs are formed within communities, for example among family members, friends or neighbors. Then each person puts in a set amount of money per month. Who gets each month’s pool of money is decided by the committee, sometimes by a vote or random draw.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Iqbal and Tapal decided to start with ROSCAs because almost everyone they know had participated in an informal one. Based on Oraan’s research, about 41% of the Pakistani population has participated in a ROSCA and $5 billion gets rotated through them on an annual basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“The scale of use and what it provided to the user was just so fascinating,” Iqbal said. “This is a goldmine to create something valuable for the end user, as well as a business opportunity.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Oraan formalizes ROSCAs, offering five-month or ten-month plans. One of the main differences between Oraan’s ROSCAs and informal ones is that users can pick which month they want the pool of money, because the app’s treasury management backend forms committees based on members’ needs and ability to pay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">By participating in ROSCAs through Oraan, users also have the opportunity to join committees with people outside of their communities and social networks. Before accepting people onto Oraan, the app vets them, and it also manages each ROSCA, collecting and disbursing funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Generally in Pakistan, there is no concept of credit scoring and that’s why financial inclusion or access to liquidity becomes a problem,” Tapal said. Oraan partners with other providers to assess creditworthiness based on verified IDs, where users live, proof of income and personal references.</p>
<p class="p1">Some of the reasons Oraan’s users have participated in ROSCAs include financing their children’s education, paying for IVF treatments or leaving abusive relationships, Iqbal said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">As people participate in committees in Oraan, they also build a payment history, which can open the door to other financial services in the future. The startup’s ultimate goal is become an online bank, said Iqbal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“We take this culturally, religiously, socially acceptable tool, which is committees, digitize them and bring women into a more formal space where they can open bank accounts,” said Iqbal. Other verticals Oraan plans to launch include savings, credit, insurance and educational financing, as well as investment products that will allow women to save money in mutual funds and other different asset classes. It also plans to build online communities for its users.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“We want to become a full-fledged neobank and very heavily based on community because that’s where we see that women want a sense of belonging,” said Iqbal. “When it comes to financial transactions, that’s one of the things they feel they lack, that sense of belonging.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
