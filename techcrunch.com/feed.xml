										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is plenty of technology out there to help make a building more sustainable, the ability to incorporate features into its design can be easier said than done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter</span><a href="https://www.cove.tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cove.tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that wants to make sure buildings are sustainable by design from the moment of inception. The Atlanta-based startup, which has raised $30 million in a Series B round of funding led by Coatue, claims that in 2021, its software helped design and construction professionals avoid 5x more carbon than Tesla. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Downey Jr.’s FootPrint Coalition also participated in the financing, along with existing backers Mucker Capital, Urban Us and Knoll Ventures. The round was pre-emptive, according to CEO and co-founder Sandeep Ahuja, and brings the company’s total raised to $36.5 million. While she declined to reveal valuation, she did say it was up “10x” from the company’s $5.7 million raise in November of 2020.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249122" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a B2B SaaS company, cove.tool gives architects and contractors the ability to input the details of a project and its lot and get recommendations for how to optimize for daylighting, HVAC systems, solar and materials, among other things. Powered by machine learning, cove.tool is designed to give architects, engineers and contractors a way to measure a wide range of building performance metrics while reducing construction cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The whole reason why we exist is to reduce the carbon emissions within the building environment because about 40% of all carbon emissions is buildings,” Ahuja told TechCrunch. “The whole goal of cove.tool is to make the process of material selection and building simulation much, much simpler so we can allow people to pick better material alternatives that are not only low carbon, but also cost optimal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cove.tool launched the beta version of its software in August 2017. Today, more than 25,000 projects are being built using cove.tool’s software &#8212; everything from warehouses to data centers to office buildings. The software has more than 15,000 users across 30 countries, including architects, engineers, contractors and building product manufacturers such as HDR, AECOM, Skanska and Stora Enso. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Through streamlined automated analysis that helps architects, engineers, contractors and building product manufacturers use data-driven design, cove.tool is making the built world sustainable and efficient in the fight against climate change,” Ahuja said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impressively, Cove.tool says it has offset 28.5 million tons of carbon this year, the equivalent of planting and growing 450 million trees for 10 years. The startup plans to use its new capital to expand its site of products, keep adding to its 60-person team and provide carbon reduction analysis for the architecture, engineering and construction industries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahuja said the company’s core competitors are consultants that are performing similar work manually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our differentiator is the ability to democratize access to data and be able to do something in 30 minutes that once took 2-4 weeks,” she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company is not yet profitable, it could be if it stopped scaling operations, according to Ahuja.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the months to come, we will further expand our product suite, offering integrations across the AEC ecosystem, making performance data even more accessible. We see that the carbon problem is a data problem,” she told TechCrunch. “By using API frameworks we can significantly simplify the practice of analyzing building data and sharing that data with the many professionals across the building and design process, ultimately, empowering seamless collaboration and improving project outcomes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to scale its sales and marketing efforts within the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and the EU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Downey Jr., founder of FootPrint Coalition, noted that the construction and operation of buildings accounts for 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By combining energy efficiency, design and transparency for material selection cove.tool addresses this massive problem,” he wrote via email. “It’s a prime example of a scalable business that employs machine learning and principled leadership to literally build a better future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coatue Partner David Cahn said his firm believes sustainable construction is one of the most important environmental challenges today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cove’s software-driven approach has the potential to make architecture both easier and cleaner,” he wrote via email.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Gen Z isn&#8217;t satisfied with the social media they grew up with, so they&#8217;re building the apps that they want to use. A &#8220;social branding&#8221; app for creative teens and twenty-somethings, Tagg is announcing a $2 million seed round today from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, Facebook’s former VP of International Growth Ed Baker, TripAdvisor founder [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gen Z <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-files-show-growth-struggles-as-young-users-in-u-s-decline">isn&#8217;t satisfied</a> with the social media they grew up with, so they&#8217;re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/flox-an-app-to-help-friend-groups-meet-each-other-is-wooing-college-students-in-nyc/">building the apps</a> that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/blue-fever-an-anonymous-social-network-acquires-gen-z-founded-trill/">they want to use</a>. A &#8220;social branding&#8221; app for creative teens and twenty-somethings, <a href="https://www.tagg.id/">Tagg</a> is announcing a $2 million seed round today from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, Facebook’s former VP of International Growth Ed Baker, TripAdvisor founder Stephen Kaufer, Pillar VC and more.</p>
<p>Founded by recent alumni of Brown University and the neighboring Rhode Island School of Design, Tagg is still in private beta with thousands of users, and thousands more on a waitlist. It&#8217;s like a link-in-bio service, but with a social element that encourages young creatives to connect, collaborate and develop friendships.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the digital world, the more authentic your brand, the more genuine your connections. Current social platforms fall short as they were not built for this evolving intersection of branding and connecting,&#8221; the company explains. &#8220;Tagg is building and growing an environment allowing for full creative expression of oneself—no restrictions, no stigma.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Depending on what you want to use your profile for (you might want a social profile, or you might want to promote your art and network), you can choose from five profile skins when you onboard into the app. From there, you can customize your page, then follow people and post content like you would on any other app. But on Tagg, there&#8217;s no like count on posts, which is an intentional design choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;W<span style="font-weight: 400;">e do not have likes &#8212; just comments, sharing and views &#8212; because we want our creatives focused on being their favorite selves with no stigma,&#8221; co-founder Victor Loolo told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially among the Gen Z audience that Tagg is built for, users don&#8217;t always want like counts, since they know it can encourage them to compare themselves to peers in a superficial way. Even US Senators like Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">introduced legislation</a> that would ban like counts for social media users younger than 16, since it might <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">harm teens&#8217; mental health</a>.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249150" style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249150" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2249150" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?w=670" alt="" width="670" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=148,150 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=296,300 296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=768,780 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=670,680 670w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=1513,1536 1513w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/User-profile_Wunmi-copy.png?resize=96,96 96w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249150" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tagg</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tagg&#8217;s &#8220;social branding&#8221; marketing might seem counter-intuitive at first glance &#8212; the concept of branding might sound like you&#8217;re putting yourself in a box. But by design, Tagg encourages its users to grow out of their comfort zones. Even though users build their profile through using preset skins, these are only suggestions &#8212; if users want to build their profiles from a blank slate and create their own categories to organize their content with, they can do that.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Profiles can look like anything, that’s the beauty of it. We wanted to move away from the traditional, restrictive, cookie-cutter profiles that all social apps have, because as Gen Z-ers, we value freedom of expression and uniqueness a lot,&#8221; Loolo explained. &#8220;We wanted to find a happy, user-friendly medium between a traditional profile and a blank page, which would be challenging for a lot of people, so we went with profile skins.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Tagg was inspired by Loolo&#8217;s own experience as a football player at Brown, where he felt that it was difficult to define himself outside of his identity as a student athlete. That&#8217;s what inspired him to build Tagg, alongside co-founders Blessing Ubani and Sophie Chen.</p>
<p>“People are kind of put into a box. Let’s say I’m a guy who does cooking videos on TikTok &#8212; I’m the cooking video guy. But I might enjoy video games and other stuff,&#8221; Loolo told TechCrunch. &#8220;We wanted to break away from that and allow for these creatives to curate more holistic pictures of themselves.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249157" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249157" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2249157" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="298" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?resize=300,131 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?resize=768,337 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?resize=680,298 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/618ca8cf6e521f841cd10b97_phone-mockup.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249157" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tagg</p></div></p>
<p>Tagg users currently earn points by engaging with the platform &#8212; while these points are currently just a vanity feature, Loolo sees this as a potential future for the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Tagg is not currently decentralized or tokenized, the principles of our platform mirror web 3’s values,&#8221; Loolo said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our goals is to help our creatives understand that being directly rewarded for their content sharing and community participation is the solution to the issues of creator economy, as opposed to underpaying creator funds and inconsistent brand deals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In the future, Tagg could move toward allowing users to earn a coin or token with value. But for now, Tagg is focused on onboarding more users from its waitlist and acquiring more users.</p>
<p>After graduating from college in 2020, the team moved to the Bay Area, where they have continued to work on the app. With its recent funding, the app is hiring to expand its team. Recently, Steven Fang joined Tagg as a CTO and co-founder, bringing fifteen years of engineering experience.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fees on the Nubank IPO were among the lowest of the year. Could it also be a sign of some of the changes we are planning to track in 2022?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fees on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/nubank-hashicorp-provide-startup-market-with-end-of-year-ipo-wins/">Nubank IPO</a> were among the lowest of the year, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/goldman-morgan-stanley-citi-split-meager-fees-in-nubank-s-ipo">revealed</a> this week. Of the $2.6 billion the Brazilian fintech&#8217;s parent company, Nu Holdings, raised in the operation, only 1.6% are going to its underwriters, which included Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among 490 IPOs in the U.S. so far this year, only three paid a smaller percentage,&#8221; Bloomberg noted.</p>
<p>The Brazilian press was <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/pechincha-em-nova-york-nubank-pagou-menos-que-xp-bancos-para-abrir-capital-nos-eua-25320217">quick to report</a> that Nubank got itself &#8220;a bargain.&#8221; Their term, but it did indeed land a better deal than three other Brazilian fintechs that went public before it did: PagSeguro, which IPO&#8217;d on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018; StoneCo, which <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/buffett-backed-stoneco-sheds-22-billion-in-value-since-peaking">shed a lot of value</a> since its 2018 IPO; and broker XP, which went public in 2019.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>According to Bloomberg, these respectively paid 2.4%, 3.6%, and 4.3% in fees. The difference is also stark in absolute terms, with Nubank set to pay $41.6 million in commissions and discounts, compared to $83.2 million for XP.</p>

Let&#8217;s explore.</p>
<h2>Hot or not</h2>
<p>IPO fees are subject to market dynamics. But it’s not merely the total fee percentage that matters; other elements can also show a company’s market strength viz banks competing for its IPO business.</p>
<p>For example, when DoorDash went public just over a year ago, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/doordash-aims-to-add-11-billion-to-its-valuation-during-public-offering/">noted that the company</a> had “no shares set aside for its underwriting banks to buy at its IPO price.” Normally, underwriting banks get the option to purchase a block of shares at a company’s final IPO price if they so choose. This gives the banks something akin to an avenue to free profit if the company they are helping take public performs well.</p>
<p>Briefly: If underwriting banks secure access to, say, 5 million shares in an IPO, and the company prices at $20 but opens at $30, the banks can lock in a neat $50 million. Obviously, it’s more complicated than that, but illustrative math can deobfuscate.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">FedEx has received its first five GM-built electric delivery vans out of an order of 500, the company announced. The move represents an important landmark for FedEx in its stated goal to be have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fed-ex-all-electric-delivery-fleet-2040-182248046.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">all-electric delivery fleet</a> and be carbon neutral around the world by 2040.</p>
<p>&#8220;The delivery of the first BrightDrop EV600s is a historic moment, born out of a spirit of collaboration between two leading American companies,&#8221; said FedEx&#8217;s chief sustainability officer Mitch Jackson. &#8220;[T]ransforming our pickup and delivery fleet to electric vehicles is integral to achieving our ambitious sustainability goals announced earlier this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>FedEx was announced as a key customer for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-brightdrop-ev600-electric-truck-ep1-delivery-business-fedex-153325067.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Brightdrop EV600 vans</a> and has been <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/sustainability/electric-vehicles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">testing</a> Brightdrop&#8217;s electric EP1 pallets over the last while. GM, which owns Chevrolet and Cadillac, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-brightdrop-ev600-electric-truck-ep1-delivery-business-fedex-153325067.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">spun out</a> the Brightdrop business unit early this year. &#8220;The EV600 combines the best attributes of a traditional and a step-in van into one vehicle, keeping driver safety, comfort, and convenience top of mind,&#8221; said Brightdrop CEO Travis Katz. &#8220;It’s also the fastest built vehicle, from concept to market, in GM’s history.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249254" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The all-wheel-drive EV600 has 600 cubic feet of cargo space and can go up to 250 miles on a charge. Inside, drivers get a security system in the cargo area, auto-locking doors and motion-activated interior lighting. They also benefit from automatic emergency braking and parking assistance. The EP1 is a kind of trolley often found in stores an warehouses, with 23 cubic feet of space and an electric motor that makes it easier to move heavy objects.</p>
<p>The first five EV600s are being delivered to FedEx&#8217;s Express facility in Inglewood, California. To support them FedEx is building charging stations across its network of facilities, including 500 already installed across California. It&#8217;s also working with utility companies to evaluate electrical grid capacity required for its charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>While FedEx has thrown its electric delivery lot in with GM, rival UPS has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-ups-arrival-electric-trucks-order-investment.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">ordered</a> 10,000 electric <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/commercial-trucks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">delivery trucks</a> from <a href="https://arrival.com/news/ups-invests-in-arrival-and-orders-10000-generation-2-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">UK-based Arrival Ltd</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[The company includes a smart fridge that is stocked with meals and snacks daily, and a mobile app so that office employees can check out the contents whenever they want.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies get employees back into offices, startups like New York-based foodtech company <a href="http://fraiche.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fraîche</a> aims to be the brand feature that welcomes them back.</p>
<p>Today, the company, founded in 2019, announced $2 million in seed funding by backers that included La Boulange’s Pascal Rigo, Petrus Winery’s Jean Moueix, Bakerly’s Bruno and Julien Caron and the Newlab.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249139" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249139" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2249139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?w=314" alt="Fraiche" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/App-Products.PNG.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249139" class="wp-caption-text">Fraîche&#8217;s mobile app</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249137" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Fraîche (pronounced like crème fraîche), aims to bring healthier food items into workplaces. It places an auto-stocking smart fridge inside offices and teams up with eateries, like Le Botaniste, Egg Shop, Pressed, La Fermiere to provide the food. It will also offer its own private label products in the future, Tximista Lizarazu, CEO at Fraîche, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>All companies have to do is determine how much they want to subsidize per employee, and Fraîche will stock and refill the fridge everyday. Employees can also download an app to access the fridge’s contents.</p>
<p>One of Fraîche’s early investors, Romain Afflelou, co-founder of Cosmo Connected, said he liked the momentum that the company had and how it was leveraging that companies are ready to spend more money on their employees. He typically invests in companies that are connected with the world of tomorrow in terms of how people move, eat and heal.</p>
<p>“Fraîche provides all of the food options at the office, and employees can get more affordable food that is fresh and cleaner,” he added. “You can have meals Monday through Friday inside the same place and get different products each day.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, many office cafeterias shut down during the global pandemic and were unable to staff up when they could reopen, Lizarazu said. Even his own company was not immune to the effects: Fraîche initially lost all of its locations, but saw the tides turn about four months later.</p>
<p>As a result, you might think that with the Omicron variant keeping people at home a little longer, something like Fraîche would not work. However, when asked, Lizarazu said the company just needs to have 30 people in an office to make what they do work. And, if 15% to 20% of offices don’t return ever, he is still optimistic with 80% of the market remaining, he added.</p>
<p>“Companies want to make their offices a better place, want to convince people to come back,  and have more of a budget for health and wellness,” Lizarazu said. “Right now the market is shifting, and we are starting to sell more and move faster. We spent 2020 investing in technology and building the product, and now we are ready to deploy it.”</p>

<p>Though the company has only been operating for a few months, it is already seeing customers using the fridges three to four times a day to get meals and snacks. Lizarazu forecasted that companies would spend $5,000 a month, but is seeing double that.</p>
<p>Fraîche’s revenue is between $80,000 and $150,000 per machine per year, which includes servicing of the fridge and the food delivery, which he says is equivalent to what New Yorkers currently pay to order out for food and have it delivered, but in case, with less of the friction.</p>
<p>The latest round of funding gives the company $3 million in total funding. Workplaces including Tikehau Capital, Silverstein Properties, Newlab, Brooklyn Navy Yard, Ardian and Ogury are using Fraîche, and Lizarazu notes three more will open in January.</p>
<p>He expects to use the funding to grow Fraîche’s footprint in New York and to grow its team of eight employees, particularly in sales and marketing. He is hiring two sales reps and plans to have 20 employees overall by the third quarter of 2022. Fraîche has already signed 10 locations since the summer with plans to deploy into 30 locations in the next nine months and then grow to 100 locations by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>“It’s now a question of visibility,” Lizarazu said. “As long as our salespeople are talking to the right customers, we see the market is ready, and offices are really excited about what we are doing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food waste is a <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/i3991e/i3991e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.6 trillion problem globally</a> as some <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/food_practice/food_loss_and_waste/driven_to_waste_global_food_loss_on_farms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of food is wasted annually</a>. <a href="https://www.fullharvest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full Harvest</a> believes this is a distribution problem that can be solved by digitizing the produce supply chain.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company’s produce business-to-business marketplace provides a way for produce buyers and sellers to quickly close deals on surplus or imperfect crops in just a few clicks. It also creates an additional revenue stream for farmers.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Christine Moseley told TechCrunch that a majority of produce companies are still using pen, paper and fax machines to do business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248925" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“This is one of the most important industries, and we wanted to automate and bring the industry online to solve things that haven&#8217;t been solved before,” she added. “For example, there is a ton of paperwork involved in buying and selling, but by automating the onboarding process, that process that used to take weeks now take minutes.”</p>

<p>So Full Harvest got busy developing some technology that includes a spot marketplace with a matching algorithm and visibility so that buyers could see what suppliers had available. It also created a third-party audit and verification process to provide consistent specifications to reduce the average amount of rescued produce that is turned away. The industry average stands at 10%, while the company’s rejection average is 1% to 2%, Moseley said.</p>
<p>Within the past two years, Full Harvest’s impact on keeping food out of landfills grew five times, prompting the company to seek additional capital to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $23 million in Series B funding. Telus Ventures led the round, with participation from new investors Rethink Impact, Citi Impact, Doon Capital, Stardust Equity and Portfolia Food &amp; AgTech Fund, and existing investors, including Spark Capital, Cultivian Sandbox, Astia Fund and Radicle Growth. As part of the investment, Jay Crone, investment director at Telus, joined Full Harvest’s board of directors.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we checked in with Full Harvest. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/14/full-harvest-is-trying-to-fix-the-big-farm-food-waste-problem/">profiled the company</a> at the beginning of its journey in 2016 and then again in 2017 when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/full-harvest-raises-2-million-to-stop-farmers-from-tossing-ugly-fruit-and-veggies/">raised $2 million</a>. The company raised an additional $8.5 million in Series A funding in 2018. Including additional funding, the company now has $34.5 million in total funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company works with big names in the food and beverage, processor and grower industries, like Danone North America, SVZ and Tanimura &amp; Antle.</p>
<p>“The importance of building more sustainable businesses has never been more evident, especially for those in the food and beverage space,” said Surbhi Martin, vice president of Greek yogurt and functional nutrition for Danone North America. “By sourcing produce online through Full Harvest and selecting fruit for our products that would otherwise have gone to waste, we are answering the growing consumer demand for more sustainable food options.”</p>
<p>Full Harvest’s business model is to take a percentage of every transaction made on its marketplace. Between 2020 and 2021, the company tripled its revenue as it provided transparency into the supply chain, Moseley said. Back in 2018, Full Harvest had about eight employees; that has now grown to 35. The company also expanded geographically, including Canada.</p>
<p>With the new capital, Moseley intends to invest in technology development, triple the size of Full Harvest’s technology and product teams in 2022, continue to expand its footprint in North America and advance its data and market insights offerings, like produce availability, pricing, specifications, sustainable offerings, quality and forecasting support.</p>

<p>Full Harvest is not alone in addressing food waste and raising venture-backed capital for their efforts. Just this year, we’ve seen announcements from companies like:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">TreeDots raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/singapore-based-treedots-gets-11m-series-a-to-cut-food-waste-in-asia/">$11 million in Series A capital</a> for its B2B food surplus marketplace and a social commerce feature for group buying by consumers.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Shelf Engine, working to reduce food waste in grocery stores, brought in a $41 million Series B round in March and then an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-shaun-white-shawn-mendes-get-behind-shelf-engine/">additional $2 million</a> in September.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Food sharing app OLIO brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/food-sharing-app-olio-raises-43m-series-b-as-the-world-switches-on-to-the-food-waste-crisis/">$43 million in Series B funding</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Apeel, known for its plant-based layer covering fruits and vegetables, brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apeel-bites-into-another-250m-funding-round-at-a-2b-valuation-to-accelerate-fresh-food-supply-chains/">$250 million in Series E funding</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Too Good to Go <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apeel-bites-into-another-250m-funding-round-at-a-2b-valuation-to-accelerate-fresh-food-supply-chains/">secured $31.1 million</a> for its marketplace enabling customers to buy food right before it goes to waste.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Martie launched in November with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/martie-launches-with-3m-to-divert-shelf-stable-food-items-from-landfills/">$3 million in seed funding</a> to divert shelf-stable items from landfills.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Imperfect Foods brought in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/imperfect-foods-secures-95mm-series-d-investment-commitment-301212899.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$95 million in Series D</a> funding for its sustainable grocery delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>While that list of companies is innovating technology in the produce space, Moseley considers Full Harvest unique in that its expertise is on the sustainable product side and it has proven itself as a leader in digitization of the produce supply chain, putting it ahead of the curve on both fronts.</p>
<p>Up next, the company plans to secure partnerships around logistics technology to scale further and expand on the SKUs it is able to offer.</p>
<p>“We saw significant increase in our technology and user experiences after finishing some automating processes that were previously offline for the industry,” she added. “We also expanded on our spot buy marketplace and hit a big milestone of 50 million pounds sold.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian antitrust watchdog has revoked the approval it had granted for Amazon&#8217;s 2019 investment in a Future Group unit and imposed a fine of about $26.3 million to the American e-commerce giant for concealing facts.</p>
<p>The Competition Commission of India said Amazon, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/amazon-future-coupons/"> invested in Future Coupons</a> in 2019, &#8220;suppress[ed] the actual scope and purpose of the combination&#8221; and failed to notify some of its commercial arrangements.</p>
<p>Reliance Retail, India’s largest retail chain, said a year ago it had reached an agreement with Future Group to acquire the latter’s retail and wholesaler business, as well as its logistics and warehousing business, for $3.4 billion. (CCI has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/india-approves-reliances-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-brings-a-new-headache-to-amazon/">approved the deal between the nation&#8217;s two largest retail chains</a>.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Things began to get complicated shortly afterwards. Amazon accused Future Group of violating its contract and approached the Singapore arbitrator to halt the deal between the Indian firms, saying it had the right for first investment in Future Group. The matter reached India&#8217;s Supreme Court, which in August <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/india-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-amazon-to-stall-3-4b-future-and-reliance-deal/">ruled in favor of Amazon to stall the deal</a>.</p>
<p>The CCI, which originally approved the deal between Amazon and Future, began reviewing it again following a complaint from Future.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conduct of Amazon in supressing relevant and material documents against the disclosure requirement under Item 8.8 of Form I is a contravention of clause (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 45 of the Act,&#8221; said CCI in a 59-page order on Friday. [H/T <a href="https://twitter.com/adityakalra/status/1471809289253654533">Reuters journalist Aditya Kalra</a>.]</p>
<p>Amazon, which is required to pay the fine within 60 days, said in a statement that it was reviewing the order.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are reviewing the order passed by the Competition Commission of India, and will decide on next steps in due course,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The development comes days after Amazon <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/exclusive-amazon-says-india-revoking-future-deal-would-boost-reliance-hurt-2021-12-14/">warning the Indian antitrust body</a> that revoking its 2019 deal with Future Group would send a negative signal to foreign investors and enable Reliance, the owner of India&#8217;s largest retail chain, to &#8220;further restrict competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Confederation of All India Traders, a lobby group that represents millions of retailers in the South Asian market, said CCI&#8217;s Friday order is &#8220;a landmark order and Amazon stands fully exposed for its mal-practices, and bunch of lies at all levels together with continued violation of laws and the rules.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/adtech-not-checking-user-tcf-consent">research</a> examining what happens after Internet users in Europe land on an ad-supported website and express their &#8220;privacy choices&#8221; &#8212; using a flagship ad industry consent management platform which is supposed to allow them to control the types of ads they receive (i.e. non-tracking vs &#8220;personalized&#8221;) &#8212; has raised fresh questions over the IAB Europe&#8217;s self-styled Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF).</p>
<p>The TCF is already in hot water with privacy regulators.</p>
<p>Last month the IAB Europe announced that it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; and that the framework will also be found in breach. Although the IAB sought to suggest that a few tweaks will suffice to fix problems identified by the Belgian data protection authority (DPA).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248716" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re still waiting for publication of the final decision of the Belgian authority. But its preliminary findings &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">last year</a> &#8212; highlighted a litany of GDPR failures.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="454JUNMxH5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/embed/#?secret=454JUNMxH5" data-secret="454JUNMxH5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite all that, the IAB has continued to argue the TCF is working as intending for the close to 800 adtech vendors who are thought to participate in the system, loudly rejecting criticism of it. Its CEO, Townsend Feehan, for example, pooh-poohed criticism earlier this month &#8212; telling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-tracking-consent-iccl-iab-eu-gdpr-153055765.html">Engadget</a> that &#8220;none of this [tracking] happens if the user says no&#8221;.</p>
<p>However the new study throws doubt on the claim that if a user says &#8216;no&#8217; to tracking/behavioral ads via the IAB&#8217;s TCF, the adtech industry respectfully falls into line.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A key piece of this research examined how the adtech ecosystem responds to user signals that request only <em>basic</em>, i.e. non-tracking-based ads, to examine how ad vendors respond when users say no to &#8220;personalized&#8221; ads.</p>
<p>Here the researchers found evidence to suggest that many adtech vendors continue to track and profile Internet users when they have explicitly said they don&#8217;t want tracking-based ads.</p>
<p>While a number of earlier studies have found problems with how publishers in the EU have implemented cookie consents, such as tracking cookies being dropped prior to asking a site visitor for their permission, this new research, carried out by adtech researcher, <a href="https://adalytics.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adalytics</a>, aims to zero in on the TCF framework itself &#8212; by examining instances where ad-supported websites have faithfully reported users&#8217; ad choices.</p>
<p>Problematic data flows after that implicate the adtech industry itself &#8212; and the claims it makes for the TCF as a flagship compliance tool &#8212; because it suggests the framework fails to accurately reflect and <em>actually respect</em> users&#8217; &#8220;privacy choices&#8221; once they are passed to ad &#8220;partners&#8221;.</p>
<p>Listing a series of takeaways, Adalytics writes that the findings suggest:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many major ad tech vendors continue to track and profile EU users, even when an EU user has explicitly objected</li>
<li>The TCF strings that were designed by IAB Europe do not appear to be honored or parsed correctly by many ad tech vendors</li>
<li>Some ad tech vendors may not be able demonstrate they obtained user data with user consent, which may expose them to contractual compliance, investor/shareholder disclosure, and regulatory risks</li>
<li>In many instances, it is impossible for users to support media creators by allowing “basic ads” whilst disallowing tracking and behavioral profiling to protect their own privacy</li>
</ol>
<p>Although it&#8217;s important to note there are limits to what the researchers were able to observe via Chrome Developer Tools &#8212; given that any processing being done on adtech companies&#8217; own servers isn&#8217;t verifiable by such external research.</p>
<p>Understanding the full picture of what&#8217;s done with people&#8217;s data once the adtech ecosystem gets its hands on it is difficult. But that also cuts to the heart of surveillance-based advertising&#8217;s problem with complying with the GDPR &#8212; which also requires, accountability, transparency and security when processing people&#8217;s data, as well as a valid legal basis to do so.</p>
<p>Even setting those major overarching problems aside, just the fact of tracking cookies being dropped and user data being passed around when a person has explicitly said it should not be looks, well, awkward for the IAB&#8217;s TCF.</p>
<p>To study data activity at the adtech end of the framework, the researchers ran tests in a number of countries in the EU &#8212; visiting websites they manually verified had correctly configured the framework to send the user&#8217;s consent string, and selecting only basic ads; refusing personalized/tracking-based ads/profiling etc and also limited the choice of adtech processor to a single vendor.</p>
<p>The testers also made sure to object to &#8220;legitimate interests&#8221; so that their consent preferences could not be bypassed in that way.</p>
<p>If the TCF was functioning as Feehan&#8217;s remarks to Engadget earlier this month suggest &#8212; i.e. if users can just deny tracking simply by saying &#8216;no&#8217; via the TCF &#8212; the researchers would have expected to observe data flowing <em>only</em> as the individual had specified it should.</p>
<p>Instead, they found &#8212; in most cases &#8212; data flows that looked very different vs the choices that had been expressed.</p>
<p>The paper also details numerous instances of tracking cookies being set <em>prior</em> to the user&#8217;s consent choices even being signalled. (Although they say they excluded such examples from their analysis as they were specifically aiming to study what happens <em>after</em> a user has submitted their choices via the TCF.)</p>

<p>Examples cited in the study of adtech vendors appearing to override/ignore TCF signals denying tracking include a visitor with a Belgian IP address to a popular local news website,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nieuwsblad.be &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who provides consent to basic ads only, and only consents to ads from Google (so they&#8217;re explicitly rejecting &#8220;personalized&#8221; ads and profiling) &#8212; yet who, on checking </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrome Developer Tools for network HTTP requests, observes HTTPS requests sent to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ib.adnxs.com</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> domain owned by AppNexus (aka Xandr), which responds by dropping a cookie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called “uuid2” set for three months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given that [this user] objected to personalised ads and creating a personalised profile, only provided consent to Google, and the fact that these consent choices were directly included in the HTTP request to adnxs.com, it is not clear why the AppNexus server responded by setting a persistent, advertising related cookie in [the user&#8217;s] browser</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; the researchers observe.</span></p>
<p>In another example, a user with a French IP address visits the news website lemonde.fr and once again &#8212; despite not consenting to any cookies or purposes offered in the consent banner &#8212; <span style="font-weight: 400;">they see HTTPS request being sent to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">id5-sync.com</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which responds by setting a cookie called “id5” for three months, and triggering a 302 HTTP redirect to sync data with rtb-csync.smartadserver.com. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This specific HTTPS request that was sent to id5-sync.com contains the previously mentioned TCF string in a query string parameter called &#8220;gdpr_consent&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; the researchers report, adding that: &#8220;The domain <em>id5-sync.com</em> belongs to ID5, a London-based “<a href="https://id5.io/platform-privacy-policy/">identity platform</a> for the digital advertising industry”.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They further note that the ID5 Universal ID is described in a github overview as a &#8220;shared, neutral identifier that publishers, advertisers, and ad tech platforms can use to recognise users&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>So, again, if the user is saying they don&#8217;t want to be identified and tracked for ads, why is the id5 cookie being dropped at all?</p>
<p>In another example detailed in the study, also involving a French IP address &#8212; this time the user visits the newspaper<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">latribune.fr &#8212; the user&#8217;s consent choices are again apparently tossed in the virtual trash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this instance the user had specified they wanted basic ads served by US supply side platform OpenX. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Openx.net</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was observed triggering user ID syncs with &#8220;numerous other parties&#8221;, including Amazon, Google, DataXu, AppNexus, Beeswax (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bidr.io</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Adelphic Predictive Data platform (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ipredictive.com</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), AdPilot (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">erne.co</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), Simplifi Holdings (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">simpli.fi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and others, per the study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another example &#8212; involving a French IP user visiting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">atlantico.fr; and consenting to basic ads from Google only &#8212; the user sees a &#8220;lot of HTTPS requests being made with this TCF consent string, some of which appear to be user data syncing or setting tracking cookies&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers go on to note that: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A request sent to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s.cpx.to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responses by setting a cookie for 1-year called “cpSess”. This domain is owned by London-based Captify, and the “cpSess” cookie </span><a href="https://www.captifytechnologies.com/data-subject-rights-request/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appears to be used</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to store and link personal information about the user&#8221; &#8212; before citing another source that suggests this cookie is &#8220;used as a tracking mechanism for [&#8230;] advertising companies&#8221; and &#8220;helps with the delivery of targeted marketing adverts whilst users browse&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>The study details numerous other examples of unexpected data flows and syncing being observed after the user has asked not to be tracked.</p>
<p>The researchers also detail results of large-scale automated tests, as well as the manual examples cited above &#8212; based on crawler data from 48,698 different publisher domains &#8212; and here they found evidence of &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of ad requests erroneously claiming the GDPR does not apply to web users who were actually in the EU&#8230;</p>
<p>Out of 35,389 publishers found to have an HTTPS request that was sent to an ad tech vendor and contained either the ‘gdpr=0’ query string parameter, or the ‘gdpr=1’ query string parameter, 28,941 (81.8%) contained at least one HTTPS request sent to an ad tech vendor, wherein the query string macro parameter “gdpr=” was set to “0” &#8212; meaning they were signalling the GDPR does not apply.</p>
<p>More from Adalytics&#8217; write up:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to the IAB <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#full-tc-string-passing">TCF documentation</a> and to <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/9805023?hl=en">Google’s documentation</a>, “1 indicates that GDPR applies and 0 indicates that it does not.” Many ad tech vendors were observed processing the German and Finnish user data when “gdpr=0”, despite the crawler not having clicked on the CMP consent banner. In each of these cases, the ad tech vendor could have validated that the user was in fact in the EU by performing a simple<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_geolocation"> IP address geolocation lookup</a>. However, it appears that many take this “gdpr=0” parameter at face value, without performing any additional server-side checks, prior to sending tracking cookies or performing user data syncs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>To try to verify this finding, Adalytics says it reached out to a programmatic media buyer who <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">was targeting</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> ads to users across the EU, UK, and Switzerland. This buyer had their ads served a total of 111 million times &#8212; while the “gdpr_applies” macro was set to “0” 42.3% of the time &#8212; &#8220;indicating that the ad tech company involved was claiming that the GDPR does not apply to these users&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Yet on checking where those 47M ads were served, by using</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an IP address geo-location lookup service, Adalytics reports that the advertiser found the majority were served to users based in Spain, Croatia, Italy, France, and other EU countries, meaning the GDPR does actually apply&#8230;  </span></p>
<p>&#8220;If ad tech companies are not checking the integrity of the “gdpr_applies” strings by performing IP address geolocation checks, they may end up misleading their advertiser clients about the relevant regulations that apply to their advertising campaigns,&#8221; Adalytics goes on to warn.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">findings further highlight the scale of the problem of ad fraud &#8212; and, where the IAB Europe’s TCF framework is concerned, suggest it offers merely a veneer of legal compliance because it isn&#8217;t actually capable of doing what&#8217;s claimed on the tin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-too-often adtech vendors have not properly implemented and deployed it, per the research findings &#8212; making the &#8220;Transparency and Consent Framework&#8221; at best, a sham; or, well, compliance theatre. </span></p>
<p>Little wonder this whole system is in regulatory hot water &#8212; although the length of time it&#8217;s taken EU watchdogs to interrogate the reality underlying the adtech industry&#8217;s claims continues to be extremely troubling for anyone who cares about democratic oversight and fundamental rights.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Privacy experts slam UK&#8217;s &#8216;disastrous&#8217; failure to tackle unlawful adtech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/embed/#?secret=TAyraDwWQG" data-secret="TAyraDwWQG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The conclusion that we make in our study is that the adtech vendors have not taken the time, money and engineering labor hours to properly configure their servers and APIs,&#8221; Adalytics&#8217; founder Krzysztof Franaszek told TechCrunch, discussing the research. &#8220;In theory, all TCF participants&#8230; should have set up their servers and APIs in a way that checks and validates the TCF strings.</p>
<p>&#8220;If an API receives some user data, to which the TCF string shows the user has not consented, the vendor should immediately discard and avoid doing anything with that data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Franaszek noted that the researchers did observe at least one example of correct behavior &#8212; an instance where AppNexus received a TCF string that did not allow personalization, or for a vendor called Index Exchange to get the data, and &#8220;properly/rightfully configured their server to respond with an HTTP 400 error code, that says &#8216;Request failed due to privacy signals'&#8221;.</p>
<p>However he pointed out that that&#8217;s what &#8220;ALL 795 TCF companies <em>should be</em> doing&#8221;, and the study shows &#8212; on the contrary &#8212; many companies are simply not checking the strings.</p>
<p>Also commenting on the findings, Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties &#8212; and a long time adtech whistleblower who has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">filed numerous complaints</a> over real-time-bidding&#8217;s (RTB) abuse of personal data &#8212; said the study is just the latest illustration that &#8220;the TCF was just a bad idea&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no control. No technical measure to actually control what happens to the data,&#8221; Ryan told TechCrunch. &#8220;This means the TCF can never fulfil its purported objectives of providing control and transparency.</p>
<p>&#8220;The central argument we made to the Belgian APD [DPA] is that the TCF&#8217;s inevitable failure, due to the inherent and known insecurity of RTB, means that in addition to being an unnecessary nuisance in the lives of all Europeans, the TCF also infringes the data minimization principle [of GDPR] because it processes TCF string personal data for a purpose that is impossible to achieve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ryan also pointed back to some 2017 IAB correspondence &#8212; which came to light back in <a href="https://fixad.tech/february2019/">2019</a> via FOI &#8212; in which Feehan, who was at the time seeking to lobby the European Commission on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/">ePrivacy rules</a>, implies consent is incompatible with RTB &#8212; attaching a paper to her email to EU lawmakers with the observation that “it is technically impossible for the user to have prior information about every data controller involved in a real-time bidding (RTB) scenario”.</p>
<p>And for consent to be valid under GDPR it must be specific, <em>informed</em>, and &#8212; indeed &#8212; freely given.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the Adalytics study &#8212; such as the manual component being limited to a small number of publishers that &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">appear to correctly encode user consent input, in order to rule out the possibility that a publisher’s or CMP’s errors were resulting in user profiling occurring without a user’s consent&#8221;, as Franaszek puts it.</span></p>
<p>It is also not clear how many/what proportion of the 795 adtech companies using the TCF system aren&#8217;t properly respecting user choices. The instance cited above where a user denial of consent was correctly responded to shows it can happen. How often it does is a whole other matter, though.</p>
<p>In any case, those vendors observed by the researchers apparently not respecting users&#8217; denial of tracking included &#8220;several multi-billion dollar multinationals like Rubicon, Pubmatic, Amazon, Google and Trade Desk&#8221;, per Franaszek.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if you look at the stock market capitalization of the vendors that we examined, it&#8217;s far greater than 50% of the total digital advertising industry,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>A more general caveat is that, <span style="font-weight: 400;">given the adtech industry&#8217;s highly opaque character, it&#8217;s always difficult to understand how data is or isn&#8217;t being processed &#8212; and the researchers acknowledge that a lot of &#8220;nuance&#8221; is required to interpret the data in a section of the paper discussing limitations.  </span></p>
<p>The study has also not gone through formal peer review so has not been subject to the rigorous academic process required if it had been published in a peer reviewed journal.</p>
<p>But, well, the findings sure don&#8217;t look good for adtech.</p>
<p>Per public documentation on a <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/pubvendors.json%20v1.0%20Draft%20for%20Public%20Comment.md">github repository</a> for v1.0 of the IAB&#8217;s TCF framework, the ad industry body suggested that their &#8212; at that time &#8212; incoming &#8220;technical industry solution&#8221; would allow website operators to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Control the vendors they wish to allow to access their users&#8217; browsers (for setting and reading cookies) and process their personal data and disclose these choices to other parties in the online advertising ecosystem</li>
<li>Seek user consent under the ePrivacy Directive (for setting cookies or similar technical applications that access information on a device) and/or the GDPR in line with applicable legal requirements and signal the consent status through the online advertising ecosystem</li>
</ol>
<p>The question that naturally follows from those stated capabilities is well, what then? What happens after users&#8217; &#8216;privacy choices&#8217; are signalled to the data-gobbling adtech ecosystem? How does the TCF actually <em>ensure</em> ad vendors respect people&#8217;s choices?</p>
<p>Adalytics&#8217; research is just the latest study to suggest that industry standard pop-up &#8220;privacy choices&#8221; are a mirage; a suggestive illusion of choice wrapped in a pantomime of consent in a bid to square the impossible circle for surveillance ads: GDPR compliance.</p>
<p>Because it seems the only way to be sure the &#8220;choice&#8221; that you ask the TCF to pass on to adtech vendors will get respected is if you ask for the tracking to continue&#8230;</p>
<p>The IAB has been contacted for comment on Adalytics&#8217; research, and also with questions regarding whether it takes any steps to verify that participating ad vendors are complying with TCF strings expressing user choices.</p>
<p>We have also asked the IAB how it expects to adapt the framework &#8212; and its own activities &#8212; in order to come into compliance with GDPR, in light of the Belgian finding of a breach.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this report with any response.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hevo Data, a SaaS startup that is helping firms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/hevo-draws-in-8-million-series-a-for-its-no-code-data-pipeline-service/">collate troves of data they generate and accumulate</a> to make better use of them, has raised $30 million in a new financing round following a strong year of growth.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India led the San Francisco and Bangalore-headquartered startup’s $30 million Series B round. A number of investors including Qualgro, Lachy Groom, and Chiratae Ventures also participated in the round, which pushes the five-year-old startup all-time funding to $43 million.</p>
<p>Firms, with so many divisions such as marketing, engineering, and design, engage with numerous services and platforms for their business. But the data they generate and rely on sits in silos within those divisions, making it difficult for the firm as a whole to gain real-time visibility into it and take actionable decisions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249176" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://hevodata.com">Hevo Data</a> has built a data pipeline platform to make it exceedingly easy for firms to integrate and fetch data from different sources to one dashboard as well as to supply it to popular cloud data-warehouses such as Snowflake, Google BigQuery, and Amazon Redshift, explained Manish Jethani, co-founder and chief executive of the startup, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Different parts of the company use different types of software for their work. But if the data doesn’t flow across different departments, nobody will have full visibility into what all that is happening,” he said, drawing parallels with the flow of blood in a human body.</p>
<p>“So as a business, if I have invested thousands of dollars in marketing, I would want to know how many users came and bought – or not purchase – from the platform and how many times they made the purchase. How much money did I end up making per order? This would help me inform how I should be tweaking my marketing spends,” he said. “For this, I have to combine my marketing, orders data, finance data, and customer support data,” he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a challenge that Jethani grappled with in his previous startup, called SpoonJoy, which he sold to Grofers. After moving to Grofers, a much bigger startup, Jethani said he realized that even larger firms face this challenge. (He said that companies as large as Amazon and Flipkart tend to build their own workflows and have large workforces to tackle this.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup’s offering combines data from multiple disparate sources and applications including sales CRM, advertising channels, marketing tech, financial system software, and customer support products to build a 360-degree view of their business and customers, said Jethani.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249182" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249182" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2249182 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="303" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg?resize=150,45 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg?resize=300,91 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg?resize=768,233 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg?resize=680,206 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/hevo-data-integrations.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249182" class="wp-caption-text">Some popular integrations offered by Hevo.</p></div></p>
<p>One of the additional value prepositions of Hevo is that it’s a no-code platform. Individuals are not spending much time – or require any technical understanding in – establishing the integrations to get the data to flow to a central hub, he said. (The accessibility is as simple as setting up an action on IFTTT, for instance.) Hevo features <a href="https://hevodata.com/integrations/">over 100 pre-built integrations</a> across databases, SaaS applications, cloud storage, SDKs, and streaming services.</p>
<p>The startup said it has amassed over 1,000 customers across multiple categories in more than 40 countries and will deploy the fresh funds to develop new products as it moves to tap a bigger slice of the market. The startup said it grew by a whopping 500% in the past year. One of the new offerings it is working on is an insight platform that will enable users to do analysis with the data they are collating.</p>
<p>Another product in the works is called &#8220;Reverse ETL,&#8221; which will aim to help customers use their data beyond just the analytics use case, he said.</p>
<p>“Data has become one of the most important business inputs in the last decade. Hevo Data is building foundational infrastructure to enable bi-directional mobility of data,” said Tejeshwi Sharma, MD at Sequoia India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“The more mobile data becomes within organizations, the more useful it shall be. We are impressed by the product DNA of the company &#8211; the secret behind the widely loved product combines the duality of technical sophistication and consumer grade experience. Sequoia Capital India is delighted to double down on the partnership with Hevo and lead the Series B round.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A digital mobile overdraft facility christened <a href="https://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/credit-and-savings/fuliza">Fuliza</a>, by Kenya’s biggest telco Safaricom Plc, is giving the country’s popular loan apps a run for their money barely three years after its launch.</p>
<p>Fuliza allows Safaricom customers to access unsecured credit by overdrawing on M-Pesa – the telecommunication company mobile money wallet that allows its users to pay bills, send, receive and withdraw money through their phones.</p>
<p>The uptake of Fuliza is currently at 18.3% across the country while that of loan apps decreased by 6.2 percentage points to 2.1% in the last two years, a <a href="https://www.knbs.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-Finaccess-Household-Survey-Report.pdf">study</a> by the country’s monetary authority, Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in collaboration with Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) and Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSD) Kenya shows.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249002" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest bi-annual FinAccess Household Survey report said digital loan apps experienced the largest decline in usage when compared to other financial products and services by credit-unions, banks and microfinance institutions.</p>
<p>“This may be explained by competition from formal digital credit products like Fuliza, (and) unfair debt collection practices by the digital loan apps,” said the report.</p>
<p>The report also said that a directive by the CBK, barring unlicensed digital lenders from sharing the personal details of loan defaulters with credit reference bureaus (CRBs), may have deterred the apps from lending to customers viewed as risky.</p>
<p>Additionally, the uncertainty around the regulation of the apps by the CBK during the Covid-19 peak may have prevented them from extending credit to new borrowers. A bill on the regulation of digital lenders was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/kenyas-president-signs-new-law-to-police-digital-lenders-apps-have-six-months-to-apply-for-licenses/">tabled before Kenya’s legislative assembly and was just this month signed into a law</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Digital Lenders Association of Kenya, which represents about 25 digital lenders out of the over 100 operating in Kenya, told TechCrunch in a past interview that its members generally give out loans worth $40 million every month, an amount that was, however, halved during Covid.</p>
<p>Fuliza, which is formally registered and licensed, operates in partnership with two local banks – KCB and NCBA. The product seems to have filled the mobile lending void obstructed by regulation, and has has now stepped-up competition for mobile loan apps like the Silicon-valley backed Branch, which launched in Kenya in 2015, and the pay-pal supported Tala, which set-up operations in the country in 2014 – one of the first digital lenders to enter the East African country.</p>
<p>According to a Safaricom <a href="https://www.safaricom.co.ke/images/Downloads/Safaricom_2021_Sustainable_Business_Report.pdf">report</a>, the telco extended $3.1 billion in Fuliza credit during the 2020/21 financial year, a 43 percent increase from the previous year. This translates to an estimated $12 million credit that Fuliza extends to Kenyans every day. Safaricom has 23.8 million M-Pesa customers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout"><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="Fuliza amount disbursed over the years" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/waTe4/6/#?secret=q45ZiNBiK9" data-secret="q45ZiNBiK9" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="267"></iframe></div>
<p>The genesis of mobile lending in Kenya can be traced back to 2012, when Safaricom launched M-Shwari, a mobile-based savings and loans product, that is still running in partnership with NCBA Bank. Since then, Kenya has experienced a flurry of digital and micro-lending apps, amounting to hundreds.</p>
<p>Loan apps and facilities such as Fuliza offer instant collateral-free credit, overshadowing loans by conventional banking facilities, which go through lengthy approval processes, while mostly requiring extensive collateral. These fintech innovations may also be one of the reasons why Kenya’s formal financial inclusion is at 83.7% in 2021 from 26.7% in 2006.</p>
<p>However, while the lending apps have provided credit relief to people left out by the formal banking sector, they have operated in an unregulated environment for years until a fortnight ago when the president signed a new law giving CBK the authority to license and oversee their operations.</p>
<p>The lack of regulation has left gaps for predatory pricing, with some of the apps charging annualized interest rates exceeding 800%, leaving many borrowers impoverished.</p>
<p><strong>Debt crisis</strong></p>
<p>The FinAccess report states that half (50.9%) of the surveyed respondents had failed to repay loans sourced from the lending apps.</p>
<p>“The top three credit providers where a majority of respondents reported to have defaulted on a credit facility are; mobile banking loan (including Fuliza), digital apps loan and loan from family/friend/neighbor,” said the report.</p>
<p>Among the leading concerns for borrowers was the high cost of accessing and maintaining the loans due to the exorbitant interest rates by the mobile lenders. Unexpected charges, mostly imposed after repayment default, and a lack of transparency in pricing and other charges beforehand were also cited as worrisome issues.</p>
<p>To fix the problem of hidden charges,the country’s competition authority communicated that it will from June next year require all digital lenders to disclose their full fees and penalties every four months.</p>
<p>Besides, with the newly-passed law, lenders are compelled to apply for licenses from the CBK, as compared to previously, when they only had to register to set up operations.</p>
<p>They are also instructed to observe customer confidentiality and not share data with third parties– usually debt collectors. The latter requirement, especially, shields borrowers from rogue digital lenders that use debt shaming tactics when collecting monies owed to them by borrowers. Non-compliance will lead to the revocation of licenses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company's tools digitize for small businesses what was traditionally done manually and on paper, like invoices.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getfuzey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fuzey</a>, a London-based company providing what it calls a “digital one-stop shop” for small businesses and independent contractors, raised $4.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by byFounders with participation from Flash Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Ascension and a group of angel investors, including Index Ventures’ venture partner Stephane Kurgan and Amplo VC founder and CEO Sheel Tyle.</p>
<p>The latest round gives the company $5.2 million in total funding since the company was founded in 2020 by Henrik Lysgaard Jensen and Alex Boyce. As part of the investment, byFounders investor Sara Rywe and Flash Ventures partner Lorenzo Franzi have joined the company’s board.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248896" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Lysgaard Jensen and COO Boyce met each other about two years ago and bonded over helping small businesses digitize. Targeting small business owners, like plumbers, electricians and mechanics, Lysgaard Jensen believes local businesses “are the backbone of every community,” but many of the tools developed for business management are either out of reach to businesses like this nor designed with them in mind.</p>
<p>Other startups are also calling attention to these types of businesses. In November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/puls-technologies-on-demand-home-repair-service/">Puls Technologies raised $15 million</a> for its mobile app connecting tradespeople with on-demand home repair services. There are also larger companies in the space, like Jobber, which announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/jobber-raises-60m-as-its-platform-for-home-service-professionals-hits-100k-users/">$60 million in funding</a> at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>This area is also particularly personal for Boyce, who explained that his mother is a small business owner who ran much of her business out of a leather-bound notebook, always fearing that it might get lost.</p>
<p>“These are topics we are working through,” he told TechCrunch. “We thought about how we could become agents of change during the pandemic, which was a wake-up call as we saw shifting consumer demands, people wanting to get more technology-centric and engage with local merchants in different ways.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As such, the company&#8217;s tools digitize for small businesses what was traditionally done manually and on paper, like invoices. It brings together communications, payments, marketing and calendars into one dashboard to manage their businesses and amp up their online profiles.</p>
<p>Users are able to communicate with their customers through a variety of methods, from messaging to social media, while also generating invoices for instant payment and insights into lead generation. Fuzey also offers document templates and one-click customer reviews to make the process of leaving a review easier.</p>
<p>“Response time is important, and we even have response templates with predefined questions or comments so you can get back to customers quickly,” Lysgaard Jensen said. “We are big believers in the 20, 30, 40-time impact of this.”</p>
<p>The company, which went live with its product in June, will utilize the new funding on product development and geographical expansion. It is already operating in select markets in Europe, the U.S. and Canada. Fuzey has 10 employees right now and is seeing double-digit growth month over month in both customers and revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alibaba has always aspired to bring its e-commerce service to customers outside China. Its strategy is multi-thronged. The giant&#8217;s house-developed AliExpress has found success <a href="https://www.alizila.com/aliexpress-russia-social-commerce-joint-venture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Russia</a> in recent years. In 2016, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/18/alibaba-doubles-down-on-lazada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought Lazada</a>, which came out of the Rocket Internet empire, and has helped the Southeast Asia-focused marketplace compete.</p>
<p>Lazada grew 80% to hit 130 million annual active consumers in the 18 months ended September, according to a <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/presentations/Investor_Day_2021_Lazada.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a> at Alibaba&#8217;s investor day on Thursday. Its monthly active <em>users</em> as of September were 159 million &#8212; larger than its AAC likely because not every user on Lazada ends up purchasing things.</p>
<p>Like its Chinese sister app Taobao, Lazada has introduced entertainment features like livestreaming and games that try to lock users in, making it more than a pure shopping app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lazada wrapped up 2021 with $21 billion in gross merchandise value, the amount of sales before expenses are deducted. 922,000 sellers, many of whom are from China, were active monthly on the marketplace as of September, more than doubling the pool size from a year ago.</p>
<p>Alibaba is hardly the only Chinese tech titan wrestling for a slice of Southeast Asia&#8217;s flourishing digital economy. Its nemesis Tencent is one of the main investors in Sea Group, which operates Lazada&#8217;s rival platform Shopee. In 2020, Sea logged<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210302005582/en/Sea-Limited-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $35.4 billion in GMV</a>.</p>
<p>Alibaba&#8217;s other Chinese competitor, JD.com, saw its Indonesia e-commerce unit JD.ID rise up to unicorn valuation in early 2020, TechCrunch learned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years ago, a group of entrepreneurs in Pakistan began surveying the market to understand why financial services weren’t reaching the majority of merchants in the world’s fifth most populous nation.</p>
<p>On Friday, Tiger Global said it is backing their startup, <a href="http://creditbook.pk/">CreditBook</a>, to help address those challenges. This is the New York-headquartered firm’s first investment in Pakistan.</p>
<p>A number of other investors, including Better Tomorrow Ventures, Firstminute Capital, Banana Capital, VentureSouq, Ratio Ventures and i2i Ventures, as well as angel investors Sriram Krishnan and Julian Shapiro also participated in the $11 million pre-Series A round. This is also Firstminute Capital’s first investment in the South Asian market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We started the research and began experimentation in late 2019,” said Iman Jamall, co-founder of CreditBook, in an interview with TechCrunch. “I was working as a service designer on a project for one of the largest Pakistani banks at the time and was observing different persona types to understand why financial services hadn&#8217;t made inroads in the country.”</p>
<p>The challenges that Jamall, one of the few female founders in the country, identified were cash flow, the role of credit and the social relationships around it, and the over reliance on “paper for everything essentially,” she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249107" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249107" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2249107 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/creditbook-app-pakistan.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249107" class="wp-caption-text">Images credit: CreditBook</p></div></p>
<p>The over reliance on paper to maintain ledger and the always-running low cash flow is a challenge that merchants in many markets in South Asia and Southeast Asia share. As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/from-indias-richest-man-to-amazon-and-100s-of-startups-the-great-rush-to-win-neighborhood-stores/">previously covered</a>, often these small businesses run on informal credit and rely on money they secure from selling their existing inventory to buy their next batch. The customers buy things for weeks and sometimes months before they clear the tab.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These shortcomings are hurting these small businesses and mom and pop stores and impeding their growth at a time when large e-commerce giants are attempting to court customers.</p>
<p>CreditBook today offers a bookkeeping app to merchants, enabling them to digitize the handwritten ledger that they have traditionally used to keep track of daily accounts.</p>
<p>The eponymous mobile app has amassed merchants in over 400 towns and cities, the startup said. CreditBook declined to reveal the number of merchants who are using the service, but said that the number of transacting users has increased by 10 times since last year.</p>
<p>Digital bookkeeping is the startup’s marquee offering today, but Jamall said CreditBook is working on building and testing financial products on top of it. It’s too early to unveil precisely what those financial products would look like, she said. (But it’s definitely not e-commerce, she said.)</p>
<p>Jamall offered some context around the areas CreditBook is exploring. “In Pakistan, there is a huge whitespace in payments. But mobile money has started to gain traction, especially amid the pandemic,” she said, adding that the local regulator has also made a push in recent years to accelerate the adoption of mobile payments and is focusing on building an instant payments infrastructure. (Similar to India’s UPI, which in recent years has become the most popular way users transact online.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a massive opportunity. CreditBook estimates that there&#8217;s a $45 billion unmet financing gap for small businesses. Pakistan, home of over 220 million people, 60% of whom is under the age of 30.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with CreditBook and make Tiger Global’s first investment into Pakistan,” said John Curtius, a Partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. “The investment is a testament to the incredible traction and vision demonstrated by the team.”</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s announcement builds on what has been a watershed year for Pakistan&#8217;s fast-growing startup ecosystem as several global investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Addition, 20VC and Buckley Ventures make their first bets in the country. Startups in Pakistan have raised over $300 million this year, more than previous six years combined. Grocery delivery startup Krave Mart announced earlier this week it had raised $6 million in its pre-seed funding round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Journalists, activists, and human rights defenders face a constant battle to keep files safe from a growing set of digital threats and surveillance. But physical attacks can be challenging to defend against, whether an opportunist snatch-and-grab thief or an oppressive government kicking down someone&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>This week, a <a href="https://www.buskill.in/">project called BusKill</a> launched a custom USB magnetic breakaway cable that acts as a &#8220;dead man&#8217;s switch,&#8221; locking a computer if someone physically snatches it and severs the magnetic connectors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249111" style="width: 545px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249111" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2249111 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/buskill.gif" alt="" width="535" height="301" /><p id="caption-attachment-2249111" class="wp-caption-text">The BusKill cable locking a computer when the severed. (Image: BusKill)</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>BusKill has been in the works for more than two years as a <a href="https://docs.buskill.in/buskill-app/en/stable/">do-it-yourself project</a>. Anyone with the hardware could compile the source code, but it only worked on Linux and components quickly sold out.</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/alt-shift/buskill">crowdsourcing effort</a>, the cable is now available to buy starting at $59 and has an accompanying app that works on macOS, Windows, and Linux, allowing the person using the cable to easily arm and disarm the cable with a touch of a button.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people aren&#8217;t handling top-secret documents from whistleblowers and worried about the secret police knocking down their doors, but that&#8217;s the level of risk that I designed BusKill for,&#8221; the project&#8217;s creator Michael Altfield told TechCrunch. &#8220;And I wanted it to be accessible to journalists who don&#8217;t necessarily use Linux and don&#8217;t know how to use the CLI [command line interface].&#8221;</p>
<p>BusKill is designed to lock your computer when it’s physically separated from you, but Linux users can further configure the app to trigger a self-destruct command, which scrambles the device&#8217;s cryptographic keys, rendering the computer&#8217;s data inaccessible in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>The project also plans to release triggers that shuts down a computer when the magnetic cable is severed.</p>
<p>Although Altfield said BusKill was designed with journalists and activists in mind, the cable can also protect the computers of travelers on vacation and other high-risk users, like crypto traders.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/byjus-spac-public-listing/">Byju’s could go public via SPAC:</a> </strong>In the wake of Grab’s mega-SPAC deal, Indian edtech giant Byju’s could be prepping to take a similar path to the U.S. public markets, TechCrunch reports. Our own Manish Singh notes that Byju’s is “seeking a valuation of over $45 billion and looking to raise as much as $4 billion” in the transaction.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/reddit-ipo/"><strong>Reddit files to go public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Speaking of mega-public offerings for early 2022, Reddit announced today that it filed to go public. The social company’s filing is still private, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/a-few-questions-about-the-impending-reddit-ipo/">but TechCrunch has <em>questions</em>, y’all</a>. It’s a tossup regarding which dataset we’re more excited about between Byju’s and Reddit, but the start of next year is looking busy. Already.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/internet-association-shuts-down/">Tech’s collective lobbying group falls apart:</a> </strong>The Internet Association is winding down, TechCrunch reports. The lobbying group once represented a diverse set of tech companies, which was perhaps its downfall. Given that its members don’t agree on all matters, the shattering is not a surprise in retrospect. And considering how much tech regulation could land in the next few years, what rises in the void left by the Internet Association will be fascinating.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>As we did yesterday, we’re taking a deeper look at a few key startup stories today, and then running through a host of smaller items so that we can get as much of our reporting into the newsletter as possible!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/cockroach-rolls-on-with-278m-series-f-on-5b-valuation/">You can’t kill Cockroach Labs:</a></strong> Not that anyone was trying &#8212; that’s just the wittiest riff we could come up with to introduce our reporting that the database company just raised a bunch of new capital at a $5 billion valuation. That’s up from $2 billion earlier this year. Our own Ron Miller writes that Cockroach “has 200 paying customers, with the cloud side of the business growing at 500% over the last year and ARR tripling YoY from Q3 to Q3.” We want hard numbers, but those are at least directionally interesting.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/gopuff-the-instant-grocery-startup-is-raising-up-to-1-5b-at-up-to-a-40b-valuation-ahead-of-going-public-as-soon-as-mid-2022/"><strong>Gopuff is raising $1.5B, could go public next year:</strong></a> Circling back to 2022 IPOs, quick delivery company Gopuff is working to raise around $1.5 billion in convertible debt at a roughly $40 billion valuation. And, our own Ingrid Lunden reports, the SoftBank-backed company could go public next year. If it does, the debut could lead to even more investment into related companies around the world — consumers wanting stuff, fast, is popular the world ‘round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/vertical-farming-startup-infarm-raises-200m-for-international-expansion/"><strong>Vertical farming grows vertical valuation:</strong></a> Europe-based vertical farming firm Infarm raised $200 million this week, pushing its valuation north of the $1 billion mark. Vertical farming brings food creation nearer to urban hubs, potentially limiting carbon output. The concept appears to be <em>growing</em> and could prove <em>nutritious </em>for both consumers and investors alike.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/voodoo-bets-on-play-to-earn-crypto-mobile-games/">Why do play-to-earn games sound like a job?</a></strong> Voodoo, a French company, is going to put hundreds of millions of dollars into so-called “play-to-earn” games. Today, Voodoo is known for its casual games that have racked up billions of downloads. In the future it will also have blockchain games in the market, where players can earn digital currency or NFTs for their playing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And then, a host of other happenings for your further research:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tiger-global-leads-cash-infusion-into-elementary-for-automated-manufacturing-inspection/">Machine vision AI company Elementary has raised a $30 million Series B</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/cytrox-predator-phone-hacking-meta/">There are more companies out there than just NSO Group hacking folks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/how-to-build-a-better-rocket-company/">Our own Darrell Etherington has notes on how to build a rocket company</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/weight-care-management-startup-found-lands-100m-at-a-600m-valuation/">Found raises $100M at a $600M valuation for its weight-management service</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/silverflow-nabs-17m-for-its-updated-cloud-based-take-on-payments-processing-technology/">Silverflow raises $17M for cloud payments</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/carbonchain-helps-automate-carbon-accounting-across-supply-chains/">And CarbonChain is working to automate carbon accounting in the supply chain</a></li>

<p>Dear Sophie,</p>
<p>The 2021 H-1B lottery process has been quite a rollercoaster!</p>
<p>We sponsored several people in this year’s lottery. One of our registrants was selected in the first round in March, but none were selected in the second round in July.</p>
<p>We just found out another of our registrants was selected in November, however, he’s from South Africa and restricted from traveling to the U.S. due to omicron.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/dear-sophie-how-to-maneuver-the-latest-travel-bans-h-1b-alternatives/">What should we do?</a> Any suggestions for what to do about our other prospective hires who didn’t get selected?</p>
<p>— Eager Employer</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/apple-releases-swift-playground-4-with-support-for-app-development-on-ipad/"><strong>Apple drops Swift Playgrounds 4:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This bit of news means that app development on your iPad is now easier, thanks to the new edition of Swift Playgrounds from the Cupertino-based tech giant. The boundaries for getting into development work are slowly falling, and I consider this particular item indicative of that trend.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/instagram-now-lets-you-embed-a-miniature-version-of-your-profile-into-a-website/">You can now embed a mini-profile from Instagram into your website</a></strong></li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/sidewalk-labs-products-will-be-folded-into-google-proper/"><strong>Alphabet folds Sidewalk Labs into Google:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Yes, you had forgotten about the smart city project Sidewalk Labs, but don’t feel bad about it. Google parent company Alphabet is baking the project into new parent company Google.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/waymo-says-self-driving-car-that-struck-pedestrian-in-san-francisco-was-in-manual-mode/"><strong>And, finally from Alphabet, the Waymo car that hit someone was in manual mode:</strong></a> Here’s an example of bad, but weirdly good news. No, it is not good that a Waymo car hit someone. But, yes, at the same time, it’s weirdly good that it was not in self-driving mode. Why? Because the accident won’t hit the brakes on self-driving development. Which <em>is</em> good because I don’t want to drive.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many brands are using the messaging app Discord to forge a sense of community among their fans. If the fast-food chain <a href="https://discord.com/invite/wendys">Wendy&#8217;s</a> can have a Discord with over 60,000 members, why not a viral platform like TikTok?</p>
<p>TikTok <a href="https://twitter.com/tiktok_us/status/1471208467251834880">teased on Twitter</a> that it was making a Discord server, but then confirmed the news on its own app today. Now, on TikTok&#8217;s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tiktok">brand new Discord</a>, you can chat with strangers about&#8230; whatever you&#8217;d want to talk to a bunch of TikTokers about. Maybe the best way to make Emily Mariko&#8217;s <a href="https://www.insider.com/emily-mariko-salmon-rice-recipe-tiktok-ice-cube-2021-9#emily-marikos-content-has-exploded-on-tiktok-over-the-past-two-weeks-1">viral salmon recipe</a>?</p>

<p>As of publication, there are only 400 people in the Discord, which TikTok told TechCrunch is a &#8220;soft launch.&#8221; There are 5 moderators from TikTok, which could pose a problem if the server continues to grow. As one user said, &#8220;let&#8217;s take the advantage [to talk to each other] when there are not 300,000 people trying to chat at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>To prevent spam (which is also against the rules), TikTok is using &#8220;slowmode,&#8221; a Discord feature that only lets people send a message every 30 seconds. But users quickly got around the slowmode by making <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/discord-threads/">threads</a>, where the time limit between messages doesn&#8217;t apply. Soon after, moderators removed the ability to make threads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise CEO Dan Ammann is leaving the company, its parent company General Motors said in late afternoon statement.</p>
<p>Kyle Vogt, who co-founded the autonomous vehicle company, and was the company&#8217;s first CEO will take over the role on an interim basis. Vogt has been serving as Cruise&#8217;s president and CTO. Wesley Bush, the former Chairman and CEO of Northrop Grumman and a GM board member, will join the Cruise board, GM said.</p>
<p>GM and Cruise did not provide additional details about why Ammann was leaving. The departure of the longtime GM executive is unexpected and came as a surprise to Cruise employees who asked not to be identified. The news was shared with Cruise employees Thursday as it was shared with the public with one person noting it seemed unplanned and chaotic. One anecdote that illustrates the lack of planning around Ammann&#8217;s departure was staff waited for more than 10 minutes to hear from GM chairman and CEO Mary Barra who was unable to join a virtual town hall meeting meant to explain the change. Vogt ended up having to put her on speakerphone from his smartphone so she could communicate with Cruise staff.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ammann was at the center of GM&#8217;s initial investment and acquisition of Cruise. He oversaw GM&#8217;s relationship with Cruise. And he was the person with whom Vogt had regular contact. Vogt even mentioned his connection to Ammann while onstage at SF Disrupt in September 2018. Ammann also came to the job with a specific skill set. When Ammann first joined GM in 2010 as vice president of finance and treasurer, his first task was to manage GM&#8217;s initial public offering. At the time, Ammann&#8217;s appointment as Cruise CEO seemed to signal that an IPO could be a goal.</p>
<p>Ammann was tapped to be CEO of Cruise in late 2018. He took over officially in January 2019. At the time, the move seemed to make sense. Cruise had grown from a small startup with 40 employees to more than 1,000 by the time Ammann took over.</p>
<p>And while Ammann continued to push the company to expand, there were missed targets, notably the plan to launch a commercial robotaxi business in 2019. The company has spent the past two years inching towards that commercialization goal, along with the rest of the industry, which has gone through a spate of consolidation.</p>
<p>GM outlined a bullish autonomous vehicle plan at its October investor day and its branded &#8220;Under the Hood&#8221; event the following month. Those ambitions included comments from Ammann who laid out the company&#8217;s plan to launch a commercial robotaxi and delivery service starting with retrofitted Chevy Bolts and eventually scaling to an army of tens of thousands of purpose-built Origin AVs on the road over the next few years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Separately, Cruise&#8217;s go-to-market VP Lucas Watson left the company last week, according to several sources with direct knowledge. While one his departure is apparently unrelated it does raise questions about the business side of Cruise, aspects of which Ammann and Watson would have been focused on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hulu is the latest company to <a href="https://press.hulu.com/news/2021/12/16/year-with-hulu-2021-its-in-your-dna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce</a> a Spotify Wrapped-like personalized end-of-year recap feature. The streaming service is giving subscribers the option to learn more about their viewing habits through a new <a href="https://yourtvdna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Your TV DNA&#8221; tool</a>. The tool is accessible on a newly launched website where users can access a profile of their personalized viewing habits throughout the year. The tool analyzes users&#8217; streaming habits and shares information about things like their most-watched genres and how many films and TV show episodes they watched.</p>
<p>To get started, subscribers need to log into their Hulu accounts on the website in order to receive their recap. From there, the tool will analyze the user&#8217;s data and then display their most-watched genres, which can include categories like edgy comedies, high-stakes dramas, crime dramas and more. The recap will also include a &#8220;streaming persona&#8221; that&#8217;s meant to represent the user&#8217;s viewing habits of the year.</p>

The recommendations include upcoming or current content that is similar to what the user has already watched. Users also have the option to share their recap with others on social media.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249020" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This year, for the first time, Hulu is giving subscribers the opportunity to request to see their own viewing DNA and the tools to proudly share, should they so choose, their streaming persona,&#8221; the company said in a <a href="https://press.hulu.com/news/2021/12/16/year-with-hulu-2021-its-in-your-dna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> regarding the announcement. &#8220;Starting today, subscribers can visit <a href="https://yourtvdna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="2">YourTVDNA.com</a> and request to see their personalized Hulu viewing habits throughout 2021.&#8221;</p>

<div class="article-content">
<p>The launch of the new feature comes as shareable end-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular thanks to Spotify’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/spotifys-wrapped-2021-arrives-with-artist-video-messages-blend-and-even-a-game/"> annual Wrapped</a> experience that is widely shared across social media each year. Given its success, it’s no surprise that other companies are mimicking the popular features. Hulu joins many other digital giants that have released their own Wrapped-like features. Last week, Facebook and Instagram<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/facebook-and-instagram-roll-out-personalized-year-in-review-features/"> introduced</a> personalized &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; features to give users a way to reflect on the past year. Reddit also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/reddit-rolls-out-personalized-end-of-year-recaps-with-stats-about-users-habits/">rolled out</a> personalized recaps with stats about users’ habits last week; meanwhile, Snapchat launched its “Year End Story” this week.</p>
<p>In addition to the personalized recaps, Hulu also released information about overall trends on its platform. The company revealed that &#8220;Only Murders in the Building&#8221; was its most-watched comedy series and that &#8220;Nine Perfect Strangers&#8221; set a new record as its most-watched series ever. Hulu also notes that adult animation was the No. 1 genre on the streaming service based on hours watched.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also outlined that the most streamed day of 2021 was Sunday, January 31, largely because subscribers tuned into the previous evening’s &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; episode hosted by John Krasinski. In terms of non-original series, the most-watched medical drama was &#8220;The Good Doctor,&#8221; which also topped this category in 2020. Other popular non-Original series included &#8220;Law &amp; Order: SVU&#8221; and &#8220;Modern Family.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian will use some of the $13.7 billion it raised when it publicly listed its shares to build a second factory in Georgia that has double the capacity of its plant in Illinois.</p>
<p>The company, which made the announced Thursday as part of its first earnings report, said the funds will be used to expand production capacity of its Normal, Illinois factory from 150,000 to 200,000 electric vehicles a year. Its second factory will be built east of Atlanta in Morgan and Walton counties and will have a targeted annual production capacity of 400,000 vehicles a year.</p>
<p>This Georgia factory will include a co-located battery cell production. Construction will begin in summer 2022 with production beginning in 2024. The company <a href="https://assets.rivian.com/2md5qhoeajym/3BYl8sLO3rzD9lluEwvXGE/754d4115dc0715d7e95e848556fc93cb/Rivian-Q3-2021-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">said in its shareholder letter</a> that it picked the site due to the combination of sustainable business operations, talent pool, and proximity to supply chain and logistics.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249025" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;As we look ahead, our Georgia facility will be critically important to our objective to accelerate the large-scale adoption of sustainable transportation,&#8221; the letter said, adding that the facility will be used for our next generation of vehicles.</p>
<p>In the near-term, that capital will also be used to design and develop its next generation of vehicles. To date, Rivian has three vehicles: the R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which are aimed at consumers, and its commercial van. Amazon, which holds more than 20% of Rivian stock, is the company&#8217;s first commercial van customer with an initial 100,000 vehicle order.</p>
<p>Rivian will also invest heavily in vertical integration, which follows the company and its founder and CEO RJ Scaringe&#8217;s strategy over the past several years. Specifically, Rivian intends to invest in battery technology across the value chain, including battery cell chemistry development, raw material sourcing, and in-house cell manufacturing, the company said in its shareholder letter. A look at one graphic in its shareholder letter illustrates those vertical integration ambitions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2249116" style="width: 1414px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-16-at-2.35.54-PM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2249116" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2249116 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-16-at-2.35.54-PM.png" alt="Rivian shareholder Q3 earnings" width="1404" height="814" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-16-at-2.35.54-PM.png 1404w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-16-at-2.35.54-PM.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-16-at-2.35.54-PM.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-16-at-2.35.54-PM.png?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-16-at-2.35.54-PM.png?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-16-at-2.35.54-PM.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1404px) 100vw, 1404px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2249116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Rivian</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The electric drive system will be another investment priority, according to the shareholder letter. The aim, the company said, is to advance its &#8220;in-house family of future drive units offering higher performance, improved packaging, and lower cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Generating sales is of course at the top of the to-do list, which Rivian plans to increase by continuing to invest in customer engagement and experiences, including its &#8220;experience spaces,&#8221; the Rivian membership program for consumers and its digital fleet management software that is branded FleetOS for its commercial customers.</p>
<p>Rivian outlined plans to build out its vehicle service and charging infrastructure. By the end of the year, Rivian said it will have more than 60 mobile service vans in service and eight service centers located in California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, Utah, and Washington.</p>
