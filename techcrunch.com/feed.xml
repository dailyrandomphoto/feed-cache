										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the United States, a 401(k) plan is an employer-sponsored defined-contribution pension account. However, with legacy institutional investing, most of these have at least some level of fossil fuel involvement and let‚Äôs face it, very few of us really know. Now a startup plans to change that.</p>
<p>California-based startup <a href="http://oursphere.org">Sphere</a> wants to get employees to ask their employers for investment options that are not invested in fossil fuels. To do that it‚Äôs offering financial products that make it easier &#8211; it says &#8211; for employers to offer fossil-free investment options in their 401(k) plans. This could be quite a big movement. Sphere says there are over $35 trillion in assets in retirement savings in the US as of Q1 2021.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs now raised a $2M funding round led by climatetech-focused VC Pale Blue Dot led the investment round. Also participating were climate-focused investors including Sundeep Ahuja of Climate Capital. Sphere is also a registered ‚ÄòPublic Benefit Corporation‚Äô allowing it to campaign in public about climate change.</p>
<p>Alex Wright-Gladstein, CEO and founder of Sphere said: ‚ÄúWe are proud to be partnering with Pale Blue Dot on our mission to reverse climate change by making our money talk. Heidi, Hampus, and Joel have the experience and drive to help us make big changes on the short 7 year time scale that we have to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C.‚Äù Wright-Gladstein has also teamed up with sustainable investing veteran Jason Britton of Reflection Asset Management and BITA custom indexes.</p>
<p>Wright-Gladstein said she learned the difficulty of offering fossil-free options in 401(k) plans when running her previous startup, Ayar Labs. She tried to offer a fossil-free option for employees, but found out it took would take three years to get a single fossil-free option in the plan.</p>
<p>Heidi Lindvall, General Partner at Pale Blue Dot said: ‚ÄúWe are big believers in Sphere&#8217;s unique approach of raising awareness through a social movement while offering a range of low-cost products that address the structural issues in fossil-free 401(k) investing.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last month, Twitch users have become increasingly concerned and frustrated with bot-driven hate raids. To protest Twitch&#8217;s lack of immediate action to prevent targeted harassment of marginalized creators, some streamers are going dark to observe #ADayOffTwitch today.</p>
<p>Per the protest, users are sharing a <a href="https://twitter.com/LuciaEverblack/status/1432749839641632775">list of demands</a> for the Amazon-owned Twitch. They want the platform to host a roundtable with creators affected by hate raids, allow streamers to approve or deny incoming raids, enable tools to only allow accounts of a certain age to chat, remove the ability to attach more than three accounts to one email address, and share a timeframe for when comprehensive anti-harassment tools will be implemented.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey friendos, I won‚Äôt be streaming tomorrow in support of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADayOffTwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ADayOffTwitch</a>. (Here‚Äôs a handy graphic of some of the things those protesting are asking of <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Twitch</a> in case you‚Äôre not familiar with what‚Äôs going on.) I‚Äôll be back on Thursday for our first swing at Senior Detective! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="üíú" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/OA9NQlTnq3">pic.twitter.com/OA9NQlTnq3</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Meg Turney (@megturney) <a href="https://twitter.com/megturney/status/1432876805678116864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>TechCrunch asked Twitch if it has plans to address these demands. Twitch responded with a statement: &#8220;We support our streamers‚Äô rights to express themselves and bring attention to important issues across our service. No one should have to experience malicious and hateful attacks based on who they are or what they stand for, and we are working hard on improved channel-level ban evasion detection and additional account improvements to help make Twitch a safer place for creators.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twitch </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/20/twitch-unveils-a-suite-of-new-tools-to-help-creators-grow-their-channels-and-make-money/">Raids</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> are a part of the streaming platform&#8217;s culture &#8212; after one creator ends their stream, they can &#8220;raid&#8221; another stream by sending their viewers over to check out someone else&#8217;s channel. This feature is supposed to help more seasoned streamers support up-and-comers, but instead, it&#8217;s been weaponized as a tool for harassment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In May, Twitch launched 350 new tags related to gender, sexual orientation, race and ability, which users </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310210-discover/suggestions/37011022-trans-tag-request">requested</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> so that they could more easily find creators that represent them. But at the same time, these tags made it easier for bad actors to harass marginalized streamers, and Twitch hasn&#8217;t yet added tools for streamers to deal with increased harassment. In the meantime, Twitch users have had to take matters into their own hands and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools">build their own safety tools</a> to protect themselves while Twitch works on its updates. Twitch hasn&#8217;t shared when its promised anti-harassment tools will go live.¬†¬†</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As recently as December, Twitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/twitch-updates-its-hateful-content-and-harassment-policy-after-company-called-out-for-its-ownabuses/">updated its policies</a> on hateful content and harassment, which the platform said have always been prohibited, yet vicious attacks have continued. After facing targeted, racist hate raids on their streams, a Black Twitch creator <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rekitraven">RekItRaven</a> started the #TwitchDoBetter hashtag on Twitter in early August, calling out Twitch for its failure to prevent this abuse. While Twitch is aware of the issue and said it&#8217;s working on solutions, <a href="https://www.change.org/p/amazon-twitch-do-better-stop-hate-raids-against-people-of-color-and-marginalized-creators?recruiter=60679039&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;utm_term=share_petition&amp;recruited_by_id=cdf10ce0-f224-0130-2417-0022190c02ea">many users</a> find Twitch&#8217;s response to be too slow and lacking.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve been building channel-level ban evasion detection and account improvements to combat this malicious behavior for months. However, as we work on solutions, bad actors work in parallel to find ways around them‚Äîwhich is why we can&#39;t always share details.</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitch (@Twitch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1428814017779306499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Along with streamers LuciaEverblack and ShineyPen, RekItRaven organized #ADayOffTwitch to put pressure on Twitch to make its platform safer for marginalized creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate on the platform is not new,&#8221; Raven told <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/black-content-creators-organize-one_day-boycott-against-twitch">WYNC&#8217;s The Takeaway</a>. But bot-driven raid attacks are more difficult to combat than individual trolls. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had people come in with bots. It&#8217;s usually one or two people who program a bunch of bots, you bypass security measures that are put in place and just spam a broadcaster&#8217;s chat with very inflammatory, derogatory language.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Raven said they have since had a discussion with Twitch, they don&#8217;t feel that one conversation is enough.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Turns out a bunch of LGBTQUIA2+, BIPOC, Disabled, Neurodivergent, and Plural creators really can make a difference by showing up, being loud, and not backing down despite people telling us we won&#39;t accomplish anything.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>As part of #ADayOffTwitch, some streamers are encouraging their followers to support them financially on other platforms through the #SubOffTwitch tag. Twitch takes 50% of streamers&#8217; revenue, so creators are promoting their accounts on platforms like Patreon and Ko-Fi, which take a much smaller cut. Though competitor YouTube Gaming takes 30% of revenue, and Facebook Gaming <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/facebook-no-creator-revenue-split-2023-zuckerberg-1234990191/">won&#8217;t take a cut from creators</a> until 2023, Twitch remains dominant in the streaming space. According to Streamlabs and Stream Hatchet, Twitch <a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492">represented 72.3%</a> of the market share in terms of viewership Q1 2021.</p>
<p>Still, popular creators like Ben Lupo (DrLupo), Jack Dunlop (CouRage), and Rachell Hofstetter (Valkyrae) have recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal">left Twitch</a> for exclusive deals with YouTube Gaming. If Twitch remains unsafe for marginalized creators, others might be swayed to follow their lead, exclusive deals or not.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company provided me with the Ubco 2X2 Adventure Bike for nearly a month, which gave me plenty of time to put it to the test.¬†]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A recent move to Auckland, New Zealand ‚Äî a city with lackluster public transit and hills that can turn a quick bike ride to the store into a sweaty workout ‚Äî piqued my interest in e-bikes.</p>
<p>Strong demand and skyrocketing prices, however, made it difficult to access these coveted e-bikes here in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa">Land of the Long White Cloud</a>. That changed after learning about Ubco, the New Zealand-based electric utility bike startup that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/electric-utility-bike-startup-ubco-raises-10-million-to-fund-its-global-expansion/">raised $10 million</a> from investors.</p>
<p>The company provided me with the Ubco 2X2 Adventure Bike for nearly a month, which gave me plenty of time to put it to the test.</p>
<p>I may not be Ubco‚Äôs target audience, although I did my best to use the bike as its design suggests, and packed it up with bags of books and other heavy things that might simulate the weight of delivered garlic bread, mail and other packages. The Ubco 2X2 Adventure Bike is made for city utility riding, with the option of going off-road, which I would later try with gusto.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s flagship is the Ubco 2X2 Work Bike, an electric dirt bike that was originally designed to help farmers. The fresh capital the company raised in June will be used to expand into existing verticals like food delivery, postal service and last-mile logistics, scale a commercial subscription business and target sales growth in the United States.</p>
<p>Domino‚Äôs drivers in Auckland, and I hear in the U.K., can be seen delivering hot pizzas on Ubco bikes, and the company has a range of other national clients, like the New Zealand Post, the Defense Force, the Department of Conservation, and PƒÅmu, or Landcorp Farming Limited, as well as other local restaurants and stores.</p>

<h2>The handoff</h2>
<p>CEO and co-founder Timothy Allan drove out from the company headquarters in Tauranga to hand off the bike personally. It was a sunny day in my neighborhood, and I listened impatiently as he described the various bits and bobs, how to work the machine and how to charge it.</p>
<p>Allan helped me download the Ubco app to pair my phone with the bike, which, among other functionalities, allowed me to select beginner mode, which would cap the vehicle speed at around 20 miles per hour. I made a mental note so that I could write about it here, but was determined to reach the top speed of 30 miles per hour right away.</p>
<p>I did, and it was ‚Ä¶ pretty sick. I‚Äôm not supposed to gush, but man! It‚Äôs a sweet ride. Here‚Äôs why:</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>The Adventure Bike comes standard in white and sits on 17&#215;2.75-inch multiuse tires with aluminum rims, both of which are DOT compliant. My version also had Maori decals on the frame, in a nod to the indigenous people of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The bike‚Äôs height is about 41 inches and the seat comes to 32 inches. From wheel to wheel, it‚Äôs about 72 inches. The payload, including the rider, is about 330 pounds, so both my partner (6‚Äô2‚Äù man) and I (5‚Äô7‚Äù female) rode this bike with ease, needing only to adjust the wide rearview mirrors sticking out of the handlebars. And no, we didn‚Äôt ride it together. This bike is designed as a one-seater.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187584" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187584" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187584 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6049.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187584" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rebecca Bellan</p></div></p>
<p>That said, there‚Äôs a little cargo rack above the back wheel, which holds the license plate (apparently these are classified as mopeds, which require registration in many places) and any other cargo one might carry. I didn‚Äôt try, but I reckon it could hold at least five pizza boxes tied down with a bungee cord. The bike rack also allows for saddlebags to be strapped on. Ubco sells what it calls the Pannier Back Pack, a weather-resistant roll-top cargo bag, for $189 that slots in very nicely and is actually a quality bag with 5.28-gallon capacity.</p>
<p>Accessories aside, the alloy frame is lightweight and step-through, which I love in a bike &#8212; it lets me start to shift myself off before I fully park and I feel super agile and swift. Speaking of parking, the rules are different everywhere, I assume, but here, you park it on the street or in parking spaces, not on the sidewalk. It‚Äôs got a kickstand to hold it in place, and you can lock the front wheel so no one can just wheel it away. They <i>could,</i> however, probably chuck it into the back of their pickup truck if they so chose, since it‚Äôs only 145 pounds.</p>
<p>The appearance of the bike stood out, and not just to me. During my multiweek test drive, numerous tradesmen and bike folks went out of their way to compliment its design, the exact demographic that Ubco is aiming for.</p>
<h2>Rideability</h2>
<p>The lightness of the bike means that it‚Äôs easy to take off and find your balance. The battery is also in the middle of the frame, just near where your feet sit, which anchors the bike and gives you a stable center of gravity.</p>
<p>The lightweight nature of the bike is a blessing and a curse. Cutting a turn is easy, but on a windy day and an open road, there were moments I worried that I‚Äôd be knocked off it &#8212; but maybe that had more to do with riding next to a 10-wheeler on the street. Because it‚Äôs so light, it did feel a bit strange to me to be in the street lane with the other bigger, meaner cars rather than in the bike lanes.</p>
<p>The bike accelerates quickly via the fully electronic throttle control, even up steep hills, due to the high torque geared drivetrain. The drivetrain has two 1 kw Flux2 motors with sealed bearings, active heat management and active venting for residual moisture &#8212; a necessity in this moistest of cities.</p>
<p>The acceleration sound, which mimics those of a gas-powered dirt bike but with a softer electronic tone, was a surprising plus. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I relied on my sense of sound to tell how fast I was going until I rode the Ubco.</p>
<p>The braking system was a bit touchy. It felt very sensitive to me, probably because hydraulic and regenerative brakes are operating together on the vehicle. There‚Äôs also a passive regenerative braking system, which I gather is what put the brakes on for me when I was just trying to coast down one of those mammoth hills.</p>

<p>Both the front suspension, 130 mm, and rear suspension, 120 mm, have a coil spring with a hydraulic dampener and have preload and rebound adjustment. In other words, the shocks are awesome. Even when I actively drove myself off sidewalks and over speed bumps, I could barely feel a thing.</p>
<p>To test its off-road capabilities, I took the bike to Cornwall Park, where I ran it at full speed on the grass, swerving between trees, flying over roots and rocks, doing doughnuts in the field. It was good fun and I felt completely in control of the vehicle. I can imagine why farmers have turned to the Work Bike.</p>
<p>When it was time to test out its use as a delivery bike, I packed the two saddlebags with books and groceries and took it for a spin. Still a great ride, although I was a little wobbly turning corners until I got the hang of it.</p>
<h2>Value</h2>
<p>Since the Ubco Adventure Bike doesn‚Äôt neatly fit into a specific bike category, it‚Äôs not a simple price comparison. An electric moped, like a Lexmoto Yadea or a Vespa Elettrica, could set you back anywhere from $2,400 or $7,000, respectively. Electric dirt bikes could cost anywhere from $6,000 to $11,000 for something like a KTM or Alta Motors.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the Ubco Adventure Bike costs $6,999 with a 2.1 kW power supply and $7,499 for a 3.1 kW power supply. Depending on what you want it for, I&#8217;d say it‚Äôs somewhere around mid-range for a bike like this. Since you&#8217;d probably use it for work-related activities, it could get a tax write-off. Plus, you want quality in a bike that‚Äôs down to do some heavy lifting, and Ubco has plenty of that. It‚Äôs not only a handy utility bike, but it‚Äôs also got some excellent tech under the proverbial hood, which we‚Äôll get to later.</p>
<p>Ubco estimates a 10- to 15-year life expectancy, depending on use. Over-the-air software updates, replacing parts and full refurbishments can help keep the bike going for longer. The company encourages riders to send back the dead bikes because it&#8217;s committed to full product stewardship.</p>
<p>That said, if you wanted to buy a bike now, it‚Äôd be a preorder (unless your local Ubco dealer had some in stock). Ordering now could get you an Ubco by September if you live in the States. The company says it‚Äôs still feeling the effects of COVID, with high demand and a stretched supply chain causing delays. The preorder requires a $1,000 deposit.</p>
<p>Ubco also has a subscription model, which is mainly available for enterprise customers at the moment and priced on a case-by-case basis. However, it&#8217;s piloting subscriptions for individuals in Auckland and Tauranga before rolling the program out globally. Subscriptions will start at around NZD $300 per month for a 36-month term.</p>
<h2>Range</h2>
<p>The Adventure Bike comes with either the 2.1 kWh battery pack, which has around 40 to 54 miles of range, or the 3.1 kWh, with 60 to 80 miles.</p>
<p>The battery is run off a management system, called &#8220;Scotty,&#8221; to monitor real-time performance and safety. The battery, which is sealed with alloy and vented during use, is made with 18650 lithium-ion cells, which means it‚Äôs a powerful battery that can handle up to 500 charging cycles. Ubco says its batteries are designed to be disassembled at the end of life.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2187590" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2187590" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2187590 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6055.jpeg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6055.jpeg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6055.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6055.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6055.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6055.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6055.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6055.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6055.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2187590" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rebecca Bellan</p></div></p>
<p>The 10 amp alloy fast charger can fuel the battery fully within four to six hours. You can charge it while it‚Äôs still in the vehicle by just connecting it to a power outlet, or you can unlock the battery and yank it out (it‚Äôs a little heavy) and charge it inside. Note: Charging is loud. Not sure if this is standard, but probably is.</p>
<p>I charged it every two to three days, but that will depend on use and where you are. It‚Äôs winter in Auckland, so a bit cold, which affects battery life, and the hills are brutal, which also use up a lot of battery life.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd ride it downtown and around my neighborhood every day, but I‚Äôd wager a delivery driver would need to charge it nightly. As I mentioned earlier, the battery can be removed for charging, so if you take it to work, you can always take it up to the office or wherever to charge while you‚Äôre doing other things.</p>
<h2>Tech features</h2>
<h3>Vehicle management system</h3>
<p>The vehicle runs off what Ubco calls its Cerebro vehicle management system, which integrates all electronic and electrical functions of the vehicles and provides control and updates via Bluetooth. Ubco builds with end of life in mind, so the CAN bus is isolated so future CAN devices can be easily integrated.</p>
<p>Now, one of my first questions, given the heftiness of this bike and the likelihood of gig economy workers who would ride it for work living in urban dwellings, was this: How can I ensure no one will steal this thing when it‚Äôs on the street, because there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm lugging it up to my fifth-floor walkup?</p>
<p>Like I said, you can lock the wheel in place, which would make it far more difficult for someone to wheel it off. If someone did decide to capture the whole cumbersome vehicle, Ubco would be able to track it for you. Each Ubco bike has telemetry, aka a SIM card, hardwired inside, and that can help provide data that can be used for location, servicing, theft, safety, route planning, etc.</p>
<p>This VMS architecture is made for handling fleets via Ubco‚Äôs enterprise subscription vehicles, but it obviously has other uses, like providing peace of mind (personally, I‚Äôd still lock it up with chains, but I‚Äôm a New Yorker and trust no one). Obviously, if you think this telemetry is creepy, you can opt out, but it does come standard with subscriptions, allowing subscribers to track their bike&#8217;s location on the app.</p>

<p>Mounted on the handlebar is an LCD display that shows speed, power levels and more. Also on the handlebars are switch controls for high or low beams, indicators and a horn. I found the indicators to be a bit sticky and sometimes I would slip and hit the horn. What I <i>wish</i> the handlebars also had was a mount for your phone so you could follow directions. I had my headphones in and was listening to Google Maps tell me how to get around, but that felt less safe and efficient.</p>
<h3>Turning it on</h3>
<p>You can turn the power on with a keyless fob by either clicking the button on the fob or the button on the handlebars. I will note that the keyless fob button is weirdly sensitive. At multiple points, I had it in my pocket with my phone or other pocket inhabitants and it must have knocked into the button, turning the vehicle off while I was riding it. Thankfully, that never happened anywhere busy, but that‚Äôs something to be wary about.</p>
<h3>App</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, you could pair your phone, as well as other users&#8217; phones, to the bike using the app. The app allows you to choose learner mode or restricted mode, which controls ride settings; turn the bike and lights on and off; change the metrics; and check the status of things like battery life, speed and motor temperature. It&#8217;s basically all the info on the dash, but on an app. I didn&#8217;t really feel the need to use it.</p>
<h3>Lights</h3>
<p>The LED headlights are on at all times when the vehicle is turned on, but there&#8217;s also a high and low beam, as well as peripheral parking lights, all of which are designed for disassembly at the end of life. There are also LED rear, brake and number plate lights, as well as DOT-approved indicator lights.</p>
<h2>Other stuff</h2>
<p>Among the features that don‚Äôt fit neatly into the other categories, there‚Äôs the field kit, which is fastened to the lift-up seat and contains a user manual and tools to set up and maintain the 2X2, which is really handy. Usually, when people buy an Ubco bike, it comes in a box and there are ‚Äúa few simple steps to follow to get it ready to ride.‚Äù There‚Äôs also an <a href="https://www.ubcouniversity.com/courses/how-to-set-up-your-new-2x2-2021-wrk-adv-bikes">UBCO University</a>¬†course that shows how to set it up. If you buy from one of Ubco‚Äôs dealers, they‚Äôll unpack it and set it up when you come to collect it.</p>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>Maintenance comes with the cost of a monthly subscription. Ubco has a network of technicians placed wherever the company sells its bikes if they&#8217;re in need of fixing. If there&#8217;s no authorized mechanic nearby, Ubco&#8217;s head office will work with customers to help them fix the bike. Ubco did not respond to information about how many authorized mechanics are in its network.</p>
<p>Again, being from New York, I&#8217;ve seen probably thousands of delivery riders on bikes and mopeds, oven mitts covered in a plastic bag taped onto the handlebars so drivers can keep their hands warm during the colder months. This bike can handle a hefty load for delivering goods, it&#8217;s quick and agile for weaving in and out of traffic, and it&#8217;s easy to ride and use.</p>
<p>The subscription offering, especially for enterprise, makes this a great city utility bike that can probably handle a range of weather conditions. I already know it can handle rain and mud, so all signs point to success in the sloshy, icy hell of a Northern city winter. And for the adventurer &#8212; the person who just wants to ride something sweet on- and off-road, out of the city and into the wilderness &#8212; this is also a great consumer ride that will last you quite a while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sec/">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> has fined several brokerage firms a total of $750,000 for exposing the sensitive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/personally-identifiable-information/">personally identifiable information</a> of thousands of customers and clients after hackers took over employee email accounts.</p>
<p>A total of eight entities belonging to three companies have been sanctioned by the SEC, including Cetera (Advisor Networks, Investment Services, Financial Specialists, Advisors, and Investment Advisers), Cambridge Investment Research (Investment Research and Investment Research Advisors), and KMS Financial Services.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-169">a press release</a>, the SEC announced that it had sanctioned the firms for failures in their cybersecurity policies and procedures that allowed hackers to gain unauthorized access to cloud-based email accounts, exposing the personal information of thousands of customers and clients at each firm</p>
<p>In the case of Cetera, the SEC said that cloud-based email accounts of more than 60 employees were infiltrated by unauthorized third parties for more than three years, exposing at least 4,388 clients&#8217; personal information.</p>
<p>The order states that none of the accounts featured the protections required by Cetera‚Äôs policies, and the SEC also charged two of the Cetera entities with sending breach notifications to clients containing ‚Äúmisleading language suggesting that the notifications were issued much sooner than they actually were after discovery of the incidents.‚Äù</p>
<p>The SEC‚Äôs order against Cambridge concludes that the personal information exposure of at least 2,177 Cambridge customers and clients was the result of lax <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> practices at the firm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p>‚ÄúAlthough Cambridge discovered the first email account takeover in January 2018, it failed to adopt and implement firm-wide enhanced security measures for cloud-based email accounts of its representatives until 2021, resulting in the exposure and potential exposure of additional customer and client records and information,‚Äù the SEC said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p>The order against KMS is similar; the SEC&#8217;s order states that the data of almost 5,000 customers and clients were exposed as a result of the company‚Äôs failure to adopt written policies and procedures requiring additional firm-wide security measures until May 2020.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Investment advisers and broker-dealers must fulfill their obligations concerning the protection of customer information,&#8221; said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division&#8217;s Cyber Unit. &#8220;It is not enough to write a policy requiring enhanced security measures if those requirements are not implemented or are only partially implemented, especially in the face of known attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of the parties agreed to resolve the charges and to not commit future violations of the charged provisions, without admitting or denying the SEC‚Äôs findings. As part of the settlements, Cetera will pay a penalty of $300,000, while Cambridge and KMS will pay fines of $250,000 and $200,000 respectively. <span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p>Cambridge told TechCrunch that it does not comment on regulatory matters, but said it has and does maintain a comprehensive information security group and procedures to ensure clients&#8217; accounts are fully protected. Cetera and KMS have yet to respond.</p>
<p>This latest action by the SEC comes just weeks after the Commission ordered London-based publishing and education giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/pearson-to-pay-1m-fine-for-misleading-investors-about-2018-data-breach/">Pearson to¬†pay a $1 million fine for misleading investors about a 2018 data breach</a>¬†at the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.forumbrands.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forum Brands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an e-commerce acquisition platform, announced today that it has secured $100 million in debt funding from </span><a href="https://www.triplepointcapital.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TriplePoint Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing comes just just over two months after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the startup raised $27 million in an equity funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brenton Howland, Ruben Amar and Alex Kopco founded New York-based Forum Brands in the summer of 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre buying what we think are A+ high-growth e-commerce businesses that sell predominantly on Amazon and are looking to build a portfolio of standalone businesses that are category leaders, on and off Amazon,‚Äù Howland told me at the time of the company‚Äôs last raise. ‚ÄúA source of inspiration for us is that we saw how consumer goods and services changed fundamentally for what we think is going to be for decades and decades to come, accelerating the shift toward digital.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we covered the company in June, Forum Brands says it has acquired several new brands, including </span><a href="https://bonzapet.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a seller of pet products, and</span><a href="https://simkarose.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Simka Rose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a baby-focused brand specializing in eco-friendly products. Simka sells in the U.S. and the EU and is an example of how Forum is expanding globally, Amar said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howland and Amar emphasize that the Forum team continues to focus on quality over quantity when evaluating potential acquisitions. Although they meet with 15-20 founders a week, they are selective in which companies they choose to acquire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe continue to be a quality-first buyer, and not quantity-driven,‚Äù Amar said, noting that the company will still help a company build its brand even if it does not yet meet Forum‚Äôs quality threshold or if the founders are just not yet ready to sell.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new funds will be used to, naturally, acquire more e-commerce companies. As part of the debt financing, Sajal Srivastava, co-CEO and co-founder of TriplePoint Capital, will be joining Forum‚Äôs board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe are impressed not only by Forum‚Äôs long-term strategy and ability to leverage technology and deep collective e-commerce and M&amp;A experience but also by how Forum cultivates relationships with their sellers both before and after partnering with them,‚Äù he said in a written statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is launching a new version of its <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/">Chrome Beta browser</a> today that&#8217;s introducing some fairly notable changes to its user interface and design. The browser will introduce an updated New Tab page, which will now include cards directing you back to past web search activities, instead of only a list of shortcuts to favorite websites. Other changes aim to make it easier to navigate search results and to highlight and share quotes from the web.</p>
<p>The New Tab page&#8217;s update will be one of the first changes Chrome beta users may notice.</p>
<p>The idea behind this design change is about getting you back quickly to past web activities without a need dive into your browsing history to remember which sites you had been using for things like recipes or shopping. It can also help you to return quickly to your recent documents list in Google Drive, in a handy bit of cross-promotion for Google services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196948" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196948" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196948" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png 2250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=1536,929 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=2048,1239 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Docs_Module_Desktop.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196948" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The page will now feature what Google is calling &#8220;cards,&#8221; not just links, which could direct you to things like a recently-visited recipe site where you had been browsing for ideas, a Google doc you need to finish editing, or a retailer&#8217;s website where you had left your shopping cart filled with things you may like to purchase at a later date. The latter ties into Google&#8217;s larger investment in online shopping, which has already seen the search giant trying to grab more marketshare in the space by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/">making product listings free</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">partnering with e-commerce platforms like Shopify.</a></p>
<p>Google is rightly concerned about Amazon&#8217;s surging advertising business, which is a large part of the retailer&#8217;s &#8220;Other&#8221; category that grew <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazons-advertising-business-surging-amid-industry-wide-ad-sales-boom-tech-giants/">87% year-over-year</a> to generate $7.9 billion in the second quarter. Now, it&#8217;s capitalizing on Chrome&#8217;s New Tab real estate to elevate shopping activity in the hopes of pushing users to complete their transactions.</p>
<p>Another change aims to make it easier to do web research. Google says that often, users searching for something on its platform will navigate to multiple web pages to find their answer. The new version of Chrome will experiment with a different way of connecting users to their search results by adding a row beneath the address bar on Chrome for Android that will show the rest of the results so you can navigate to other web pages without needing to hit the back button.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2196952" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196952" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Webnotes_Mobile.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196952" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>A new &#8220;quote cards&#8221; experiment, also coming to Chrome Beta on Android, will allow users to create a stylized image for social sharing that features text found on websites. Taking a screengrab of a website&#8217;s text is something that&#8217;s already a common activity, and particularly for people who want to share a key point from a news article they&#8217;re reading with followers on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. With this new feature, you&#8217;ll be able to long press text to highlight it, then tap Share and select a template by tapping on the &#8220;Create Card&#8221; option from the menu.</p>
<p>All features are a part of the Chrome Beta browser. To enable experiments, you can type <em>chrome://flags</em> into the browser&#8217;s address bar or click on the Experiments beaker icon, and then enable the flags. The associated flags for these experiments are #ntp-modules flag (New Tab page), #continuous-search (search results changes), and #webnotes-stylize flag (quote cards).</p>
<p>Experiments don&#8217;t necessarily become Chrome features that roll out more broadly. Instead, they offer Google a way to capture large-scale user feedback about its new design ideas, so the features can be tweaked and fine-tuned before a public release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s newest test could provide some long-awaited relief for anyone facing harassment on the platform.</p>
<p>The new product test introduces a feature called &#8220;Safety Mode&#8221; that puts up a temporary line of defense between an account and the waves of toxic invective that Twitter is notorious for. The mode can be enabled from the settings menu, which toggles on an algorithmic screening process that filters out potential abuse that lasts for seven days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of Tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks,&#8221; Twitter Product Lead Jarrod Doherty said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2196998" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sm.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Safe Mode won&#8217;t be rolling out broadly ‚Äî not yet, anyway. The new feature will first be available to what Twitter describes as a &#8220;small feedback group&#8221; of about 1,000 English language users.</p>
<p>In deciding what to screen out, Twitter&#8217;s algorithmic approach assesses a tweet&#8217;s content ‚Äî hateful language, repetitive, unreciprocated mentions ‚Äî as well as the relationship between an account and the accounts replying. The company notes that accounts you follow or regularly exchange tweets with won&#8217;t be subject to the blocking features in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>For anyone in the test group, Safety Mode can be toggled on in the privacy and safety options. Once enabled, an account will stay in the mode for the next seven days. After the seven day period expires, it can be activated again.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In crafting the new feature, Twitter says it spoke with experts in mental health, online safety and human rights. The partners Twitter consulted with were able to contribute to the initial test group by nominating accounts that might benefit from the feature, and the company hopes to focus on female journalists and marginalized communities in its test of the new product. Twitter says that it will start reaching out to accounts that meet the criteria of the test group ‚Äî namely accounts that often find¬†themselves on the receiving end of some of the platform&#8217;s worst impulses.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Twitter announced that it was working on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/"> developing new anti-abuse features</a>, including an option to let users &#8220;unmention&#8221; themselves from tagged threads and a way for users to prevent serial harassers from mentioning them moving forward. The company also hinted at a feature like Safety Mode that could give users a way to defuse situations during periods of escalating abuse.</p>
<p>Being &#8220;harassed off of Twitter&#8221; is, unfortunately, not that uncommon. When hate and abuse get bad enough, people tend to abandon Twitter altogether, taking extended breaks or leaving outright. That&#8217;s obviously not great for the company either, and while it&#8217;s been slow to offer real solutions to harassment, it&#8217;s obviously aware of the problem and working toward some possible solutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Goodcall‚Äôs free cloud-based conversational platform leverages artificial intelligence to manage incoming business phone calls and boost customer service while assisting to other patrons.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even without staffing shortages, local merchants have difficulty answering calls while all hands are busy, and <a href="https://goodcall.com">Goodcall</a> wants to alleviate some of that burden from America‚Äôs 30 million small businesses.</p>
<p>Goodcall‚Äôs free cloud-based conversational platform leverages artificial intelligence to manage incoming phone calls and boost customer service for businesses of all sizes. Former Google executive Bob Summers left Google back in January, where he was working on Area 120 ‚Äî an internal incubator program for experimental projects ‚Äî to start Goodcall after recognizing the call problem, noting that in fact 60% of the calls that come into merchants go unanswered.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frustrating for you and for the person calling,‚Äù Summers told TechCrunch. ‚ÄúEvery missed call is a lost opportunity.‚Äù</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Goodcall announced its launch Wednesday with $4 million in seed funding led by strategic investors Neo, Foothill Ventures, Merus Capital, Xoogler Ventures, Verissimo Ventures and VSC Ventures, as well as angel investors including Harry Hurst, founder and co-CEO of Pipe.com, and Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196344" style="width: 356px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196344" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2196344" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?w=346" alt="" width="346" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png 816w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=153,300 153w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=768,1510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=346,680 346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=781,1536 781w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile-Agent-settings.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196344" class="wp-caption-text">Goodcall mobile agent. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Goodcall</p></div></p>
<p>Restaurants, shops and merchants can set up on Goodcall in a matter of minutes and even establish a local phone number to free up an owner‚Äôs mobile number from becoming the business‚Äô main line. The service is initially deployed in English and the company has plans to operate in Spanish, French and Hindi by 2022.</p>
<p>Merchants can choose from six different assistant voices and monitor the call logs and what the calls were about. Goodcall can also capture consumer sentiment, Summers said.</p>
<p>The company offers three options, including its freemium service for solopreneurs and business owners, which includes up to 500 minutes per month of Goodcall services for a single phone line. Up to five additional locations and five staff members costs $19 per month for the Pro level, or the Premium level provides unlimited locations and staff for $49 per month.</p>
<p>During the company‚Äôs beta period, Goodcall was processing several thousands of calls per month. The new funding will be used to continue to offer the free service, hire engineers and continue product development.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding round, Goodcall is unveiling a partnership with Yelp to tap into its database of local businesses so that those owners and managers can easily deploy Goodcall. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/yelp-says-more-than-500000-new-businesses-opened-in-past-year.html">Yelp data shows</a> that more than 500,000 businesses opened during the pandemic. The company pulls in from Yelp a merchant‚Äôs open hours, location, if they offer Wi-Fi and even their COVID policy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are partnering with Yelp, which has the best data on small businesses, and other large distribution channels to get our product to market,‚Äù Summers said. ‚ÄúWe are bringing technology into an industry that hasn‚Äôt innovated since the 1980s and democratizing conversational AI for small businesses that are the main driver of job creation, and we want to help them grow.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Private equity firm Apollo Global Management this morning <a href="https://www.apollo.com/stockholders/press-releases/2021/09-01-2021-161530593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that it has completed its acquisition of Yahoo</a> (formerly known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/05/i-come-to-bury-oath/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verizon Media Group, itself formerly known as Oath)</a> from Verizon. The deal is worth $5 billion, with $4.25 billion in cash, plus preferred interests of $750 million. Verizon will be retaining 10% of the newly rebranded company.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a new era for Yahoo,‚Äù Yahoo CEO (and former VZM head) Guru Gowrappan said in a release tied to the news. ‚ÄúThe close of the deal heralds an exciting time of renewed opportunity for us as a standalone entity. We anticipate that the coming months and years will bring fresh growth and innovation for Yahoo as a business and a brand, and we look forward to creating that future with our new partners.‚Äù</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/verizon-media-leadership-in-doubt-ahead-of-apollo-acquisition-on-sept-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that Gowrappan might not stay on as CEO of Yahoo for the long term now that the deal has closed; for now he&#8217;s still at the helm.</p>
<p>In addition to its titular Yahoo properties (Mail, Sports, Finance, et al.), the group includes us, TechCrunch; AOL; Engadget and interactive media brand, RYOT. All told, the umbrella brand encompasses around 900 million monthly active users globally and is currently the third-largest internet property, per Apollo‚Äôs figures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deal puts to a close a years-long effort by Verizon to make a comprehensive move into online media, specifically around adtech, which ultimately proved to be too costly, mostly unprofitable, and finally not core enough to the telco&#8217;s bigger growth strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news comes during a tumultuous time for online media, amid increasing industry-wide consolidation, many felt within Verizon Media. Verizon acquired AOL in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-its-acquisition-of-aol-for-4-4b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 for $4.4 billion</a>, followed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/verizon-closes-4-5b-acquisition-of-yahoo-marissa-mayer-resigns-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying Yahoo for $4.5 billion two years later</a>, combining the two legacy media properties into a combined group named Oath. At the end of 2018, Oath wrote down $4.6 billion, following the merger.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how a new owner will steer that large ship differently, but one strategy &#8212; standard practice for PE firms &#8212; could involve Apollo selling off parts of the business or rationalizing it in other ways.</p>
<p>However, for its part, Apollo has promised to continue investing in the newly acquired proprieties, and it has secured all jobs at the time of handover for at least an initial period. The bigger firm of Apollo has a massive set of TMT holdings so it will be interesting to see how and if it leverages that, too.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe look forward to partnering with Yahoo&#8217;s talented employee base to build on the company&#8217;s strong momentum and position the new Yahoo for long-term success as a standalone consumer internet and digital media leader,‚Äù Apollo Partner Reed Rayman said in the release. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt be more excited about this next chapter for Yahoo as we look to invest in growth across the business, including accelerating its customer-first offerings and commerce capabilities, expanding its reach and enhancing the daily user experience.‚Äù</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Blueprint CEO Steve Berneman thinks that the $18 billion title insurance business should really be a $10 billion market. It was, we believe, the first time a startup discussed shrinking its market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://blueprinttitle.com/">Blueprint Title</a>, an insurtech startup working in the title insurance space, announced this morning that it closed a $16 million Series B. The new round was led by Fort√© Ventures. The startup previously raised an $8.5 million Series A in the final weeks of 2019.</p>
<p>While Blueprint is an insurtech startup and therefore fits into the neoinsurance cohort that we&#8217;ve tracked in recent quarters as a number of companies from the group have gone public, it&#8217;s somewhat distinct. Blueprint is different from the Roots and MetroMiles and Hippos that debuted via traditional IPOs or SPACs; it largely sells to business customers and has a very different product on offer.</p>
<p>The neoinsurance companies that went public in the last year and a half sell to consumers. Blueprint, in contrast, sells to professional groups looking for a better title insurance experience. That means its customer base is not made up of consumers hoping to cover their main residence, Blueprint CEO Steve Berneman told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>That means that the company&#8217;s go-to-market activities are distinct from its mates in the consumer-focused cohort and that its loss profile is very different.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eErw0xWi0F"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/embed/#?secret=eErw0xWi0F" data-secret="eErw0xWi0F" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Title insurance, Berneman said, has around a 1% to 4% claims rate, far lower than auto insurance, to pick an example. That means its risk profile is different, and its pricing less flexible; there&#8217;s less loss ratio to wring out of title insurance underwriting, so cost and delivery of service are even more important than in other insurance varietals.</p>
<p>According to the CEO, the title insurance market in the United States today is made up of four companies with around 90% market share. And thanks to rules requiring public pricing in many states, there&#8217;s alignment on pricing from some leading players. The result of market concentration and effective price harmonization is that Berneman thinks that the $18 billion title insurance business should really be a $10 billion market.</p>
<p>Our call with Blueprint was the first in which a startup discussed shrinking its market.</p>
<p>But the point is reasonable; if title insurance is mispriced, and Blueprint sells to corporate customers, it can likely offer profitable coverage at a lower-than-market price point &#8212; and grow quickly in the process. That appears to be the case, with the startup stating in a release that it anticipates 400% revenue growth in 2021 when compared to 2020.</p>
<p>That growth rate explains the Nashville-based company&#8217;s most recent round and what we presume was a stiff upsizing in its valuation.</p>
<p>As part of its funding round announcement, Blueprint also disclosed that it has purchased Southwest Land Title Insurance Company, an underwriting company. Berneman said that to shrink the title insurance market through more reasonable pricing, his company needs to be full-stack, i.e., both writing its own coverage and selling it. Otherwise, margins would leak on either side of its operations.</p>
<p>Blueprint, akin to Next Insurance, is a startup bet that selling insurance to business customers will prove to be a lucrative effort. Given that consumer-focused neoinsurance providers have seen Wall Street change its tune on their value, it will be interesting to watch this more B2B cohort grow and eventually debut.</p>

<p>Following our digs through recent IPO filings from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/inside-freshworks-ipo-filing-as-the/">Freshworks</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">Toast</a>, this morning we&#8217;re taking a spade to Amplitude&#8217;s document.</p>

We also want to understand how the company sees the future, because its product thesis is essentially a roadmap to its long-term growth; how investors value the company will in part hinge on whether Wall Street agrees with where Amplitude sees technology heading.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ll do our usual work to understand the company&#8217;s revenue mix and quality, wrapping with some noodling on what it may be worth. Sound fun? Good. Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>Amplitude&#8217;s core product thesis</h2>
<p>Most S-1 filings are full of corporate babble that I don&#8217;t drag you through. After all, we don&#8217;t <em>really</em> need to chat about how a particular vertical SaaS company thinks that its chosen niche is a great market. You already know what the debuting concern thinks. But with Amplitude, I want to do a bit more.</p>
<p>Amplitude sells what it calls &#8220;digital optimization&#8221; software. In practice, that means its software helps other companies design better software.</p>
<p>The company thinks that the way that digital products are built has changed. Gone are the days, in its view, of trusting intuition when it comes to digital design choices. Instead, Amplitude expects that companies with digital products will instead lean on data-driven decision-making. Or as it phrased it in its filing, digital product design is leaving the &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; phase for a more &#8220;Moneyball&#8221; era.</p>
<p>Data is at the core of how Amplitude sees companies designing future products. But in its view, many companies currently rely on a collection of disparate software tools to collect data on their digital footprint. Amplitude thinks it has a better method of collecting digital user data &#8212; and learning from it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many of us have not switched insurance carriers because we don‚Äôt want to deal with the hassle of comparison shopping?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot, I‚Äôd bet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://insurify.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that wants to help make it easier for people to get better rates on home, auto and life insurance, announced that it has closed $100 million in an ‚Äúoversubscribed‚Äù Series B funding round led by Motive Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Viola FinTech, MassMutual Ventures, Nationwide, Hearst Ventures and Moneta VC also put money in the round, as well as new investors Viola Growth and Fort Ross Ventures. With the new financing, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Insurify has now raised a total of $128 million since its 2013 inception. The company declined to disclose the valuation at which the money was raised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we last covered Insurify, the startup has seen some impressive growth. For example, it has seen its new and recurring revenue increase by ‚Äú6x‚Äù since it closed its Series A funding in the 2019 fourth quarter. Over the last three years, Insurify has achieved a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 151%, according to co-founder and CEO Snejina Zacharia. It has also seen consistent ‚Äú2.5x‚Äù year-over-year revenue growth, she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify has built a machine learning-based virtual insurance agent that integrates with more than 100 carriers to digitize &#8212; and personalize &#8212; the insurance shopping experience. There are others in the insurtech space, but none that we know of currently tackling home, auto </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life insurance. For example, Jerry, which has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/jerry-raises-75m-at-a-450m-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised capital twice</span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/ai-powered-jerry-raises-28m-to-help-you-save-money-on-car-insurance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is focused mostly on auto insurance, although it does have a home product. The Zebra, which </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/austins-newest-unicorn-insurtech-the-zebra-raises-150m-after-doubling-revenue-in-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">became a unicorn this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">started out as a site for people looking for auto insurance via its real-time quote comparison tool. Over time, it has also evolved to offer homeowners insurance with the goal of eventually branching out into renters and life insurance. But it too is mostly focused on auto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zacharia said that since Insurify‚Äôs Series A funding, it has expanded its home insurance marketplace, deepened its carrier integrations to provide users an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äúinstant‚Äù purchase experience and launched its first two embedded insurance products through partnerships with Toyota Insurance Management Solutions and Nationwide (the latter of which also participated in the Series B funding round).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, when SkyScanner had to lay off staff, Insurify scooped up much of its engineering team and established an office in Sofia, Bulgaria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zacharia, a former Gartner executive, was inspired to start the company after she was involved in a minor car accident while getting her MBA at MIT. The accident led to a spike in her insurance premium and Zacharia was frustrated by the ‚Äúcomplex and cumbersome‚Äù experience of car insurance shopping. She teamed up with Chief Product Officer Tod Kiryazov and her husband KAYAK President Giorgos Zacharia to build Insurify, which they describe as a virtual insurance agent that offers real-time quotes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe decided to build the most trusted virtual insurance agent in the industry that allows for customers to easily search, compare and buy fully digitally &#8212; directly from their mobile phone, or desktop, and really get a very smart, personalized experience based on their unique preferences,‚Äù Zacharia told TechCrunch. ‚ÄúWe leverage artificial intelligence to be able to make recommendations on both coverage as well as carrier selection.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Insurify is also a fully licensed agent that takes over the fulfillment and servicing of the policies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the company is mostly working as an insurance agent, it gets paid new and renewed commission. So while it‚Äôs not a SaaS business, its embedded insurance offerings have SaaS-like monetization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúOur goal is to provide an experience for the end consumer that allows them to service and manage all of their policies in one place, digitally,‚Äù Zacharia said. ‚ÄúWe think that the data recommendations that the platform provides can really remove most of the friction that currently exists in the shopping experience.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify plans to use its fresh capital to continue to expand its operations and accelerate its growth plans. It also, naturally, wants to add to its 125-person team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe want to build into our API integrations so customers can receive real-time direct quotes with better personalization and a more tailored experience,‚Äù Kiryazov said. ‚ÄúWe also want to identify more embedded insurance opportunities and expand the product functionality.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also down the line wants to expand into other verticals such as pet insurance, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurify intends to use the money in part to build brand awareness, potentially through TV advertising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAlmost half of our revenue comes from self-directed traffic,‚Äù Zacharia said. ‚ÄúSo we want to explore more inorganic growth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James ‚ÄúJim‚Äù O‚ÄôNeill, founding partner at Motive Partners and industry partner Andy Rear point out that o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nline purchasing now accounts for almost all of the growth in U.S. auto insurance.¬†</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe lesson from other markets which have been through this transition is that customers prefer choice, presented as a simple menu of products and prices from different insurers, and a straightforward online purchasing process,‚Äù they wrote via email. ‚ÄúThe U.S. auto market is huge: even a slow transition to online means a massive opportunity for Insurify.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conducting their due diligence, the pair said they were impressed with how the startup is building a business model ‚Äúthat works for customers, insurers and white-label partners.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harel Beit-On, founder and general partner at Viola Growth, believes that the quantum leap in e-commerce due to COVID-19 will completely transform the buying experience in almost every sector, including insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIt is time to bring the frictionless purchasing experience that customers expect to the insurance space as well,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFollowing our fintech fund&#8217;s recent investment in the company, we watched Insurify‚Äôs immense growth, excellent execution with customer acquisition and building a brand consumers trust.‚Äù</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/">Cox Automotive</a> is getting into the electric vehicle battery lifecycle business.</p>
<p>The company said Wednesday it acquired Oklahoma City-based <a href="http://www.spiersnewtechnologies.com/">Spiers New Technologies</a> (SNT), a business that provides repair, remanufacturing, refurbishing and repurposing services for EV battery packs.</p>
<p>The two companies did not disclose the terms of the deal. Cox said the acquisition will help it establish its battery servicing offerings, particularly as ‚ÄúEVs take center stage.‚Äù It added that electric vehicles have completely different service profiles than their internal combustion engine vehicle counterparts, and much of that comes down to the battery. EV battery support is particularly critical as the battery pack itself can comprise as much as 40% of the vehicle‚Äôs cost.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AZiR0QabiF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/">Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Giving EV batteries a second life for sustainability and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/giving-ev-batteries-a-second-life-for-sustainability-and-profit/embed/#?secret=AZiR0QabiF" data-secret="AZiR0QabiF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Even as federal investment in electric vehicles grow, and more automakers announce billions to build out their EV businesses, public skepticism remains. Eight out of 10 people not considering purchasing an EV are skeptical about the value of the battery and its useful life, according to research conducted by Cox.</p>
<p>This is not Cox‚Äôs only foray into EV battery management; the company also builds a battery health diagnostic tool with SNT that uses Spiers‚Äô software platform, Alfred. Cox said it would use the diagnostic tool to push greater confidence in electric vehicles, likening it to the way that Kelley Blue Book has provided greater transparency about ICE vehicles‚Äô condition for consumers.</p>
<p>The acquisition will also give Cox a stake in the battery repurposing business. Spiers is one of a few companies that specializes giving EV batteries a ‚Äúsecond life‚Äù after they are no longer fit for use in a vehicle. Around 80% to 90% of the batteries SNT receives are from OEMs, with the rest from auto dismantlers, the company told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year. It‚Äôs a business segment that is likely only to grow as more EVs come off the roads, so the transaction is likely giving Cox a stake in end-of-life purposes as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat.mx, which wants to build a real estate ‚Äúsuper app‚Äù for Latin America, has closed on a $20 million Series A round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthemis and 500 Startups co-led the investment, which included participation from ALLVP and Expa. Previously, Flat.mx had raised a total of $10 million in equity and $25 million in debt. Other backers include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/opendoor-to-go-public-by-way-of-chamath-palihapitiya-spac/">Opendoor</a> CEO and co-founder Eric Wu, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/homebuying-startup-flyhomes-closes-150-million-series-c/">Flyhomes‚Äô</a> co-founder and CEO Tushar Garg and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/divvy-homes-secures-110m-series-c-to-help-renters-become-homeowners/">Divvy Homes‚Äô</a> co-founder Brian Ma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in July 2019, Mexico City-based Flat.mx started out with a model similar to that of Opendoor, buying properties, renovating them and then reselling them. That September, the proptech startup had raised one of Mexico‚Äôs largest pre-seed rounds to take the Opendoor real estate marketplace model across the Rio Grande.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Flat, a Mexican property tech startup, raises $4.6M pre-seed led by ALLVP&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/05/flat-a-mexican-property-tech-startup-raises-4-6m-pre-seed-led-by-allvp/embed/#?secret=DXzMo6vWNW" data-secret="DXzMo6vWNW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe real estate market in Mexico is broken,‚Äù said co-founder Bernardo Cordero. ‚ÄúOne of the biggest problems is that it takes sellers anywhere from six months to two years to sell. So we launched the most radical solution we could find to this problem: an instant offer. This product allows homeowners to sell in days instead of months, a fast and convenient experience they can‚Äôt find anywhere else.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an instant buyer (ibuyer) in Mexico &#8212; and Latin America in general &#8212; is a complex endeavor. Unlike in the U.S., Mexico doesn‚Äôt have a Multiple Listing Service (MLS). As such, pricing data is not readily available. On top of that, agents are not required to be certified, so the whole process of buying and selling a home can be informal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since mortgage penetration in Mexico is also low; it can be difficult for buyers to have access to reasonable financing options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúTo build an iBuyer, we had to solve the transaction end-to-end,‚Äù said co-founder Victor Noguera. ‚ÄúWe had to build the MLS, a third-party marketplace, a contractor marketplace, financial products, broker technology and a home maintenance provider, along with other services. In other words, we have been building the real estate super app for LatAm.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat.mx says its certified remodeled properties have gone through a 200+ point inspection and ‚Äúa full legal review.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flat.mx is growing sales by 70% quarter-over-quarter, and has increased its inventory by 10x over the last year, according to its founders. It has also nearly tripled its headcount from 30 at the middle of last year to over 85 today. So far, Flat.mx has conducted thousands of home valuations and more than 100 transactions.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196956" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196956" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196956 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat.mx_.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat.mx_.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat.mx_.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat.mx_.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat.mx_.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat.mx_.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flat.mx_.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196956" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flat.mx</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic only helped boost interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúOur low-touch digital solution was key for having a strong business during the pandemic. We were able to create quick liquidity for sellers at a time in Mexico where it was complicated to sell,‚Äù said Cordero. ‚ÄúOur model allows sellers to sell with one visit instead of having to receive over 40 potential buyers at a time where they wanted to sell but also wanted to avoid contact with many buyers.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to continue to develop what it describes as a ‚Äúone-stop shop where homeowners and buyers will be able to get all the services they need in one place.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders believe that rather than just try to tackle one aspect of the homebuying process, it makes more sense in emerging markets to address them all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe believe that each one of our products makes the others stronger and creating this ecosystem of products will continue to give us an important advantage in the market,‚Äù said Noguera. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to also use the capital from the round to expand its presence in Mexico for iBuying, and to invest in data and financial products.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Flat.mx&#8217;s investors are bullish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archie Cochrane, principal investor at Anthemis Group, said his firm views Flat.mx as an integral part of its embedded finance thesis in the context of the Mexican property sector.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe iBuyer model itself is well understood and developed in many parts of the world, but it is also a complex model with many variables that requires a seasoned and astute team to execute the strategy,‚Äù Cochrane wrote via email. &#8220;When we met Victor and Bernardo, it was clear that their clarity of vision and deep understanding of the broader opportunity set would allow them to succeed over the long term.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim Chae, managing partner at 500 Startups, said he envisions that Flat.mx will become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äúthe go-to route‚Äù for buyers, sellers, agents and lenders in Mexican real estate.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThere are nuances and specific problems that are unique to Mexico that Flat.mx has done a great job identifying and solving,‚Äù he said.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALLVP partner Fernando Lelo de Larrea said that essentially after years of ‚Äúunkept promises,‚Äù software is finally transforming the real estate industry in Mexico.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúMost models replicate successful models from the more mature U.S. proptech space,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSince we started investing in proptech, we‚Äôve never seen such an innovative approach to seizing a trillion-dollar opportunity.‚Äù</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A stealthy startup co-founded by a former senior designer from Apple and one of its ex-senior software engineers has picked up a significant round of funding to build out its business. <a href="https://hu.ma.ne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humane</a>, which has ambitions to build a new class of consumer devices and technologies that stem from &#8220;a genuine collaboration of design and engineering&#8221; that will represent &#8220;the next shift between humans and computing&#8221;, has raised $100 million.</p>
<p>This is a Series B, and it&#8217;s coming from some very high-profile backers. Tiger Global Management is leading the round, with SoftBank Group, BOND, Forerunner Ventures and Qualcomm Ventures also participating. Other investors in this Series B include Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, Kindred Ventures, Marc Benioff&#8217;s TIME Ventures, Valia Ventures, NEXT VENT≈™RES, Plexo Capital and the legal firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.</p>
<p>Humane has been around since 2017, but it closed/filed its Series A only last year: $30 million in September 2020 at a $150 million valuation, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/327321-91/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>. Previous to that, it had raised just under $12 million, with many of the investors in this current round backing Humane in those earlier fundraises, too.</p>
<p>Valuation with this Series B is not being disclosed, the company confirmed to me.</p>
<p>Given that Humane has not yet released any products, nor has said much at all about what it has up its sleeve, and given that hardware in general presents a lot of unique challenges and therefore is often seen as a risky bet (that old &#8220;hardware is hard&#8221; chestnut), you might be wondering how Humane, still in stealth, has attracted these backers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="emzYVTLw8R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/5-consumer-hardware-vcs-share-their-2021-investment-strategies/">5 consumer hardware VCs share their 2021 investment strategies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 consumer hardware VCs share their 2021 investment strategies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/5-consumer-hardware-vcs-share-their-2021-investment-strategies/embed/#?secret=emzYVTLw8R" data-secret="emzYVTLw8R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Some of that attention possibly stems from the fact that the two co-founders, husband-and-wife team Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, are something of icons in their own right. Bongiorno, who is Humane&#8217;s CEO, had been the software engineering director at Apple. Chaudhri, who is Humane&#8217;s chairman and president, is Apple&#8217;s former director of design, where he worked for 20 years on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/apple-watch-designer-reveals-the-devices-origins-on-its-fifth-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of its most seminal products</a> &#8212; the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac. Both have dozens of patents credited to them from their time there, and they have picked up a few since then, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those latest patents &#8212; plus the very extensive list of job openings listed on Humane&#8217;s otherwise quite sparse site &#8212; might be the closest clues we have for what the pair and their startup might be building.</p>
<p>One patent is for a &#8220;Wearable multimedia device and cloud computing platform with laser projection system&#8221;; another is for a &#8220;System and apparatus for fertility and hormonal cycle awareness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company currently has nearly 50 job openings listed, including engineers with camera and computer vision experience, hardware engineers, designers and security experts, among many others. (One sign of where all that funding will be going.) There is already an impressive team of about 60 people at the company, which is another detail that attracted investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The caliber of individuals working at Humane is incredibly impressive,&#8221; said Chase Coleman, partner, Tiger Global, in a statement. &#8220;These are people who have built and shipped transformative products to billions of people around the world. What they are building is groundbreaking with the potential to become a standard for computing going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked for more details on the company&#8217;s product roadmap and ethos behind the company, and who its customers might potentially be: other firms for whom it designs products, or end users directly?</p>
<p>For now, Bongiorno and Chaudhri seem to hint that part of what has motivated them to start this business was to reimagine what role technology might play in the next wave of innovation. It&#8217;s a question that many ask, but not many try to actually invest in finding the answer. For that alone, it&#8217;s worth watching Humane (if Humane lets us, that is: it&#8217;s still very much in stealth) to see what it does next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humane is a place where people can truly innovate through a genuine collaboration of design and engineering,&#8221; the co-founders said in a joint statement. &#8220;We are an experience company that creates products for the benefit of people, crafting technology that puts people first ‚Äî a more personal technology that goes beyond what we know today. We&#8217;re all waiting for something new, something that goes beyond the information age that we have all been living with. At Humane, we&#8217;re building the devices and the platform for what we call the intelligence age. We are committed to building a different type of company, founded on our values of trust, truth and joy. With the support of our partners, we will continue to scale the team with individuals who not only share our passion for revolutionizing the way we interact with computing, but also for how we build.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: After publishing, I got a little more from Humane about its plans. Its aim is to build &#8220;t<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">echnology that improves the human experience and is born of good intentions; p</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">roducts that put us back in touch with ourselves, each other, and the world around us; and e</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">xperiences that are built on trust, with interactions that feel magical and bring joy.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a whole lot to go on, but more generally it&#8217;s an approach that seems to want to step away from the cycle we&#8217;re on today, and be more mindful and thoughtful. If they can execute on this, while still building rather than wholesale rejecting technology, they might be on to something.</span></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>A few years ago, I moved my startup‚Äôs headquarters to New York from Estonia on an E-2 investor visa. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I‚Äôve taken on a few investors since then, but if I take on more, I run the risk of no longer qualifying for an E-2 because my equity is diluting. </strong><strong>I‚Äôm considering either having my startup sponsor me for an O-1A visa or self-petitioning an EB-1A green card. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Any advice or insights on how to present a strong case for an O-1A or EB-1A? Thanks!</strong></p>
<p><strong>‚Äî Savvy Startup Founder</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dear Savvy,</p>
<p>Congrats on your success so far! Yes, we have many best practices to pass along for filing for an O-1A extraordinary ability visa or an EB-1A extraordinary ability green card.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/nadia-zaidi/">Nadia Zaidi</a>, an associate attorney at Alcorn Immigration Law and an expert in immigration law services for startups and creatives, and I recently did a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/086-back-to-school-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp-part-2/">podcast</a> reviewing what to keep in mind when filing for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/o-visas/">O-1A visa</a>, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A green card</a> or <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)</a> green card. Take a listen! I would also recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney who can help you determine the best approach based on your timing and goals.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you pursue an O-1A visa, you will need to show that your startup and you have an employer-employee relationship, or you will need an agent to file on your behalf. If demonstrating an employer-employee relationship, that usually involves showing that your startup‚Äôs board of directors oversees your work and can fire you.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>You might also want to consider filing for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP). My firm has filed several IEP petitions on behalf of clients. Based on our experience, it takes less time to prepare an IEP petition than an O-1A petition because it‚Äôs not as document-intensive. Moreover, if you‚Äôre married and you‚Äôre granted IEP status, your spouse will be eligible to apply for a work permit. The spouse of an O-1A visa holder is not eligible for a work permit.</p>
<p>Getting back to answering your question, here are some best practices for filing for either an O-1A or an EB-1A:</p>
<h2>Field of expertise</h2>
<p>Spend some time homing in on your area of expertise. Because both the O-1A and EB-1A are for individuals of extraordinary ability or accomplishments who are at the top of their field, the more narrowly defined your field of expertise is, the easier it will be to demonstrate that you are at the top of it. For example, instead of listing tech entrepreneurship as your area of expertise, narrow it to something like entrepreneurship focused on developing machine learning software for the healthcare industry. Work with an experienced immigration attorney to craft your field for the petition.</p>
<h2>Qualification criteria</h2>
<p>Familiarize yourself with the qualification criteria for the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/o-visas/">O-1A</a> and <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A</a>, which are similar, and determine which of your skills and achievements best meet the criteria. As a startup founder, the critical and essential role you play at your startup should be easy to demonstrate. Remember, this is not the time to be humble.</p>
<p>Under your leadership, how much funding has your startup raised? Have you received any significant awards? What is your startup‚Äôs annual recurring revenue, and how many jobs have you created in the U.S.? Were you invited to judge a pitch competition, speak on a panel or mentor others based on your background, experience or skill set? Were you invited to become a member of an exclusive organization that has a rigorous selection process? Are you a thought leader in your field?</p>
<p>You will need to gather recommendation letters ‚Äî more on those in a moment ‚Äî and documentary evidence to demonstrate your achievements, such as a scan or photo of an award, email correspondences, copies or screenshots of articles written either about you or by you, or screenshots of a conference agenda or presentation on YouTube that generated a significant number of views. You should know that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) does not consider awards or prizes given out at the university level to be significant accomplishments. Some investments through competitions can qualify as awards, and some investments might not.</p>
<h2>Recommendation letters</h2>
<p>We typically recommend obtaining five to eight letters from experts in your field who can discuss your abilities and accomplishments and the significance of their impact on your field or beyond. Typically, the more details and examples provided in the recommendation letter ‚Äî discussed in easy-to-understand terms ‚Äî the more compelling the letter. You should keep in mind that the immigration official who is evaluating your case will likely not be an expert in your field.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs often valuable to submit letters from a variety of individuals, such as those who have worked directly with you and those who only know of you based on your work within your field, academic and professional experts, and individuals from both inside and outside the United States.</p>
<p>Make sure to ask prospective recommenders if they‚Äôre willing to submit a letter to USCIS on your behalf. While most recommenders are time-constrained individuals who prefer that you write a draft letter that they can edit, some recommenders prefer to write their own letters, which is good to know from the get-go. Make sure that those individuals who are doing so are willing to edit and make changes to any drafts, such as eliminating jargon or adding more detail.</p>
<p>The process of finalizing recommendation letters and getting them signed along with gathering documentary evidence for a case usually takes longer than most people anticipate. That said, get started!</p>
<p>All the best in the next phase of growing your startup!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is appealing the more than half a billion-dollar fine it got slapped with by France&#8217;s competition authority in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">July</a>.</p>
<p>The penalty relates to the adtech giant&#8217;s approach toward paying news publishers for content reuse.</p>
<p>In a statement today, Sebastien Missoffe, a Google France VP and country manager, characterized the fine as &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; &#8212; claiming that the $592 million penalty is not justified in light of Google&#8217;s &#8220;efforts&#8221; to cut a deal with news publishers and comply with updated copyright rules. Which reads like fairly weak sauce, as defence statements go.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are appealing the French Competition Authority‚Äôs decision which relates to our negotiations between April and August 2020. We disagree with a number of legal elements, and believe that the fine is disproportionate to our efforts to reach an agreement and comply with the new law,&#8221; wrote Missoffe, adding: &#8220;Irrespective of this, we recognize neighboring rights and we continue to work hard to resolve this case and put deals in place. This includes expanding offers to 1,200 publishers, clarifying aspects of our contracts, and we are sharing more data as requested by the French Competition Authority in their July Decision.‚Äù</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google fined $592M in France for breaching antitrust order to negotiate copyright fees for news snippets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/embed/#?secret=uo1ZllDYAb" data-secret="uo1ZllDYAb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">2019</a>, the European Union agreed on an update to digital copyright rules which extended cover to the ledes of news stories &#8212; snippets of which aggregators such as Google News had for years routinely scraped and displayed.</p>
<p>Individual EU Member States then needed to transpose the updated pan-EU reforms into their national laws &#8212; with France leading the pack to do so.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The country&#8217;s competition watchdog has also been leading the charge in enforcing updated rules against Google &#8212; ordering the tech giant to negotiate with publishers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/frances-competition-watchdog-orders-google-to-pay-for-news-reuse/">last year</a> and following that up with a whopping fine when publishers complained to it about how Google was treating those talks.</p>
<p>Announcing the penalty this summer, the <em>Autorit√© de la Concurrence</em> accused the tech giant of attempting to unilaterally impose a global news licensing product it operates upon local publishers in a bid to avoid having to put a separate financial value on neighbouring rights remuneration &#8212; where there is a legal requirement (under EU and French law) upon it to negotiate with said publishers&#8230;</p>
<p>The watchdog&#8217;s full list of grievances against Google&#8217;s <em>modus operandi</em> was very long &#8212; check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">our earlier report here</a> &#8212; so it&#8217;s not clear how much of a placeholder action this appeal by Google is.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-appeals-french-500-mln-eur-copyright-fine-2021-09-01/">Reuters</a>, the <em>Autorit√©¬†</em>has said the appeal will not hold up the penalty nor impede the timeline of the order it already issued &#8212; which, in mid July, gave Google a two month timeframe to revise its offer and provide publishers with all the required info, with the threat of daily fines (of ‚Ç¨900,000) if it failed to meet all its requirements by then. So there are now only a couple of weeks to go before that deadline.</p>
<p>Google may thus be hoping that by announcing an appeal now it will help &#8216;concentrate&#8217; publishers&#8217; minds &#8212; and encourage them to accept &#8212; whatever tweaked offer it comes up with, hence its statement noting an &#8216;expanded&#8217; offer (now covering 1,200 publishers), and talk of &#8220;clarifying aspects of our contracts&#8221; and &#8220;sharing more data&#8221;, all of which were areas where Google got roundly spanked by the <em>Autorit√©.¬†</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disrupt is right around the corner, and this year the show is packed to the brim with incredible panels and conversations, an absolutely <em>stacked</em> Startup Battlefield cohort of companies launching on our stage, investor insights and a virtual expo hall <em>full</em> of exciting new products and services in the Startup Alley.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait! Literally. So we&#8217;re giving you guys a sneak peek at some of the startups you might see at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> in upcoming episodes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, the Extra Crunch Live crew sits down with founders and the investors who finance them to learn how they decided to partner with one another and, ultimately, how startups can get to &#8220;yes&#8221; when fundraising. In the latter half of the episode, those same guests give live feedback to folks in the audience who come on our virtual stage and pitch their products.</p>
<p>Truth be told, everyone loves a good pitch-off. So in these upcoming Startup Alley Edition episodes of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;re turning the entire episode into a pitch-off. SUA companies will come on stage, one at a time, and have exactly 60 seconds to get us excited about their startup. But it wouldn&#8217;t be a true pitch-off without some expert feedback.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the investors joining us on these episodes to share their insights and wisdom with both the startups and the audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is getting into fantasy sports and other types of fantasy games. The company this morning <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/introducing-facebook-fantasy-games/">announced</a> the launch of Facebook Fantasy Games in the U.S. and Canada on the Facebook app for iOS and Android. Some games are described as &#8220;simpler&#8221; versions of the traditional fantasy sports games already on the market, while others allow users to make predictions associated with popular TV series, like &#8220;Survivor&#8221; or &#8220;The Bachelorette.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first game to launch is Pick &amp; Play Sports, in partnership with Whistle Sports, where fans get points for correctly predicting the winner of a big game, the points scored by a top player or other events that unfold during the match. Players can also earn bonus points for building a streak of correct predictions over several days. This game is arriving today.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196907" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196907" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196907 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NRP-Fantasy-Games-on-Facebook_Inline_2.png?w=680" alt="Facebook gaming and fantasy" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NRP-Fantasy-Games-on-Facebook_Inline_2.png 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NRP-Fantasy-Games-on-Facebook_Inline_2.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NRP-Fantasy-Games-on-Facebook_Inline_2.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NRP-Fantasy-Games-on-Facebook_Inline_2.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NRP-Fantasy-Games-on-Facebook_Inline_2.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NRP-Fantasy-Games-on-Facebook_Inline_2.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196907" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>In the months ahead, it will be followed by other games in sports, TV and pop culture, including Fantasy Survivor, where players choose a set of castaways from the popular CBS TV show to join their fantasy team and Fantasy &#8220;The Bachelorette,&#8221; where fans will pick a group of men from the suitors vying for the Bachelorette&#8217;s heart and get points based on their actions and events that take place during the show. Other upcoming sports-focused games include MLB Home Run Picks, where players pick the team that they think will hit the most home runs, and LaLiga Winning Streak, where fans predict the team that will win that day.</p>
<p>In addition to top players being featured on leaderboards, games have a social component for those who want to play with friends.</p>

<p>Players can create their own fantasy league with friends to compete with one another or against other fans, either publicly or privately. League members can compare scores with each other and will have a place where they can share picks, reactions and comments. This league area resembles a private group on Facebook, as it offers its own compose box for posting only to members, and its own dedicated feed. However, the page is designed to support groups with specific buttons to &#8220;play&#8221; or view the &#8220;leaderboard,&#8221; among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The addition of fantasy games could help Facebook increase the time users spent on its app at a time when the company is facing significant competition in social, namely from TikTok. According to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/go/state-of-mobile-2021/">App Annie</a>, the average monthly time spent per user in TikTok grew faster than other top social apps in 2020, including by 70% in the U.S., surpassing Facebook.</p>
