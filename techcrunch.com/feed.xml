										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/">Fairphone</a>, the Dutch social enterprise dedicated to making consumer electronics (more) sustainable and ethical, including by supporting repairability so that users can hold onto their hardware for longer, has announced public testing of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/google-releases-android-10/">Android 10</a> for the six-year-old <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/04/meet-the-tiny-phone-company-thats-making-modularity-sustainable/">Fairphone 2</a>.</p>
<p>Owners of the modular handset that was first released back in 2015, running Android 5, should expect to be able to upgrade to Android 10 (released date: 2019) in early 2022, Fairphone said today, announcing the beta rollout of the upgrade.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Meet the tiny phone company that&#8217;s making modularity sustainable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/04/meet-the-tiny-phone-company-thats-making-modularity-sustainable/embed/#?secret=LMDVwZjYLb" data-secret="LMDVwZjYLb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Fairphone stopped producing (but not supporting) the Fairphone 2 back in 2018 &#8212; going on to release the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/08/fairphone-3-is-a-normal-smartphone-with-ethical-shine/">Fairphone 3</a> (in 2019); the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/grab-your-screwdriver/">Fairphone 3+</a> (in 2020; also available as a modular upgrade to the 3); and, earlier this fall, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/fairphone-4/">Fairphone 4</a>, its first 5G handset &#8212; which it said would be supported until at least 2025.</p>
<p>Given the Fairphone 2&#8217;s impending update to Android 10 next year &#8212; which will mean it will have been supported for a total of seven years &#8212; 2025 looks like a conservative estimate of how long Fairphone 4 owners should expect to receive software support.</p>
<p>Fairphone says it collaborated with its community of users for the Android 10 upgrade project &#8212; and with a software developer in India, <a href="https://teamb58.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teamb58.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637853157006000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vF9VwqrfXQS42iHeRd5qr">Bharath Ravi Prakash</a>, which it says worked as a volunteer open source dev &#8212; and by doing that says it was able to streamline the process and shrink the time required to carry out the upgrade.</p>
<p>So while the prior Fairphone 2 OS update (to Android 9) took 18 months, this time the process has been condensed to 10 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google, meanwhile, has gone on to release Android 11 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/android-11-has-arrived/">2020</a>) and Android 12 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/android-12-launched/">last month</a>) &#8212; for a sense of how far behind the Fairphone 2 upgrades are trailing the latest OS release.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company learned a lot from the Android 9 upgrade and although still complex, Android 10 was more predictable than Android 9,&#8221; Fairphone notes in a press release which also quotes its head of software longevity &amp; IT, Agnes Crepet, who writes: “Our unique approach to software has allowed us to help our users keep their devices for as long as possible. We’re pleased to be able to provide our Fairphone 2 community with yet another software upgrade, reaching our goal to provide at least five years of support from launch for our phones and with the Android 10 upgrade, we’re going beyond that to seven years of support. We are constantly raising the bar for ourselves and the industry, showing that doing things more sustainably in software is possible.”</p>
<p>Seven years&#8217; support puts Fairphone into Apple iPhone software support timespans. But of course the average Android-based handset can expect fair fewer years of software love &#8212; typically Android smartphones only get around three years&#8217; support. So it&#8217;s a major achievement.</p>
<p>And while Fairphone may only now be catching up to Apple on the software longevity front it is already years ahead of Cupertino in another respect: Hardware sustainability through repairability via modular construction and offering direct-to-consumer spare parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/beginning-next-year-apple-will-mail-you-parts-and-tools-to-fix-your-iphone-and-mac-at-home/">Earlier this month</a> Apple announced that, starting next year, it would kick off a &#8216;Self Service Repair&#8217; program &#8212; shipping spare parts and repair tools to iPhone and Mac users to let them perform basic repairs at home.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s by no means full modularity from the company that has &#8212; historically &#8212; loved a hermetically sealed, stupidly thin, often <em>literally</em> glued shut box but it is a small step in a more sustainable direction. And one that Fairphone has long pioneered.</p>

<p>Apple has sent threat notification alerts to victims of state-sponsored hackers in Thailand, El Salvador and Uganda, just hours after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">filing a lawsuit against </a>Israeli spyware maker NSO Group<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">.</a></p>
<p>At least six Thai activists and researchers who have been critical of the government have received the notification, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-warns-thai-activists-state-sponsored-attackers-may-have-targeted-iphones-2021-11-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a>, including Prajak Kongkirati, a political scientist at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, researcher Sarinee Achananuntakul and Thai activist Yingcheep Atchanont of the legal monitoring group iLaw. Citizen Lab, which tracks illegal hacking and surveillance, identified in 2018 a Pegasus spyware operator active within Thailand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239252" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The alerts — which Apple says are <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sa/HT212960" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designed to inform and assist users who may have been targeted</a> by state-sponsored attackers — were also sent to a number of users in El Salvador. This includes 12 employees from <a href="https://elfaro.net/es/202111/el_salvador/25861/Apple-env%C3%ADa-alerta-de-espionaje-patrocinado-por-el-Estado-a-12-miembros-de-El-Faro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">El Faro</a>, an online digital newspaper that has been notoriously critical of the government, as well as two leaders of civil society organizations and two opposition politicians.</p>
<p>Norbert Mao, the president of the Democratic Party in Uganda, also said on <a href="https://twitter.com/norbertmao/status/1463364241688305664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> that he had received the threat notification.</p>
<p>The alert from Apple warns: “Apple believes you are being targeted by state-sponsored attackers who are trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID. These attackers are likely targeting you individually because of who you are or what you do. If your device is compromised by a state-sponsored attacker, they may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone. While it’s possible this is a false alarm, please take this warning seriously.”</p>
<p>Apple on Tuesday sued NSO Group to seek <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">a permanent injunction</a> to prevent the spyware maker from using any Apple product. This would make it more difficult for the company to find and exploit vulnerabilities in iPhone software and hack its targets.</p>
<p>“The steps we’re taking today will send a clear message: In a free society it is unacceptable to weaponize powerful state-sponsored spyware against those who seek to make the world a better place,” said Apple’s security chief Ivan Krstić. “Apple runs one of the most sophisticated security engineering operations in the world, and we will continue to work tirelessly to protect our users from abusive state-sponsored actors like NSO Group.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Buy now, pay later&#8221; company <a href="https://www.afterpay.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afterpay</a> announced Wednesday that it was going after the <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1525238.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 trillion global subscription payments market</a> by offering to its U.S. customers payment installments for subscriptions, like gym memberships, entertainment subscriptions and online services.</p>
<p>The service will launch in both the U.S. and Australia beginning early in 2022 and will be free for customers who pay on time. IPSY, BoxyCharm, Savage X Fenty and Fabletics are among the initial list of merchants that will offer the feature. The company plans to expand the feature in-store and into other regions later, including Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and Europe.</p>
<p>In addition to paying for subscriptions in installments, Afterpay is also enabling its offering to be used on preordered items, where users can pay in four installments over time once the item ships. Another feature coming soon will allow merchants to accept deposits on custom items.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239268" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;By offering customers the option to pay for subscriptions with Afterpay, we&#8217;re not only giving consumers flexibility to pay for more expensive monthly costs, but we&#8217;re also helping our merchant partners capture a wider consumer base through this convenient experience,” said Zahir Khoja, general manager of North America for Afterpay, in a written statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/klarna-offers-pay-now-option-in-u-s-klarna-card-coming-soon/">Klarna</a>, Afterpay’s competitor in the BNPL space, also announced news this week for its U.S. customers that it was offering its “Pay Now” option.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">Square announced that it was buying Afterpay</a> in an all-stock deal valued at $29 billion. Afterpay has also been on a roll with feature debuts recently, launching both Afterpay Ads, a suite of advertising products for brands to engage with shoppers within the ecosystem, and merchant analytics tool Afterpay IQ, in August.</p>
<p>Afterpay works with 100,000 retailers and has approximately <a href="https://corporate.afterpay.com/investors/asx-announcements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10.5 million active customers in North America</a> as of June 30, up from 5.6 million the year prior. North America is the company’s “largest region in terms of underlying sales,” which grew 145% year over year, or from $4 billion in fiscal year 2020 to $9.8 billion in fiscal year 2021, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday episode when we niche down to a single topic, looking to expand our understanding of one particular technology trend or another. And this week, it was all about the ConstitutionDAO.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For those who weren&#8217;t online last week, here&#8217;s what you missed: a not-so-subtle group of strangers on the internet banded together to try to buy one of the remaining 13 copies of the Constitution. With crypto. The bold bid eventually fell short, but many saw it as an inspiring </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">onramp into how communities can mobilize around a shared goal in a web3 world. </a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The whole movement, from its meme start to its poetic, and billionaire Ken Griffin-themed, end, was just too interesting for Equity to not dedicate an entire episode to.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> brought on <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lucas Matney</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaRamaswamy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anita Ramaswamy </a>to unpack, decompress and bond over our shared experience of witnessing this &#8220;financial flash mob.&#8221;</p>
<p>We talked about what a DAO is, and what they might be used for. We dug into the question of just how many folks the effort really brought to the larger &#8220;web3&#8221; space. And, of course, we had to talk about gas fees, NFTs and the pace of innovation in crypto more broadly. Lucas even broke out an excellent analogy to explain level-two chains!</p>
<p>The crew were generally bullish on the blockchain economy, if skeptical of some of its current uses. In short, the potential remains potent in crypto even if some of its projects, today at least, are a bit more boring than breakthrough. Crypto, we&#8217;re told, is going to shake up the world. More of that, we reckon, and less of the meme-wars wouldn&#8217;t be amiss.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[More dollars, rising deal sizes. What's going on in Canada?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s boom times for startups building with or atop AI functionality: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Exchange </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/huge-deals-are-pushing-more-ai-startups-into-ipo-territory/">explored the rise</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in venture capital dollars for AI startups last week, noting that investment into the business niche set all-time records in Q4 2020, and then successively in quarters one, two and three in 2021.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Given how heated the overall venture capital market is proving to be, those data points were only so surprising. What did shock us a little, however, was how active the Canadian AI startup market has been this year.</p>
<p>Perhaps it shouldn’t have. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/matt-cohen/">Matt Cohen</a>, a managing partner at Ripple Ventures, told The Exchange that “while investment in Canadian startups of all varieties has ramped up lately, AI-enabled startups are certainly leading the pack.”</p>
<p>We’re behind, it turns out. But not so far behind that we cannot catch up on the Canadian AI startup story. Our questions are simple: Why are Canadian startups seeing their fundraising fortunes rise so sharply, what parts of the AI stack are being attacked, what role does public money play in the rising investment totals, and what impact do local universities have on artificial intelligence work in Canada?</p>

<p>We’ll start with data, and then talk about what&#8217;s pushing up the numbers.</p>
<h2>From the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4ALQyinHGIctf3q6YhWemg?si=c08f581ec3e74384">land of milk in a bag</a>, rising AI investment</h2>
<p>Let’s start from a yearly perspective. Funding for Canadian AI startups rose to record heights in 2019 before seeing declines in 2020 to just $488 million in total funding. But 2021 is proving to be more than a return to form for Canadian AI startups, with some $1.5 billion raised through the third quarter.</p>
<p>The results are a bit uneven, to be fair. Canada saw $895 million across 21 deals in Q2 2021 AI funding, and just $446 million in the third quarter, albeit from a slightly higher deal count of 24. But as the Q3 2021 dollar result for the country is nearly on par with its full-year 2020 total, it&#8217;s hard to be too bearish.</p>
<p>The evolution of Canadian AI funding as a portion of all venture capital funding in the country is impressive. AI companies raised 16% of known venture capital funds in 2021 thus far, a huge gain on the mere 2% that they were worth of total dollar volume in 2016.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With Tesla&#8217;s latest FSD (&#8220;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Full Self-Driving</a>&#8220;) release, it&#8217;s asking drivers to consent to allowing it to collect video taken by a car&#8217;s exterior and interior cameras in case of an accident or &#8220;serious safety risk.&#8221; That will mark the first time Tesla will attach footage to a specific vehicle and driver, according to an <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/23/tesla-asks-full-self-driving-beta-to-accept-being-recorded-crash-safety-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>Electrek</em></a> report.</p>
<p>Tesla has gathered video footage as part of FSD before, but it was only used to train and improve its AI self-driving systems. According to the new agreement, however, Tesla will now be able to associate video to specific vehicles. &#8220;By enabling FSD Beta, I consent to Tesla’s collection of VIN-associated image data from the vehicle’s external cameras and Cabin Camera in the occurrence of a serious safety risk or a safety event like a collision,&#8221; the agreement reads.</p>
<blockquote><p>By enabling FSD Beta, I consent to Tesla’s collection of VIN-associated image data from the vehicle’s external cameras and Cabin Camera in the occurrence of a serious safety risk or a safety event like a collision.</p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239243" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As <em>Electrek</em> notes, the language could indicate that Tesla wants to ensure it has evidence in case its FSD system is blamed for an accident. It could possibly also be used to detect and fix serious issues more quickly.</p>
<p>FSD 10.3 was released more widely than previous betas, but it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-pulls-latest-self-driving-beta-over-left-turn-and-other-issues-063331006.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">quickly pulled back</a> due to issues like unwarranted Forward Collision Warnings, unexpected autobraking and more. At the time, CEO Elon Musk tweeted that such issues are &#8220;to be expected with beta software,&#8221; adding that &#8220;it is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, other drivers on public roads are unwitting beta testers, too. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-investigation-192733573.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">currently investigating</a> a driver&#8217;s complaint that FSD led to a November 3rd collision in Brea, California. The owner alleged that it caused his Model Y to enter the wrong lane and hit another car, causing considerable damage to both.</p>
<p>Tesla is releasing the new beta to even more users with Driver Safety Scores of 98 and up — previously, beta releases were limited to drivers with perfect 100 scores. Tesla charges drivers $199 per month for the feature or $10,000 in one shot, but has failed meet promised deadlines for autonomous driving. Currently, the FSD system is considered to be a Level 2 system — far from the Level 4 required to really be &#8220;full self-driving.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Standardizing the charging of e-scooters would be beneficial for end consumers and micromobility companies alike. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="article__contributor-byline-wrapper">

	<div class="contributor-byline__contributor">
		<div class="byline__author">
							<span class="byline__author-name">Roman Bysko</span>
						<span class="byline__author-title" style="display: block;">Contributor</span>
		</div>

			</div>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/byskoro/">Roman Bysko</a> is a co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.meredot.com/">Meredot</a>, a mobility infrastructure company that develops next-gen electric charging stations. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Compared with cars, e-scooters are a lower-carbon, quieter and cheaper means of transport that can make a positive impact on urban mobility and the environment. However, despite their promising potential, the majority of the urban population perceives them either as toys or a <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/Injuries-Using-E-Scooters-E-Bikes-and-Hoverboards-Jump-70-During-the-Past-Four-Years">public safety hazard</a>.</p>
<p>The amount of venture investments in the industry is correspondingly meager: Since 2010, shared micromobility <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">received</a> only $9 billion in investments <em>globally</em> &#8212; compare that with the $72.3 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">raised</a> by U.S. startups in the third quarter of this year alone. If we want to move toward a truly sustainable urban environment where people en masse choose low-carbon micromobility transport over cars, we need to find ways to make this business profitable.</p>
<p>Initially, e-scooter operators were competing for the attention of riders by putting as many e-scooters as they could on the market, and physical presence meant success. As cities started to adopt regulations and grant licenses, the operators’ focus shifted to getting approvals from city officials because licenses secured their access to end consumers and gave confidence that allowed for long-term planning.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238144" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The licenses also eased the task for investors, and the startups that secured licenses saw a surge of funding. For instance, in 2021, players like Tier, Voi and Dott <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/europe-leads-the-pack-for-2021s-micromobility-vc-deals">raised</a> a cumulative $490 million.</p>
<p>This sends a clear message to other e-scooter operators that aim to compete on the market: If you want to raise investments and grow, claim a place in the cities first. Currently, this applies predominantly to Europe, which has a better infrastructure and serves as a test site for micromobility transport and business models.</p>
<p>However, when micromobility at large proves efficient for urban communities, these practices will likely expand to other regions such as the U.S., where major cities are already <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/is-the-us-becoming-more-bike-friendly">building</a> more bike lanes. Considering that by 2030 global micromobility is <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-micromobility-ridership-and-revenue-after-a-crisis">expected</a> to become a $300 billion to $500 billion industry, it’s well worth the effort.</p>
<p>Merely winning a tender, though, isn’t enough because the licensed operators move on to the next round of competition. They have to meet the expectations of both <a href="https://www.trucks.vc/blog/the-three-axes-of-micromobility-supply-chains-distribution-and-maintenance">end consumers</a> and investors &#8212; that is, to achieve profitability while offering supreme product and product experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, the e-scooter sharing business has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/micromobilitys-next-big-business-is-software-not-vehicles/">not proven profitable</a>, and the existing business models have lots of room for improvement. The most evident issues are expensive charging and operations that may <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/promise-pitfalls-e-scooter-sharing">account</a> for 60% of costs, so even a slight optimization here would be beneficial.</p>
<h2>So what can we do?</h2>
<p>Operations may vary between companies, but charging scenarios are few. Micromobility operators either collect vehicles manually at the end of the day to bring them to charging warehouses or manually swap dead batteries for new ones. Both of these involve manual labor, and some players have started offering solutions that aim to cut this cost.</p>
<p>Taiwan-based e-scooter manufacturer Gogoro <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/gogoro-plans-to-launch-80-battery-swapping-stations-in-china-by-the-end-of-this-year-171414.html">launched</a> swapping stations that essentially pass charging tasks on to riders. So far it’s compatible only with two e-scooter brands. German operator Tier chose a similar approach and recently <a href="https://about.tier.app/tier-raises-200-million-series-d/">rolled out</a> Tier Energy Network: Now, Tier riders can swap batteries themselves using PowerBoxes installed at local partner shops. However, if an operator goes for swapping, they have to have at least two batteries in stock for every e-scooter in their fleet, and battery cells are <a href="https://www.trucks.vc/blog/the-three-axes-of-micromobility-supply-chains-distribution-and-maintenance">the most expensive</a> hardware component.</p>
<p>Besides, having to change a route to swap batteries at brand-specific locations might worsen product experience for some consumers and limit an operator’s user base, which is essential when the competition is tight.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the demand for micromobility increases, the stations will need to be able to fit a large number of vehicles simultaneously. It will create a demand for universal infrastructure. Companies such as <a href="https://www.kuhmute.com/">Kuhmute</a> and <a href="https://www.pbsc.com/">PBSC Urban Solutions</a> have partially addressed this issue and developed universal chargers compatible with various e-mobility vehicle types and brands, though many such solutions are electric contact-based and therefore can accommodate only a limited number of vehicles at a time. Besides, stations are prone to contact oxidation in two to three months and change the city landscape.</p>
<p>In that case, a natural next step would be to roll out a one-type-fits-all charger with a substantially bigger parking capacity. Though once we start discussing parking spaces, cities come into play as key stakeholders. They already have to convert plenty of land suitable for residential development into spaces for cars to park, and they’ll need to also assign it to e-scooter charging &#8212; both swapping stations and charging docks have overground hardware.</p>
<p>Some players have started addressing this issue, and such products already exist in the electric car domain. For instance, U.S.-based company <a href="https://witricity.com/">WiTricity</a> has developed a ground charging pad that charges cars wirelessly and over-the-air once vehicles are parked over it. The charger doesn’t have any overground hardware, so it can double as a regular road or sidewalk. The absence of destroyable parts also serves as vandalism protection.</p>
<p>If applied in the e-scooter segment, this technology can improve unit economics by saving on extra batteries and manual labor required to swap or plug them in. Such standardization would be beneficial for end consumers and micromobility companies alike.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In September, the company noted it would be rolling out updates to the way it displays tweets so that they wouldn’t disappear mid-read. These updates have now rolled out to Twitter&#8217;s web and iOS platforms. Twitter notes that it&#8217;s working on making changes to the disappearing tweet experience <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463283116735410176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Android</a> too, but it&#8217;s unknown when the updates will roll out.</p>
<p>Twitter also recently announced that it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/twitter-no-longer-crops-image-previews-on-the-web/">no longer automatically</a> crop image previews on the web, after rolling out full-size image previews on mobile earlier this year. On Twitter for the web, images will now display in full without any cropping. Instead of gambling on how an image will show up in the timeline, images will look just like they did when you shot them. The social media giant first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">tested the change</a> in March with a small subset of iOS and Android users.</p>
<p>These tweaks come as Twitter has been working to enhance its platform and make its services more accessible. The social media giant<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/twitter-now-lets-you-tune-into-spaces-without-an-account-via-direct-links/"> recently rolled out</a> the ability for users to share direct links to their Spaces to let others tune into a live audio session via the web without being logged into the platform. The company also recently introduced its in-app tipping feature to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/twitter-tipping-feature-android-users/">all Android users</a> above the age of 18.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Longevica's goal is to validate the pipeline of turning scientific research into consumer-ready products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Life science company <a href="http://longevica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Longevica</a> said Wednesday it is launching an open research tool so scientists and research institutions can access a data set that tracks the effects of more than 1,000 pharmacological compounds for testing drugs.</p>
<p>This is the latest effort from the biotechnology company, which is researching mechanisms of healthy aging and life extension. To do this, the company took in $2.5 million in funding led by Xploration Capital.</p>
<p>In April, Longevica announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/longevity-startup-longevica-plans-to-launch-supplements-based-on-long-term-research/">launch of a line of supplements</a> based on its research. The company got its start more than 11 years ago and has now raised over $15.5 million in funding from investors, including Alexander Chikunov, a longevity investor, who is also president of the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When the company emerged from stealth, it was primarily focused on finding the best ways to leverage the results of its research as soon as possible and bringing some consumer-ready products to market, Longevica co-founder and CEO Ainar Abdrakhmanov told TechCrunch via email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We still move along this path, which includes screening and trials; however, through a series of deep interviews, we found that most scientists in the longevity space lack infrastructure, and we decided to share our internal engine to leverage more research through partnerships and by giving researchers a data platform for their work,” he added.</p>
<p>Living longer is an area that other companies are working in as well, for both humans and pets. The <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-anti-aging-drugs-market-survey-2021-analysis-with-top-countries-data-growth-sizecurrent-situation-value-research-method-trend-application-and-forecast-by-2027-with-covid-19-impact-analysis-2021-09-20#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20global%20Anti,Drugs%20Scope%20and%20Market%20Size." target="_blank" rel="noopener">global anti-aging drugs market</a> was valued at nearly $8 billion in 2020 and is projected to double by 2027.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crunchbase News took a look at the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/top-venture-investments-for-radical-life-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status of longevity startups</a> in July and found over 30 operating in the space that collectively raised billions of dollars. A more recent example is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/loyal-raises-27m-aims-to-give-dog-owners-more-time-with-their-pets/">Loyal, which raised $27 million</a> to examine longer lives in animals with a long-term vision of translating that into human longevity.</p>

<p>Longevica itself started fundraising when it came up with the idea of the end-to-end open research platform. The new funding will go toward supporting the platform’s development and integration of the company’s research data set.</p>
<p>The goal is to validate the pipeline of turning scientific research into consumer-ready products, Abdrakhmanov said.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of hypotheses around ageing and lifespan, but there’s a clear bottleneck in actually testing those ideas to figure out who might be right,” he added. “Our platform should help the scientific community get a bit closer to the answers.”</p>
<p>Its original study, led by Chikunov and Longevica co-founder Dr. Alexey Ryazanov, tested 1,033 compounds and showed significant life extension properties. The company is close to publishing a peer-reviewed paper on that study. Abdrakhmanov called it “more of a moonshot project,” but also that this direction could bring results much sooner and be beneficial for the entire industry, something its investors were able to see, he added.</p>
<p>Armed with the new research capabilities, Longevica will now go deeper into testing 300 of those compounds with a new research study at Jackson Laboratory. In January, the company will also begin collecting applications from researchers interested in testing their drugs in a full-scale pharmacological screening experiment that will begin in June 2022.</p>
<p>“Also in January, we will start a public database including marked up data on most longevity-related experiments on mice, both public and some which haven’t been published yet,” Abdrakhmanov said. “The entire platform will be free and open source, even its program code will be publicly available on GitHub.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Adil estimates that today’s growth factor costs $2 million per gram to make, but she believes that with efforts from Tiamat Sciences and others, that cost could come down 10 times.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cellular growth medium is a component of cellular agriculture that enables lab-grown meat to be made at a lower cost. However, the traditional ways of making these growth factors, or reagents, are costly themselves, which makes large-scale manufacturing difficult.</p>
<p>On average, reports show that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47724267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lab-grown meat costs about $50</a>, but that new technologies could bring that down to a more reasonable <a href="https://gfi.org/blog/cultivated-meat-lca-tea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 per pound by 2030</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tiamat-sciences.com/">Tiamat Sciences</a> is one biotech startup developing a more cost-effective biomolecule aimed at replacing more costly bioreactors. Today, it announced $3 million in seed financing, led by True Ventures, with participation from Social Impact Capital and Cantos.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238762" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2238769" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238769" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2238769" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png" alt="France-Emmanuelle Adil, Tiamet Sciences" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238769" class="wp-caption-text">France-Emmanuelle Adil, founder and CEO, Tiamet Sciences. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tiamet Sciences</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s CEO, France-Emmanuelle Adil, founded the company in 2019 to manufacture animal-free proteins using a proprietary plant molecular farming approach that combines biotechnology, vertical farming and computation design to reinvent recombinant proteins.</p>
<p>“The growth factors used in media are expensive right now,” she told TechCrunch. “We can reduce costs drastically and reach price parity with meat.”</p>
<p>Adil estimates that today’s growth factor costs $2 million per gram to make, but she believes that with efforts from Tiamat Sciences <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/future-fields-is-tackling-cultured-meats-biggest-problem/">and others</a>, that cost could come down 10 times with a focus on making it 1,000 times cheaper by 2025 so that large-scale production can proceed.</p>
<p>Prior to the $3 million seed round, the company brought in a small round last July to give it $3.4 million in total funding to date. Adil wanted to expand the company, which was in Belgium, where it has an operating site, and moved to North Carolina in May.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will aid in building a pilot production facility in Durham, North Carolina and in technology development. The company is already on its way to reaching carbon-neutral production.</p>
<p>She was not able to disclose customers yet, but said the company is in development of its first product aimed for release by the end of the year. Tiamet would then be sending samples to customers for testing, which she believes will lead to some partnerships in 2022.</p>
<p>In addition to food, Adil says Tiamat’s approach could be applicable in other industries like regenerative medicine and vaccine production.</p>
<p>“Growth factors are transferable to other industries because the processes are similar,” she added. “We will be working on expansion for the end of 2022. We will scale very fast with a number of plants and then 100,000 plants. We are in discussion with companies to help us scale big but progressively.”</p>
<p>Phil Black, co-founder of True Ventures, said the investment into Tiamat Sciences fit into its plant-based portfolio. The initial money raised by the company allows them to prove to people that their technology works and to produce it at the trial level. Then will come a much larger round to scale up from liters to gallons.</p>
<p>“The cell meat industry is here to stay and now people are interested in making it more profitable for themselves and making more of it,” he added. “Limited factors exist, and Taimat’s solution will be a game-changer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spinny, a Gurgaon-based startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/indias-spinny-raises-43-7m-to-expand-its-online-platform-for-selling-used-cars/">operates a platform to facilitate the purchase and sale of used cars</a>, is the latest firm to become a unicorn in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spinny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinny</a> has raised more than $280 million in its Series E financing round, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The round, which is co-led by Tiger Global and Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, values Spinny at over $1.75 billion post-money, the source said.</p>
<p>This is the third funding round raised by Spinny this year. The startup was valued at about $700 million in July this year and $350 million in April.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239214" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new round follows quarters of strong growth that saw Spinny expand to 15 Indian cities, up from fewer than half a dozen last year. The startup has grown its business by four times in the current calendar year, the source said, requesting anonymity as the figures are not public.</p>
<p>Spinny, which counts Elevation Capital and Accel among its existing backers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Indian news outlet Entrackr <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/11/exclusive-spinny-turns-unicorn-after-series-e-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> about the funding round.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of used cars are sold in India each month. But buying them through the offline and traditional channel could prove to be a painstakingly long and high-risk process.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges people face in buying a used car is the trust factor, Niraj Singh, co-founder and chief executive of Spinny told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spinny is addressing this by removing the traditional middlemen from the equation, thereby making it more affordable and reliable for customers to buy a used car. The startup buys cars from the owners, performs thorough and transparent inspection and then makes it available for customers to purchase.</p>

(<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spinny)</p></div></p>
<p>If a customer is not satisfied with the car that they have purchased from Spinny, they get a full refund, the startup says on the website.</p>
<p>The growth potential for Spinny and some other startups operating in this space is massive. The market for auto e-commerce currently has less than 1% penetration in India, according to analysts at Bernstein.</p>
<p>“This is largely because the auto market still requires physical inspections and the target market skews towards used vehicles — an unorganized market,&#8221; they wrote in a report earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The total addressable market in India is around $220 billion, which includes used vehicle purchase by consumers, auctions and remarketing, growth potential for the new vehicles market, and financing and advertisements. The total addressable market for only the used car market in US is over $800 billion,” they wrote in a report earlier this year.</p>
<p>Spinny is the second Indian startup to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/nobroker-becomes-first-indian-proptech-unicorn-with-fresh-210-million-funding/">become a unicorn this week</a>. India has produced over three dozen unicorns this year — more than all other years put together — after several high-profile global investors, including Tiger Global, SoftBank and Falcon Edge Capital, began to double down on the world’s second-largest internet market earlier this year at the height of the ravaging pandemic.</p>
<p>In a letter to shareholders earlier this year, Tiger Global identified India as one of the few markets where it was planning to deploy billions of dollars. SoftBank Group chief executive Rajeev Misra said earlier this month that the Japanese firm has invested more than $3 billion in India this year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/softbank-has-deployed-3-billion-in-india-this-year-can-invest-up-to-10-billion-in-2022/">can invest up to $10 billion in the country</a> next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Convincing meat eaters to adopt a climate-friendly diet might get a little easier thanks to Slovenian startup <a href="https://www.juicymarbles.com/">Juicy Marbles</a>, which has come up with a way to create plant-based whole meat cuts, if that doesn&#8217;t sound too oxymoronic.</p>
<p>&#8216;Fancy Plant Meat&#8217; is its pithier pitch for a product that aims to provide a vegan alternative to eating a filet mignon steak or other &#8216;prime&#8217; cuts of (animal) flesh.</p>
<p>The Ljubljana-based startup is announcing a $4.5 million in seed raise to get its first hunk of prime plant protein to market &#8212; starting with the aforementioned (vegan) filet mignon, which is slated for a Q1 2022 launch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Why filet mignon? It says this type of cut best shows off its proprietary &#8220;marbling technology&#8221;. It&#8217;s also picked filet mignon because the cut is considered the &#8220;crown jewel&#8221; of (meat) steaks.</p>
<p>Plus, there is relatively little competition at the premium end of the fake meat market vs scores of players churning out less fancy/more chopped up alternative protein products such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/beyond-meat-shares-rise-on-news-that-it-collaborated-with-mcdonalds-on-the-mcplant-options/">burgers</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/impossible-adds-ground-pork-and-sausages-to-its-lineup-of-plant-based-foods/">sausages</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/higher-steaks-brings-home-the-bacon-revealing-lab-grown-pork-belly-and-bacon-strips/">bacon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/beyond-meats-plant-based-chicken-tenders-are-coming-to-grocery-stores/">chicken tenders</a> etc. So going big and chunky is one way to stand out in the sizzling alternative protein space.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve decided to begin with the filet mignon because it is the ‘crown jewel’ of the steak world, and it showcases our marbling technology best &#8212; which we would say is our clear and defining selling proposition, before we move onto other whole-cuts,&#8221; Juicy Marbles tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be known for our sirloins, rumps, filets, tomahawks, wagyus, as well as for our filet mignons &#8212; not just the most expensive cuts long-term. Long-term, our view is that we want to make filet mignon more affordable and accessible, given the different economics of it being plant-based.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What are you actually chowing down on when/if you bite into a Juicy Marbles filet mignon? The primary protein is soy &#8212; which the startup argues is both nutritious and environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wider issues with soy farming causing deforestation are solely related to our need to feed animal livestock &#8212; 97% of soy production goes to animal feed, and if all of our meat was plant-based all the negative effects of soy farming would simply disappear,&#8221; it suggests, adding: &#8220;As a crop to feed humans, much less dense land-usage would be required for soya for purely human consumption &#8211; likely less than a third of the farming land currently required.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soya is also versatile, with Juicy Marbles noting that it can be eaten in all sorts of ways &#8212; from fresh to dried, plain, sprouting, ground, fermented, as curd, as a sauce, in soup, as a dessert or a drink etc &#8212; and, thus, by being a &#8220;soya-centric food company&#8221; it will therefore have greater flexibility in what it can cook up.</p>
<p>Concepts in the works include a soy-based tuna steak, for example. (Albeit, it would not be first to market with an animal-free tuna substitute; see, for e.g., YC-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/y-combinators-kuleana-wants-to-make-an-animal-free-substitute-for-raw-tuna/">Kuleana</a>.)</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">&#8220;Our business is based around the concept of protein texture &#8212; this is the defining factor that draws people to steak, when compared to a cheaper cut. In the plant-based meat vertical, there has not been as much innovation in the whole cuts space, and no one has come close to inventing a steak that resembles anything high-end,&#8221; it also tells us. &#8220;Given the need to decarbonise/offer a plant-based alternative in this space as well, we believe this is an immense opportunity untapped by our bigger rivals.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239207" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239207" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2239207" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?w=680" alt="A Juicy Marbles plant-based filet mignon cut being prepared for cooking" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/juicy_marbles_seasoning.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239207" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Juicy Marbles</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;If you look at the plant-based products out there, the offers are currently limited to cheaper cuts &#8212; for example, the burger, or sausages, or bacon &#8212; there are also chunks, i.e. chicken tenders or tins of tuna, but there are no whole-cuts,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Juicy Marbles is keeping the lid on exactly how it&#8217;s able to produce such large slaps of fake meat (claiming &#8220;numerous big food corporations snooping around&#8221; trying to figure out its protein marbling tech).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although it says it will be more transparent in time &#8212; once it&#8217;s able to ensure its IP is protected.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It does specify that its plant steaks are not grown in a lab or 3D printed, saying it&#8217;s using its own patent-pending 3D assembly technology &#8212; which it claims enables it to create &#8220;premium, A5 grade cuts of meat, with full control over the shape, texture, marbling, flavours, aromas and nutrition&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course the proof of all those claims will be in the eating. But Juicy Marbles suggests meat eaters should prepare to be wowed &#8212; both by the &#8220;high-level marbling effect&#8221; and &#8220;bold, rich flavour&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And also by a price-tag that, at launch, will achieve &#8220;parity&#8221; with an &#8220;average-priced&#8221; filet mignon &#8212; and which it says will shrink so that the cost per steak will ultimately (&#8220;within 2-3 years&#8221;) be akin to paying for a more conventional cut of meat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the added benefits front, Juicy Marbles points out that plant-based steaks use non-saturated fats and are low in sodium vs meat equivalents &#8212; so there may be health reasons to consider switching to plant-based steaks (y&#8217;know, if the future of life on Earth isn&#8217;t a big enough reason).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its seed round is led by tree-planting search engine <a href="https://www.worldfund.vc/">Ecosia</a>&#8216;s new <a href="https://www.worldfund.vc/">World Fund</a>&#8212; a €350 million fund targeting startups building tech that can help decarbonize the planet whose launch we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/world-fund-is-a-new-e350m-climate-vc-fund-incubated-by-green-search-engine-ecosia/">last month</a>. (Juicy Marbles is World Fund&#8217;s first investment.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting in a statement, Danijel Visevic, general partner at the fund, said: “There has been a seismic shift in recent years towards plant-based alternatives, driven by a generation who want to make a real difference to the planet and their health. However, so often they’re met with poor substitutes, or they resist going fully plant-based because they’re not ready to give up on little luxuries, like whole cut meats. The team at Juicy Marbles acutely understands this. Their realistic and considered approach, combined with their technology &#8212; and appetites! &#8212; has seen them finally crack a major piece of the plant-based puzzle. We’re excited to join them and witness just how much of an impact they’re due to make in the months and years to come.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other investors in the round are Agfunder, along with a number of angel investors from Y Combinator and Fitbit.</p>
<p>Juicy Marbles says the seed funding will be used to scale production so it can launch its first plant-based steaks into the retail market.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s planning to sell to supermarkets, not just artisanal grocers and restaurants. But says direct to consumer sales will be limited to special offers only owing to the complexity of producing &#8220;planet-responsible&#8221; packaging for shipping perishable goods to individual consumers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also planning to expand its team and further beef up R&amp;D efforts, including on developing new cuts.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">&#8220;All of it is a learning cycle, so with the next round we can set up a gigafactory of plant meat to scale operations and further reduce the price of plant-based meat,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">And in case you&#8217;re curious, the founding team &#8212; Luka Sinček, Maj Hrovat, Tilen Travnik and Vladimir Mićković &#8212; consists of both vegans and meat eaters.</p>

<p>GMC&#8217;s four-ton electric truck has 1,000 horsepower and 11,500 ft/lb of torque generated by its three motors, giving it the capability to get from zero to 60 miles-per-hour within 3 seconds. The truck can also tow up 7,500 pounds and can carry up to 1,300 pounds. It was built on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Ultium battery pack</a>, the platform GM developed to electrify dozens of models across its brands in the coming years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Several French ministers have issued <a href="https://minefi.hosting.augure.com/Augure_Minefi/r/ContenuEnLigne/Download?id=B8B80B7F-2ABD-499B-A002-02E52583C099&amp;filename=1705%20-%20CP%20-%20mesures%20exceptionnelles%20%C3%A0%20lencontre%20de%20la%20place%20de%20march%C3%A9%20Wish.pdf">a common statement</a> announcing that they have asked the main search engines and mobile app stores operating in France to hide Wish’s website and mobile app altogether. Wish is a popular e-commerce platform that mostly references products from China-based merchants. It doesn&#8217;t hold inventory as products are shipped directly from merchants to customers.</p>
<p>Last year, the French administration in charge of consumer rights and fraud <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/french-administration-suspects-wish-of-selling-counterfeit-products/">started investigating</a> Wish. At the time, the <em>direction générale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la répression des fraudes</em> (DGCCRF) suspected that it was a bit too easy to mislead consumers and sell counterfeit goods on Wish, such as sneakers and perfumes with images incorrectly showing the logos of famous brands.</p>
<p>The French administration then ordered 140 different goods on Wish — most of them were imported products. This time, they wanted to find out whether those products were safe or not.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239190" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>95% of toys that they acquired on the platform didn’t comply with European regulation — 45% of them were deemed dangerous. When it comes to electronics goods, 95% of them also shouldn’t be available in Europe, and 90% of them were dangerous in one way or another.</p>
<p>And even cheap costume jewelry sold on the platform presented a risk — 62% of those that they ordered are considered as dangerous. Again, these metrics are based on a very small sample of 140 products.</p>
<p>When Wish is notified that it is selling a dangerous good, those products are removed from the marketplace within 24 hours as expected. And yet, “in most cases, those products remain available under a different name, and sometimes even from the same seller. The company doesn’t keep any log related to transactions of non-compliant and dangerous products,” France’s Ministry of the Economy says in its statement.</p>
<p>According to the same investigation, when Wish notifies customers that they have purchased a dangerous product, it doesn’t mention the reason of the product recall.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In July 2021, the French administration in charge of consumer rights and fraud notified Wish and asked them to comply with European regulation on e-commerce and product safety. The administration gave them a two-month notice before further action.</p>
<p>Four months later, the French government is taking advantage of recent changes in European regulation to dereference or block problematic websites and apps. It’s a convoluted process, but the Ministry of the Economy asked the French administration in charge to ask search engines and app stores to dereference Wish. It&#8217;s going to take a bit of time — at the time of writing, Wish is still available in the App Store and you can still find Wish&#8217;s website in Google search results.</p>
<p>After that, Wish will be shadowbanned in France. The website will still be available and the app will still work if you already have it on your phone. But you won’t see it in search results in the App Store, the Play Store or Google.</p>
<p>If the French administration thinks Wish has implemented proper changes to comply with French regulation, it could lift the shadowban. With this radical decision, France is setting a precedent and shows once again that the web is becoming more and more fragmented. In that case, it says it is acting in the consumers&#8217; best interests.</p>
<p>It’s also going to be interesting to see whether Europe’s upcoming Digital Services Act will have a bigger impact on drop shipping as a whole. Europe is expected to overhaul the e-commerce directive from 2000 with the Digital Services Act.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> A Wish spokesperson has sent me the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At Wish we are dedicated to providing a positive user experience and a large part of that involves making quality products available to our users.</p>
<p>While, as a marketplace platform, we are under no legal obligation to carry out checks on the 150 million products offered for sale on the platform, we invest in a wide range of programs designed to attract and reward sellers that offer quality items, and limit the exposure of those offering lower quality items.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wish has a number of proactive and reactive mechanisms designed to prevent, detect and remove listings that violate any local laws or safety standards. They include a robust internal mechanism for notice and take-down procedure, as well as a repeat merchant offender protocol.</li>
<li>Our recently launched Wish Standards program measures our merchants against a defined set of criteria spanning product quality and refund rates, and rewards them with commission discounts and greater exposure within the app.</li>
<li>As a voluntary signatory of the EC Product Safety Pledge, we react within two working days to government notices to remove listings that offer unsafe products for sale in the EU, which goes above and beyond legal requirements.</li>
<li>Wish is actively diversifying its merchant base by recruiting sellers in a variety of geographies, including Europe, in order to expand product selection and further improve product quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wish always complies with DGCCRF removal requests and is, therefore, puzzled by the excessive approach in regards to this matter. We have repeatedly tried to constructively engage with the DGCCRF. We are now actively pursuing legal recourse to challenge what we see as unlawful and disproportionate action carried out by the DGCCRF.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://attio.com">Attio</a>, a new CRM for people who are familiar with modern collaboration tools, such as <a href="https://www.airtable.com">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>. The startup wants to create a product that can hold all important information about your customers, suppliers and partners, but that is also flexible so that you can organize, view and manipulate data easily.</p>
<p>Attio raised a $7.7 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.pointnine.com">Point Nine</a> with participation from <a href="https://www.balderton.com">Balderton Capital</a> and <a href="https://headline.com">Headline</a>. <a href="https://www.passioncapital.com">Passion Capital</a>, who was already an investor in the company, as well as several angel investors, also participated in the round. Business angels include Front co-founder and CEO Mathilde Collin, Loom co-founder and CTO Vinay Hiremath, Loom and Hyper co-founder Sahed Khan and Indeed co-founder Paul Forster.</p>
<p>That’s a long list of investors and it shouldn’t come as a surprise when you look at the background of the founder. Attio’s co-founder and CEO Nicolas Sharp previous worked for Passion Capital as an associate and then created Attio with Alexander Christie. He spent a lot of time working on the firm’s deal flow process.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238863" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We think that there’s something incredible happening in business software in general and also in CRM in particular,” Sharp told me. He mentioned Airtable and Notion as inspiration. “It allows customers to build whatever they want.”</p>
<p>“We have that thing happening on one hand, which is interesting by itself. On the CRM market, we have this paradigm shift of this new way of selling things. It’s now all about fostering relationships through different channels,” he added.</p>
<p>In other words, CRM software is no longer restricted to sales teams. Now, many people working for company A interact with different people at company B. It becomes hard to keep track of what’s going on when you don’t have a single point of contact.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238866" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238866" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2238866" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Table.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238866" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Attio</p></div></p>
<p>Attio pulls data from your existing tools. When you set up your account, you import your team’s contacts. You can also sync email conversations with the CRM platform. You can choose between two sharing levels — metadata only, or subject lines and metadata. And, of course, you can also sync your calendar.</p>
<p>After that, Attio automatically enriches your data with more information from third-party sources, such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. You can view a timeline of your company’s recent interactions with a specific contact. You can also search for a company and view everybody you know at that company.</p>
<p>It gets particularly interesting when you start building collections. A collection is a list of contacts for a specific project. For instance, you can create a collection with all your investors, another collection with your sales funnel, another collection with reporters you know, etc.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to view a collection. Like in Airtable, you can choose to add data using a spreadsheet-like interface with rows and columns. You can add columns with new attributes that are relevant to your collection.</p>
<p>But you can also switch to kanban view and move contacts from one column to another. There’s also a calendar view. Each view is customizable with filters and a sorting criteria.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238865" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238865" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2238865" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png 4320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Attio-Kanban.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238865" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Attio</p></div></p>
<p>Attio has been designed like most software-as-a-service tools, which means that it works well as a team. You can view recent activity in the activity tab, you can create tasks and add notes to start working on a project as a team.</p>
<p>The company has around 120 paid customers, such as teams working for Coca-Cola, Supercell, Saltpay, Causal and Upfront Ventures. What’s interesting is that Attio isn’t the only ‘new CRM’ trying to reinvent this software category. Other companies include <a href="https://www.folk.app">Folk</a>, which I’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/folk-helps-you-share-contacts-with-your-team/">recently profiled</a>, <a href="https://4degrees.ai">4Degrees</a> and <a href="https://www.affinity.co">Affinity</a>.</p>
<p>When Sharp started thinking about the product, the competitive landscape was different. “At the time, Notion was just getting started. We saw people building new spreadsheets, new note-taking apps. And no one was applying those principles to CRM and that category,” he said. It’s going to be interesting to follow this space to see how it evolves. As for customers, they now have a ton of options when selecting their CRM platform.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are generally three main fintech API infrastructure plays. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is data and financial accounts aggregation (Plaid, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/nigerian-fintech-okra-raises-3-5m-backed-by-accenture-ventures-and-susa-ventures/">Okra</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/tiger-global-backs-african-fintech-mono-in-15m-series-a-round/">Mono</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/stitch-gets-a-2m-seed-extension-hires-benjamin-dada-to-lead-nigerian-expansion/">Stitch</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/african-fintech-pngme-raises-15m-for-its-financial-data-infrastructure-platform/">Pngme</a> are some players in the space)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second focuses on embedded finance and banking as a service, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/treasury-prime-series-b/">Treasury Prime</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/fintech-marqeta-expands-into-credit-card-space/">Marqeta</a> ply their trade. The third is core open banking pioneered by the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/truelayer-nabs-130m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-open-banking-rises-as-a-viable-option-to-card-networks/">TrueLayer</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnePipe’s original game plan was to create an API gateway that connected banks and fintechs under a uniform standard, a move that would allow the company to perform core open banking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But founder and C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/opeadeoye">Ope Adeoye</a> (self-described as the company’s chief plumber), on a call with TechCrunch, said upon continuous integration with these financial institutions, it became clear the company needed to pivot since it wasn’t generating many demand cycles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And having struck partnerships with a few banks, OnePipe decided to take a step back and delve into the world of embedded finance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike open banking and data aggregation plays where a company needs to collaborate with almost every bank in the country where they operate, it’s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the case with companies offering embedded finance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why OnePipe has six partner banks at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The caveat goes like this, the moment you make a positioning play for banking as a service, all you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need is one partner bank that lets you go deep because the embedded finance [offering] is about depth and not breadth,” said the CEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you go for data aggregation or open banking in general, then you are going for breadth, not depth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So on our side, we said we’d rather go with tier two and tier three bands, where once you describe the concept to them, they get it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It powers their growth and is more valuable to them, unlike other larger financial institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By running API infrastructure on behalf of these partner banks and helping them monetize it, OnePipe works with non-financial institutions to launch and cross-sell an array of financial services such as credit, accounts and payments within their offerings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We raised a round last year to focus on one use case of the partnership, which was to pull together the APIs of a fixed set of banks and offer embedded banking or banking as a service play,” Adeoye asserted. “Meaning, we make it possible for non-financial institutions, or businesses in general, to offer banking services to their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So an FMCG startup, for instance, can plug into a bank’s API managed by OnePipe and begin to issue accounts to customers, allowing them to make payments off those accounts and access credit when they need it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 10 months OnePipe switched up to this model, it has processed more than 6.3 million transactions worth over $46.3 million, the company said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These numbers are from over 1 million individual accounts and 138+ businesses, ranging from FMCG and retail to lending and agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnePipe takes a percentage cut from transactions made on these accounts and shares with its partner banks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For loans offered via its APIs, OnePipe takes at least 1% of the loan interest from its lending partners and also shares it with the businesses and partner banks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With what OnePipe has accomplished so far, Aniko Szigetvari, the founding partner at Atlantica Ventures, believes the company is not only deepening financial inclusion in Nigeria but the continent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In our view, embedded finance is the next enabler for both traditional and financial service businesses to increase customer loyalty and revenue by offering a wide range of third-party financial products and revenue streams for their customers,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though OnePipe is currently only present in Nigeria, it is making its first move beyond the country’s shores to align with Szigetvari’s statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OnePipe is going through a strategic partnership route as Adeoye mentioned that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his company made a deal with African logistics and freight company Sendy to expand into other African countries. Per the company’s statement, the plan is to “pull a Stripe-Shopify-esque tag team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We made sure that before we looked into other African countries, we were going in with a customer on the ground already,” said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We did a deal with Sendy that made them participate in this round, and we will then deploy the capital for expansion. So as they go to Egypt, South Africa, we’ll </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be deploying with them and grow together.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The International Digital Economy Academy (<a href="https://idea.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEA</a>) quietly opened<a href="http://www.sznews.com/content/mb/2021-06/03/content_24269733.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> last year</a>, perched among ultramodern office buildings on Shenzhen&#8217;s side of the river border with Hong Kong.</p>
<p>While geographically separated from Hong Kong, technically, the research institute is located inside a special area straddling the two cities: the <a href="https://www.itc.gov.hk/en/doc/collaboration/joint_policy_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shenzhen-Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Cooperation Zone</a>. The name is self-explanatory. It&#8217;s a joint effort by the governments of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, with support from Beijing and favorable policies, to collaborate on scientific and technological research.</p>
<p>IDEA is one of the organizations that have set up inside the<a href="https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/video/photo/content/post_322531.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 3.89 km² special zone</a> &#8212; which is about the size of 540 football pitches &#8212; and is a brainchild of Harry Shum. The renowned computer scientist was an executive vice president at Microsoft from 2013 to 2019 and also co-founded Microsoft&#8217;s largest research branch outside the U.S., Microsoft Research Asia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like his former colleague at Microsoft, Kai-Fu Lee, Shum was active in both the research and business sides of AI. Now at IDEA, his team aims to &#8220;develop disruptive innovative technologies based on social needs and give back to society in a way that allows more people to benefit from the development of the digital economy.&#8221; Several research directors at IDEA are also Microsoft veterans, including Yutao Xie and Jiaping Wang.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">sweeping regulatory clampdown</a> on China&#8217;s internet firms has led to headlines saying Beijing has turned against tech. But the government&#8217;s intent is more nuanced. It&#8217;s zeroing in on Big Tech deemed harmful to the society and economy, companies that have encouraged financial market risks, gaming addiction, exploitation of gig workers, and other ills.</p>
<p>In the meantime, China remains fixated on its goal to promote fundamental research and reduce reliance on Western technologies. In Shenzhen, home to tech giants like Huawei, DJI and Tencent, the government is recruiting world-class scientists. Harry Shum and his team are among the latest to have joined the raft.</p>
<p>IDEA definitely has a buzzy name (and a great acronym). The term &#8220;digital economy&#8221; comes up often in President Xi Jinping&#8217;s speeches on how technology can be a driving force for the economy. The &#8220;digital economy has become a key force in restructuring the global economy and transforming the global competitive landscape in recent years,&#8221; the President <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202110/20/WS616f4e77a310cdd39bc6fedc.html">said</a> in October. &#8220;The internet, big data, cloud computing and other technologies are being increasingly integrated into all sectors of economic and social development.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>IDEA is examining how AI can transform industries like finance, manufacturing and medical care. This week, it announced it&#8217;s <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Zs2BD5KXuYoomkGIdQlGcw">partnering with leading Chinese quant trader</a> Ubiquant on a joint lab to work on &#8220;risk monitoring and avoidance for financial transaction markets,&#8221; as well as &#8220;basic infrastructure for high-performance computing systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>IDEA is just one of the many research labs that have sprung up across Shenzhen in recent years. The <a href="https://side.cuhk.edu.cn/page/21">Shenzhen Institute of Data Economy</a>, located on the Shenzhen campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong with support from the government, is another group working to <a href="https://sme.cuhk.edu.cn/en/article/1340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advance</a> China&#8217;s digital economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kenya’s economy is powered by informal businesses, which contribute 33.8% to the country’s GDP and provide <a href="https://www.knbs.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Economic-Survey-2021.pdf">83.4%</a> of the total employment outside of small-scale agriculture, data from the country&#8217;s bureau of statistics shows. The contribution of these enterprises is pivotal to the country’s economy yet they remain underserved by traditional banking institutions making it hard for them to <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/262361468914023771/pdf/106986-WP-P151793-PUBLIC-Box.pdf">access the financing</a> needed to grow.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the financing gap left by conventional banking institutions has presented an opportunity for innovation, leading to the birth of fintechs like <a href="https://asilimia.co.ke/home">Asilimia</a>. The Kenyan startup has over the last three years been offering a lifeline to traders in Kenya by enabling them to make mobile money transactions that are devoid of transfer charges through its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asilimia-kenya-has-launched-leja-its-digital-app-manage-dogad-dogoui/?trk=public_profile_article_view">Leja app</a>.</p>
<p>And now, having secured $2 million in pre-seed funding ($1 million equity and $1 million debt), the startup is headed for its next phase of growth, which will involve extending loans to traders offering more relief to this subgroup that is often left out and regarded as high risk by the traditional banking sector.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238953" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding came from various investors including Fredrik Jung Abbou; a two-time unicorn founder and Norrsken Impact Accelerator, while the debt round had the participation of French Public Investment Bank (Bpifrance) and GreenTec Capital Partners.</p>
<p>Asilimia is set to use the funding to hire talent as it looks to fine tune its technology and to expand to another market within East Africa. It will also extend loans to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) based on data from its Leja app.</p>
<p>“We have entered a phase where we are exploring ways in which we can extend the much-needed credit enabling traders to buy equipment or products to sustain their enterprises,” Asilimia co-founder and CEO, Tekwane Mwendwa told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgane-kablan-957024120/?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAB3nQlMBAUGUT8-4BWi92LrqJQosM4Ndw80">Morgane Kablan</a>, is the startup’s other co-founder and chief operating officer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By providing mobile loans, Asilimia will join a space that has about 100 lending apps including Branch by San Francisco-based Branch International Ltd and PayPal-backed Tala.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239160" style="width: 6010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239160" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2239160 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg" alt="" width="6000" height="4000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Asilimia-founders-and-employees.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239160" class="wp-caption-text">Asilimia team in Nairobi, Kenya.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Asilimia.</p></div></p>
<p>The Digital Lenders Association of Kenya told TechCrunch in a past interview that about 25 apps it represents disburse about $40 million a month. The apps offer collateral-free loans making them attractive to borrowers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/kenya-cracks-down-on-digital-lenders-over-data-privacy-issues/">looking for quick cash</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to enabling users to make mobile money transactions at no fee, Leja also supports bookkeeping, making it easier for the traders to track their revenues and outflows, without the need for technical or accounting knowledge. The platform provides valuable data that Asilimia plans to tap to extend loans to users.</p>
<p>Mwendwa said that Asilimia will create credit scoring models from the collected data to determine how much will be extended to borrowers.</p>
<p>“We will factor in their b2b transactions, cash flow, sales, liabilities and expenses because all this information is in the app. This is possible because traders love to use our app which, unlike other lending apps, has inventory management. I like to think of our app as the operating system of informal businesses and we are happy that it is a one-stop shop for the traders,” said Mwendwa.</p>
<p>“Another thing that traders struggle with is airtime top-up. We interact with them daily and understand their pain points, and so we want to give them all the support they need so that they can continue doing business &#8211; we will also extend airtime top up credit at no interest,” he said.</p>
<p>Tekwane said that a normal user makes about three transactions through the app every day and the business has been growing 30% week on week. About 27,000 users use its apps, with total transactions done through the Leja app reaching about $20 million.</p>
<p>Previously, the startup has been through the prestigious Station F incubation program in Paris and the Norrsken Impact Accelerator program. In 2019, the startup won the Africa Cup at the 2019 SA Innovation Summit, securing a $350,000 investment from Unicorn Group, a pan-African investment firm. It used the financing to fund its growth which included adding Leja to its portfolio.</p>
<p>Beyond East Africa, Asilimia is exploring growth opportunities in other regions, as it seeks to continue bridging the financing gap currently experienced by traders across the continent.</p>
<p>“MSMEs play a vital role across Africa and making it easier for them to succeed is great for the continent as a whole,” said Norrsken Impact Accelerator co-founder and managing director Funda Sezgi.</p>
<p>“Tekwane and the team have built a solution that works and we are delighted to be supporting them as they drive prosperity in a key sector for the African economy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever visited the site of the six-year-old, London-based direct-to-consumer clothing company <a href="https://www.vollebak.com/">Vollebak</a>, you&#8217;ve likely marveled at the exaggerated descriptions of clothing it sells, including a jacket &#8220;designed for a world of megastorms, where &#8216;waterproof&#8217; is not enough,&#8221; a hoodie that promises to repel rain, wind, snow and fire; and and an &#8220;ice age&#8221; fleece &#8220;designed to recreate the feeling and performance of the soft hides worn by prehistoric man.&#8221;</p>
<p>That marketing genius comes directly from CEO Steve Tidball, who cofounded the outfit with his twin, Nick Tidball &#8212; both of whom worked in advertising previously and both of whom are active outdoorsmen, though their families and the growth of Vollebak have kept them closer to home in recent years. Indeed, Steve Tidball writes the copy himself, he revealed last week in an interview about Vollebak, a brand that prides itself on making &#8220;clothes for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>During that chat, he also answered our questions about how much tech is actually involved in the clothing&#8217;s production. And he let us know that Vollebak has so far raised around $10 million in outside funding, including through a Series A round that is about to close, led by the London-based venture firm <a href="https://www.venrex.partners/">Venrex</a>, with participation from Airbnb cofounder Joe Gebbia, and Headspace CFO Sean Brecker, among others. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You started this company with your twin, Nick. So much of its genius seems to be in how your clothing is marketed. Tell us a bit about how it came together.</strong></p>
<p>ST: We launched the company five years ago. Before that, we&#8217;d been working together in advertising for 15 years, so I think one of the reasons the marketing is more fun than it might otherwise be is that was our job.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve operated by an incredibly simple rule from a marketing perspective, which is basically: spend as little money as humanly possible. So, for instance, a couple years ago, we created our first piece of clothing for space, which was a deep sleep cocoon. And in marketing, you&#8217;re always [asking] who&#8217;s your audience, and really, our audience was one person here, which was Elon [Musk], so we found a billboard [space] opposite SpaceX, and we just took out a poster there, and it said, &#8220;Our jackets are ready. How&#8217;s your rocket going?&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t cost much money, but it was really great fun, and NASA called the next week, and then we got [to] chatting to them.</p>
<p><strong>Your clothing is a reflection of the stuff that you think is going to happen to people over the next century, from space travel to sustainability.  You have a solar charge jacket that you say can glow like a firefly in the dark, for example. You have a &#8220;black squid&#8221; jacket that you say recreates one of nature&#8217;s most brilliant solutions to high visibility, the adaptive camouflage of the squid. How much tech is really involved here?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the last five years, the angle of tech we focused on is material science. That&#8217;s the one thing that, as a startup, we&#8217;ve had access to, because if you&#8217;re going to look at much [complex] technologies like AI or exoskeletons, you need a really huge amount of funding to go tackle those, whereas any startup can really go and look at material science. So that&#8217;s the angle we&#8217;re really fascinated with . ..[because]  that&#8217;s typically not been explored, how much material science could go into a product.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things we ever launched was the world&#8217;s first graphene jacket. Even the scientists who isolated graphene for the first time can&#8217;t actually tell you what graphene is going to do.  . . .[So] we said, well, one side has graphene and the other side doesn&#8217;t. Why don&#8217;t you go out and test it and tell us what it does? We had a theory that it could store and redistribute heat because graphene behaves in a very surprising way and there&#8217;s no limit to how much heat it can store. What came back were two particularly amazing stories, one of a U.S. doctor who&#8217;d been freezing at night in the Gobi Desert and who wrapped his graphene jacket around a camel, and after it absorbed the heat of the camel, he put his jacket back on and stayed warm through the night.</p>
<p>Another friend of ours, a Russian guy who was out in the Nepalese mountains and was in danger of freezing to death, used the graphene jacket to absorb the last rays of sun. It warmed up, and he put it on as his inner layer and credits it with keeping him warm through the night.</p>
<p><strong>How do you manufacture a graphene shirt or ceramic shirt? Do you have a special loom? Do you make it out of a 3d printer? What&#8217;s the process?</strong></p>
<p>You manufacture it with great difficulty is the answer, which is why our stuff costs more than regular clothing. What you really end up with is very specialist factories, typically in Europe, with really high tech machinery that very few people have access to.</p>
<p><strong>Do you typically do short production runs for your merchandise?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and at the start, that was really just a function of capital, meaning we didn&#8217;t have much, so we just made as many clothes as we could, they sold out really quickly, and we tried to make some more as the business has grown. There&#8217;s definitely stuff where it&#8217;s so complicated or so experimental, it would be reckless to make 10,000 of them. So yeah, we&#8217;ve made short runs of some of our most experimental stuff, just to see: does it work? Could it be improved?</p>
<p><strong>One of those experimental new products is the Mars jacket and pants. Where does one wear that?</strong></p>
<p>Of the funny things about making anything for Mars is that the irony, of course, that you have to test it on Earth. But the reality of going to Mars or any space travel is there&#8217;s going to be an exponential increase in the number of people going there and the number of jobs they need to do when they go there. You&#8217;re going to need scientists, biologists, builders, engineers, architects, they&#8217;re gonna have to wear something. And so the reality is, we want to start working on it early, so what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re starting to think about some of the tasks that need to be carried out, whether it&#8217;s on the moon or Mars or lower orbit stuff, and about: what are the jobs? What are some of the challenges that we&#8217;re going to face? This is why the jacket comes with a vomit pocket, because your vestibular system is thrown into disarray as soon as you encounter a lack of gravity.</p>
<p><strong>How do you know about the vestibular system? You&#8217;re a marketing genius. Are you also a scientist?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a pretend scientist [laughs]. But we have a lot of really interesting people around us, whether it&#8217;s people who think about the future of warfare, or people who think about the future of space travel, we often joke that our business is run on WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you receive most of your customer feedback? C</strong><strong>ertain D2C brands that are very active on social and Instagram and have Slack channels. How do things work over there?</strong></p>
<p>I had this really early thought that if you could combine really cool innovative technology with really friendly people on the end of email, that could be a really cool thing.</p>
<p><strong>You only sell directly through the Vollebak site. Will that ever change?</strong></p>
<p>Not in the near term future. One of the things that&#8217;s been absolutely central to the brand is getting that feedback, and I really worry about losing that connection to the customers. Let&#8217;s say someone has a cool experience with one of our shirts or one of our jackets, and they bought it at some wholesale store, and they have no real connection to us. I feel that&#8217;s lost information.</p>
<p>We will be doing more stuff in the metaverse space very, very soon, because I just find it so exciting, the idea that there&#8217;s going to be this competition or integration between the virtual world and real world. So we&#8217;re currently building some fairly crazy stuff in that space. We&#8217;re currently on the hunt for some supercomputers powerful enough to process some of the stuff we&#8217;re working on. But yet basically, anything that we think is going to define the future, we&#8217;ll plow pretty heavily into.</p>
