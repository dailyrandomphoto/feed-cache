										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hicharlie.com/">Charlie</a>, a personal finance app that began as a chatbot, is relaunching today with a revamped experience focused on the larger goal of helping everyday Americans get out of debt. To do so, Charlie presents users with a full picture of their current debt and how long it will take them to pay it off. Users then connect their bank account to Charlie for personalized assistance in reducing their bills. It also &#8220;gamifies&#8221; saving money to make the process of setting money aside for paying down debt more fun.</p>
<p>According to Charlie CEO Ilian Georgiev, the idea to turn saving into more of game arose from his prior experience in the mobile gaming industry. At a company called Pocket Gems, he helped scale apps that generated millions of dollars in revenue growth from across millions of users.</p>

<p>&#8220;A really well-designed mobile game gets people to obsessively manage a virtual economy,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;And what I was curious about was how do we get people to do better in the real-world economy by using the same kind of tools?&#8221;</p>
<p>To help on that front, Charlie&#8217;s team includes people with backgrounds in not only computer science and engineering, but also in psychology. Using similar psychological tricks as found in gaming &#8212; rules, progress bars and reward mechanisms &#8212; the app helps nudge its users towards saving.</p>
<p>The original version of the Charlie app, launched in 2016, worked a little differently, however. It would analyze transaction data to look for areas where the user could improve their finances. It also worked over texting and through Facebook Messenger &#8212; platforms Charlie adopted with the idea that users needed a simpler way to connect with their finances.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the thing that we kept hearing over and over again, both qualitatively and quantitatively, is that the biggest concern that our users had is &#8216;how do I get out of debt? So then we said, instead of casting this really wide net&#8230;let&#8217;s laser focus on this one particular problem,&#8221; says Georgiev.</p>
<p>Today, the chatbot still lives on as a feature inside the new Charlie app, but it&#8217;s not the core experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101233" style="width: 385px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101233" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2101233" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.-Debt-calc-Savings.png?w=375" alt="" width="375" height="647" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.-Debt-calc-Savings.png 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.-Debt-calc-Savings.png?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.-Debt-calc-Savings.png?resize=174,300 174w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.-Debt-calc-Savings.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101233" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Charlie</p></div></p>
<p>Instead, users begin by providing the app with information about their debt. Georgiev stresses that many Americans often know their debt down to the penny &#8212; whether that&#8217;s how much they have left on student loans, how much left on their car, how much credit card debt they have, and so on.</p>
<p>The app then calculates how long it would take to pay off this debt if you only made minimum payments. This number helps shock people into action, as they&#8217;ll often discover they&#8217;re going to be in debt for another 40 or 50 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;For most users, that&#8217;s an epiphany because they&#8217;ve never seen these numbers before, and the math required &#8212; even if you do it in Excel &#8212; the math required to figure that out is beyond most people,&#8221; Georgiev says.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2101232" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Custom-rules-Customize.png?w=375" alt="" width="375" height="643" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Custom-rules-Customize.png 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Custom-rules-Customize.png?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Custom-rules-Customize.png?resize=175,300 175w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Custom-rules-Customize.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p>The app then encourages users to learn how they can reduce the time it would take them to get out of debt by paying more than the minimums. By clicking a button, they can visualize the what happens if you pay, for example, $20 or $50 more per month.</p>
<p>The final step is to help users find that extra cash. In part, this may come from savings the app locates on users&#8217; behalf. But it also comes from the money-saving &#8220;game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie helps users create autosave rules which, when applied, auto-transfer money from the user&#8217;s connected bank account to Charlie&#8217;s digital wallet (an account held at partner bank, Evolve). These can be fun rules or even sort of ridiculous ones. For example, you could create &#8220;Guilty Pleasures&#8221; rules where Charlie will put away 10% every time you eat McDonalds, or it could save $1 for you every time a contestant on &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; says they&#8217;re &#8220;here for the right reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101229" style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101229" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2101229" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Autosave-Savings-So-Far.png?w=279" alt="" width="279" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Autosave-Savings-So-Far.png 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Autosave-Savings-So-Far.png?resize=62,150 62w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Autosave-Savings-So-Far.png?resize=123,300 123w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Autosave-Savings-So-Far.png?resize=279,680 279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.-Autosave-Savings-So-Far.png?resize=21,50 21w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101229" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Charlie</p></div></p>
<p>As those rules apply, money is saved and a little progress bar fills. The app rewards you with rainbow confetti as you achieve, also similar to some mobile gaming experiences.</p>
<p>At the end of the month, the user can take that saved money to make a larger payment towards their debt. Currently, Charlie doesn&#8217;t manage the bill pay aspects itself &#8212; which is a limitation. You have to transfer the funds back to your bank. But a bill pay feature is due to arrive in a couple&#8217; months time, we&#8217;re told.</p>
<p>Later this year, Charlie plans to offer debt refinancing services to users. In this case, the team believes they can give the users lower interest rates because Charlie users will have proven, through their use of the app, that they&#8217;re lower risk.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2101235" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Celebration.png?w=375" alt="" width="375" height="667" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Celebration.png 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Celebration.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Celebration.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-Celebration.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p>Further down the road, Charlie aims to move more into neobank territory by issuing a debit card to users that works with users&#8217; Charlie account. To differentiate from the growing number of neobanks, Charlie will continue to focus on paying down debt and savings.</p>
<p>Georgiev notes that the app&#8217;s business model is not built around user data collection, however. Data that&#8217;s ingested is sanitized and encrypted, and the app has a strict privacy policy. Plus, Charlie mainly helps people save money, but those funds are actually stored with a partner bank, not in Charlie itself. And because it&#8217;s involved in the act of moving money, it has to adhere to regulations around security and fraud prevention.</p>
<p>Today, Charlie charges a $4.99 per month subscription, which the company aims to make up for by helping people reduce their larger debt loads more quickly. However, even that small amount could give money-sensitive users pause, despite Charlie&#8217;s perks and successes.</p>
<p>To date, Charlie has registered a half million users for its older chatbot experience. It hopes to now grow that figure with its new tools.</p>
<p>The app is available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1488679662?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hicharlie.chat">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.finesse.us">Finesse</a>, a startup promising to take the guesswork and waste out of fashion, is announcing that it has raised $4.5 million in seed and pre-seed funding.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Ramin Ahmari said the tremendous waste in the fashion industry has become a badly-kept secret, with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44885983">Burberry recently facing a backlash</a> over its practice of burning unwanted products, and the industry as a whole producing <a href="https://theprettyplaneteer.com/fashion-industry-waste/">an estimated 13 million tons of textile waste</a> each year.</p>
<p>Finesse is looking to change that, Ahmari said, in part by taking advantage of the fact that that fashion trends are moving out of the &#8220;hermetically sealed&#8221; world of fashion catwalks and onto social media, where new products take off &#8220;on the backs and bodies and posts&#8221; of influencers like Kylie Jenner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is data we have access to,&#8221; he said. Noting that he previously worked in finance, Ahmari added that the stock market is &#8220;much more unpredictable&#8221; than the fashion industry — there just hasn&#8217;t been a tech startup applying tools like natural language processing and deep learning to fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the simplest terms, you can think of what we do as seeing when Kylie posts a picture on Instagram and people go crazy about it &#8230; and then you see that happen not just on Kylie&#8217;s post but across Instagram, TikTok, Google Trends,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We predict the establishing of a trend before it goes super viral.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101242" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101242" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2101242" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Desktop-Lifestyle-1.jpg?w=662" alt="Finesse" width="662" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Desktop-Lifestyle-1.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Desktop-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=146,150 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Desktop-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=292,300 292w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Desktop-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=768,789 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Desktop-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=662,680 662w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Desktop-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=1495,1536 1495w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Desktop-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=1994,2048 1994w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Desktop-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Desktop-Lifestyle-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101242" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Finesse</p></div></p>
<p>Finesse then uses this data to design new products. Ahmari said that by taking advantage of a &#8220;very fast supply chain,&#8221; along with tools like<a href="https://www.clo3d.com"> CLO 3D modeling software</a>, Finesse can go from identifying a trend to having a product available for purchase in less than 25 days.</p>
<p>While the startup is officially launching today, it&#8217;s already been selling products through &#8220;drops,&#8221; where customers vote for and pre-order products that will only be available in limited quantities. Ahmari said Finesse focuses on selling unique pieces rather than staples, but because it&#8217;s confident about consumer demand, it can keep things much more affordable — the <a href="https://www.finesse.us/products">products currently for sale</a> range from $8 to $116.</p>
<p>And unlike most fashion companies, Ahmari said that Finesse does not need to employ a giant design department, although he suggested that team members like Vice President of Product Andrea Knopf and Head of Product Development Brittany Fleck — who work in tandem with the startup&#8217;s algorithms —are &#8220;artists in their own right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless we have true AI — which we&#8217;re very far from — you are never going to have a machine that’s purely creative,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have to have feedback cycles &#8230; What we are eliminating is the job where it’s just an intern doing grunt work, all of these people just going to through Instagram to find new fashion trends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahmari also said that with its emphasis on sustainability and connecting with the LGBTQ community (Ahmari identifies as queer and non-binary, and all of the startup&#8217;s products are designed for any gender), Finesse is aimed squarely at Gen Z consumers who are tired of fashion dictated by &#8220;white, older, cisgender men.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s investors include former Twitter head of engineering Alex Roetter, Collective Health CEO Ali Diab, Hoxton Ventures, MaC Venture Capital, Mango Capital and Fab Fit Fun co-founder Sam Teller.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that FINESSE is truly the future of fashion, from its trend prediction to sustainable supply-chain and manufacturing,&#8221; said MaC Managing Partner Marlon Nichols in a statement. &#8220;We hope other fashion brands can learn from FINESSE’s disruption in the space and we’re eager to see what’s next.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The top-line feature for Ring’s latest is no doubt its price. No way around that. At $60, it’s $40 cheaper than the standard Video Doorbell – and prices from there go up significantly, with the “Elite&#8221; running $350.</p>
<p>Perhaps the company is feeling some pressure from the race the bottom for smart home hardware pricing. Wyze, notably, has done the Wyze thing, launching a $30 doorbell along with a slew of other products in September. Though as of this writing, that device is still listed as a “pre-order.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbyzzEEIPKk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Wyze device was expected to be available this month, but has since been pushed back to February. The Ring Video Doorbell Wired is also currently slated for next month, with a shipping date of the 24th. As the name suggests, the new product is only available in a hardwired option – which could be a deal breaker for some. Other standard features here include 1080p video with night vision, motion zones that trigger notifications and two-way audio with noise cancelation built-in. It&#8217;s also the company&#8217;s smallest doorbell to date.</p>
<p>The Amazon-owned company is, of course, not without its share of controversy. Earlier this month, we noted a security flaw that exposed the locations and home addresses of people using its Neighbors app. There has also been plenty of concern around the brand’s willingness to partner with the law enforcement. A number of civil rights penned an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/over-30-civil-rights-groups-demand-an-end-to-amazon-rings-police-partnerships/">open letter in 2019</a>. Earlier this year, Ring finally enabled end-to-end encryption that requires user opt-in.</p>
<p>The new doorbell will be available through Amazon (naturally) and will be a Home Depot in-store exclusively through late-March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://pinecone.io">Pinecone</a>, a new startup from the folks who helped launch Amazon SageMaker, has built a vector database that generates data in a specialized format to help build machine learning applications faster, something that was previously only accessible to the largest organizations. Today the company came out of stealth with a new product and announced a $10 million seed investment led by Wing Venture Capital.</p>
<p>Company co-founder Edo Liberty says that he started the company because of this fundamental belief that the industry was being held back by the lack of wider access to this type of database. &#8220;The data that a machine learning model expects isn&#8217;t a JSON record, it&#8217;s a high dimensional vector that is either a list of features or what&#8217;s called an embedding that&#8217;s a numerical representation of the items or the objects in the world. This [format] is much more semantically rich and actionable for machine learning,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>He says that this is a concept that is widely understood by data scientists, and supported by research, but up until now only the biggest and technically superior companies like Google or Pinterest could take advantage of this difference. Liberty and his team created Pinecone to put that kind of technology in reach of any company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup spent the last couple of years building the solution, which consists of three main components. The main piece is a vector engine to convert the data into this machine-learning ingestible format. Liberty says that this is the piece of technology that contains all the data structures and algorithms that allow them to index very large amounts of high dimensional vector data, and search through it in an efficient and accurate way.</p>
<p>The second is a cloud hosted system to apply all of that converted data to the machine learning model, while handling things like index lookups along with the pre- and post-processing &#8212; everything a data science team needs to run a machine learning project at scale with very large workloads and throughputs. Finally, there is a management layer to track all of this and manage data transfer between source locations.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tecton.ai nabs $35M Series B as it releases machine learning feature store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/tecton-ai-nabs-35m-series-b-as-it-releases-machine-learning-feature-store/embed/#?secret=zBFk6liPax" data-secret="zBFk6liPax" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One classic example Liberty uses is an eCommerce recommendation engine. While this has been a standard part of online selling for years, he believes using a vectorized data approach will result in much more accurate recommendations and he says the data science research data bears him out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to be that deploying [something like a recommendation engine] was actually incredibly complex, and [&#8230;] if you have access to a production grade database, 90% of the difficulty and heavy lifting in creating those solutions goes away, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re building this. We believe it&#8217;s the new standard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company currently has 10 people including the founders, but the plan is to double or even triple that number, depending on how the year goes. As he builds his company as an immigrant founder &#8212; Liberty is from Israel &#8212; he says that diversity is top of mind. He adds that it&#8217;s something he worked hard on at his previous positions at Yahoo and Amazon as he was building his teams at those two organizations. One way he is doing that is in the recruitment process. &#8220;We have instructed our recruiters to be proactive [in finding more diverse applicants], making sure they don&#8217;t miss out on great candidates, and that they bring us a diverse set of candidates,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to post-pandemic, Liberty says he is a bit more traditional in terms of office versus home, and that he hopes to have more in-person interactions. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m old fashioned but I like offices and I like people and I like to see who I work with and hang out with them and laugh and enjoy each other&#8217;s company, and so I&#8217;m not jumping on the bandwagon of &#8216;let&#8217;s all be remote and work from home&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

SAP&#8217;s head of product success Sven Denecken [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SAP today announced a new offering it calls &#8216;<a href="https://www.sap.com/about/events/rise-with-sap.html">RISE with SAP</a>,&#8217; a solution that is meant to help the company&#8217;s customers go through their respective digital transformations and become what SAP calls &#8216;intelligent enterprises.&#8217; RISE is a subscription service that combines a set of services and product offerings.</p>
<p>SAP&#8217;s head of product success Sven Denecken (and its COO for S/4Hana) described it as &#8220;the best concierge service you can get for your digital transformation&#8221; when I talked to him earlier this week. &#8220;We need to help our clients to embrace that change that they see currently,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Transformation is a journey. Every client wants to become that smarter, faster and that nimbler business, but they, of course, also see that they are faced with challenges today and in the future. This continuous transformation is what is happening to businesses. And we do know from working together with them, that actually they agree with those fundamentals. They want to be an intelligent enterprise. They want to adapt and change. But the key question is how to get there? And the key question they ask us is, please help us to get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>With RISE for SAP, businesses will get a single contact at SAP to help guide them through their journey, but also access to the SAP partner ecosystem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The first step in this process, Denecken stressed, isn&#8217;t necessarily to bring in new technology, though that is also part of it, but to help businesses redesign and optimize their business processes and implement the best practices in their verticals &#8212; and then measure the outcome. &#8220;Business process redesign means that you analyze how your business processes perform. How can you get tailored recommendations? How can you benchmark against industry standards? And this helps you to set the tone and also to motivate your people &#8212; your IT, your business people &#8212; to adapt,&#8221; Denecken described. He also noted that in order for a digital transformation project to succeed, IT and business leaders and employees have to work together.</p>
<p>In part, that includes technology offerings and adopting robotic process automation (RPA), for example. As Denecken stressed, all of this builds on top of the work SAP has done with its customers over the years to define business processes and KPIs.</p>
<p>On the technical side, SAP is obviously offering its own services, including its <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html">Business Technology Platform</a>, and cloud infrastructure, but it will also support customers on all of the large cloud providers. Also included in RISE is support for more than 2,200 APIs to integrate various on-premises, cloud and non-SAP systems, access to SAP&#8217;s low-code and no-code capabilities and, of course, its database and analytics offerings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geopolitical tensions, environmental challenges and the ongoing pandemic are forcing businesses to deal with change faster than ever before,” said Christian Klein, SAP&#8217;s CEO, in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Companies that can adapt their business processes quickly will thrive – and SAP can help them achieve this. This is what RISE with SAP is all <a name="m_-7067269608981192402__Hlk62241131"></a>about: It helps customers continuously unlock new ways of running businesses in the cloud to stay ahead of their industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this new offering, SAP is now providing its customers with a number of solutions that were previously available through its partner ecosystem. Denecken doesn&#8217;t see this as SAP competing with its own partners, though. Instead, he argues that this is very much a partner play and that this new solution will likely only bring more customers to its partners as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Needless to say, this has been a negotiation with those partners,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because yes, it&#8217;s sometimes topics that we now take over they [previously] did. But we are looking for scale here. The need in the market for digital transformation has just started. And this is where we see that this is definitely a big offering, together with partners. &#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gamestop shares are set to rally 70% this morning when trading starts, and AMC shares opened up 300%, extending a run that has perplexed market observers, irked hedge funds, and generally made crypto&#8217;s recent gains appear soft and weak.</p>
<p>Being a retail trader is mostly being a sucker, hoping to best the markets while lacking the infrastructure, access, and information that professionals enjoy. Hell, most professional fund managers that regular folks can invest in fail to beat the market. That&#8217;s one reason why index funds and other passive investments that merely track aggregate performance have grown so much in recent years; why pay more to have someone make you less money than simply making the same returns as the S&amp;P 500?</p>
<p>Things have changed some in recent years. Robinhood <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/spurred-by-robinhood-trading-fees-fall-among-old-guard-brokers/">blew up the trading fee economy</a>, and now along with a host of similar companies &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">Public.com with its social focus</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/">Freetrade in the UK</a>, and so forth &#8212; has made retail investing far more accessible than it was before to more folks. And we&#8217;re all trapped inside. And a rude, jokey Reddit forum has gone from in-nerd joke to front-page news after its users started to push their weight around.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s something that was noted by none other than the founder of Reddit Alexis Ohanian who shared some thoughts on Twitter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">And it&#39;s a perfect storm at a time when lots of people are hurting, interest rates are so low, inescapable student loan debts loom, and every major institution has caught Ls during a /global pandemic/ over the last year. This is something to believe in.</p>
<p>&mdash; Alexis Ohanian Sr. 7&#xfe0f;&#x20e3;7&#xfe0f;&#x20e3;6&#xfe0f;&#x20e3; (@alexisohanian) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1354407436732387335?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s an old saw that back in the dotcom boom traders would congregate in chat rooms to share tips, lie to each other, and try to pump their own equities higher. That all still happens. But what has changed is that the combination of mature social platforms and free trading has at once boosted access to the public markets <em>while</em> Reddit and other online congregation points have provided a simpler way for retail investors, the <em>hoi polloi</em>, to fuck around and make other people find out.</p>
<p>Again, Ohanian&#8217;s thoughts on this resonate.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A couple hundred thousand years of evolution conditioned us to believe in and rally around the immediate tribe around us. The idea of an &#8216;institution&#8217; &#8211; a faceless, nameless entity we just have to trust &#8212; is actually pretty foreign to our species,&#8221; </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1354407438473076737?s=20">the venture investor wrote on Twitter</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I know they&#8217;re all &#8216;random people on the internet&#8217; but there&#8217;s a lot more empathy and community there than people realize. It&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been saying for 15 years that (online) community is still massively undervalued.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>This is what has happened with Gamestop, a company that until recently was unnotable, and stuck between a physical retail footprint, the pandemic, and its customers increasingly preferring digital game purchases. It was worth around $4 per share last summer. It started 2021 worth around $18. Now it&#8217;s $147.98 after rising 92.7% yesterday, and is up $69.02 this morning, or 46.6%.</p>
<p>How did that happen? No, the company did not get suddenly, radically stronger in short order. Instead, a coterie of Reddit users realized that Gamestop was shorted by more than 100%. That means that investors had bet more shares than existed in the company that it would lose value.</p>
<p>And mostly this would have been fine, a quirk of the market; other highly-shorted stocks <a href="https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-heavily-shorted-stocks-primed-for-epic-squeezes-analysts-say-gamestop/">can see a majority of their shares sold short</a>, but to see a short-percentage of greater than 100% was eyebrow-raising.</p>
<p>Then came the wager: If big investors had bet more shares than Gamestop had in existence that it would lose value, what would happen if lots of individuals investors &#8212; retail interest, as they say &#8212; started <em>buying</em> the stock? That might drive its value up, forcing the hedge funds and other big capital pools to decide whether to hold onto their negative bet and take strong paper losses as Gamestop rallied, or cover their short, buying the stock at a higher price than they initially paid for it, losing money. Covering shorts would require buying the stock at high prices, perhaps boosting its value yet again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the wildest short-squeeze we can recall.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always tension between short-sellers and investors who prefer to make positive wagers. Indeed, shorts are generally hated and the term <em>perma-bear</em>, slang for someone who is chronically worried about the price of assets to the point of distraction,<sup>1</sup> is often levied at them.</p>
<p>But <em>a boom in retail investing </em>and<em> social platforms allowing the congregation of disparate individual investors </em>can do quite a lot, it turns out. So, users of the WallStreetBets sub-Reddit started buying Gamestop. And they kept doing so, pushing its price higher and higher.</p>
<p>The result was that big money got smacked in the shorts, literally. CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/gamestop-shares-are-jumping-again-but-short-sellers-arent-backing-down.html">reports</a> that short-sellers have lost more than $5 billion so far thanks to Gamestop&#8217;s rapid appreciation on the back of becoming an internet meme.</p>
<p>But the tug-of-war between professionals betting that Gamestop is not worth its inflated price, and that it will fall, is not over. Short interest remains high. So, even if some pro investors have cried uncle and exited their trade, the retail revenge on the so-called smart money is hardly a sure thing; what those excitable individuals may have done is merely set up a more enticing short position for hedge funds than had existed before.</p>
<p>Gamestop has a lot further to fall from over $140 per share than it did from $18, say.</p>
<p>Of course no one knows what will happen today. The investors who have taken out more short positions during the rally are set to eat their own ties this morning when Gamestop opens higher. Perhaps they will hold, and eventually their short bet will pay off. Or perhaps retail will be able to keep rallying Gamestop until, well, no one really knows.</p>
<p>But while most folks have their retirement accounts in investments so boring you&#8217;ve forgotten their names &#8212; Fidelity Freedom 2060 Fund, or what have you &#8212; small-time investors are sticking it to the man. This is the political war underneath the trading scrap. Retail is generally said to be mad at being pushed around, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp">front-run</a>, and generally speaking operating as second-class investing citizens. The Gamestop gambit is, to some degree, revenge.</p>
<p>Not that it will matter, per se, in the long-term. Large investing groups will still crush retail, having access to better information and tools and the like, as we mentioned up top. But today, at least, those same concerns are going to start the day with huge paper losses on their Gamestop shorts.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s hilarious, because the company is obviously overvalued and individuals simply do not give a fuck.</p>
<ol>
<li>I, Alex Wilhelm, am like this before coffee.</li>

<p>&#8220;We believe it’s no longer just about personalizing the experience or driving recommendations,&#8221; Atzberger said. &#8220;The brand and word Optimizely really signifies optimal performance. Companies today of any size, any scale [need to be] much more sophisticated in terms of how they digitally connect with their customers. It&#8217;s a never-ending story.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, he emphasized that Episerver is making the change from &#8220;a position of strength,&#8221; with the combined company seeing double-digit revenue growth last year and going live with more than 250 new customers.</p>
<p>Asked whether adopting the Optimizely name was always part of the post-acquisition plan, Atzberger replied, &#8220;When we acquired Optimizely, we knew that we would be acquiring not just a great product, not just a great customer base, but also acquiring a very well-known brand. We had not yet decided on [rebranding], but it was certainly something that, for me, was part of the consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to announcing the new company name, Episerver/Optimizely is also announcing a new platform that it&#8217;s calling Optimization-as-a-Service, which integrates aspects of Optimizely and Episerver products to offer web targeting, testing and recommendations. As Atzberger put it, this new platform allows customers to determine &#8220;who to show something to, what content to show and how to actually show this content.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Days after the billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya announced his involvement in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-for-sunlight-financial-is-another-sign-of-a-renewables-boom/">$1.3 billion acquisition of the solar and home improvement lending business Sunlight Financial</a>, a collection of investors announced a nearly $1 billion cash infusion into <a href="https://loanpal.com/">Loanpal</a>, another renewable energy and home improvement lender.</p>
<p>The $800 million commitment to Loanpal arrives alongside a flurry of climate commitments from some of the world&#8217;s largest investors.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Blackrock chief Larry Fink, <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">released the $9 trillion investment manager&#8217;s annual letter</a> calling for more stringent accounting and reporting of climate data, and Bank of America joined 60 other companies <a href="https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2021/01/global-business-leaders-support-esg-convergence-by-committing-to.html">in committing to a new reporting standard for climate and sustainability</a> endorsed by the International Business Council and the World Economic Forum. Fink endorses a separate reporting scheme called the <a href="https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/">Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures</a> that has the backing of some of the biggest financial investors in the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KWAQtajDSI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-for-sunlight-financial-is-another-sign-of-a-renewables-boom/">Chamath Palihapitiya&#8217;s SPAC for Sunlight Financial is another sign of a renewables boom</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chamath Palihapitiya&#8217;s SPAC for Sunlight Financial is another sign of a renewables boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-for-sunlight-financial-is-another-sign-of-a-renewables-boom/embed/#?secret=KWAQtajDSI" data-secret="KWAQtajDSI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These new standards will drive more investment dollars into businesses that are reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change. And lending programs incentivizing the switch to more energy efficient appliances and renewable installations are probably the lowest of low hanging fruit for the financial services industry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one reason why investors like <span style="font-weight: 400;"> NEA, the WestCap Group, Brookfield Asset Management, and the giant private equity energy investment fund Riverstone Holdings are backing Loanpal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal, which was a secondary transaction to give strategic investors a stake in the business actually wrapped up last year. As a result Scott Sandell, the managing general partner at NEA and a longtime investor in pr and Laurence Tosi, Managing Partner of WestCap Group, have joined the company’s board of directors.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We invited a number of players into the company,&#8221; said Loanpal&#8217;s founder, chairman and chief executive Hayes Barnard. The former chief revenue officer for SolarCity before its acquisition by Tesla, Barnard has a long history with solar energy development. At Loanpal he also had the balance sheet to take his pick among would-be investors. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a multi-billion dollar company,&#8221; said Barnard.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101183" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101183" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2101183" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg 3500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20190826-loanpal-110-Edit.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2101183" class="wp-caption-text">Loanpal founder chairman and chief executive, Hayes Barnard. Image Credit: Loanpal</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;This was us inviting strategic investors into the company and being thoughtful about where they could help and how they could help,&#8221; Barnard said.</p>
<p>Loanpal is profitable, has zero debt and throws off monthly dividends to its financial backers. &#8220;Today we finance $400 million a month for roughly 15,000 solar systems that are combined with battery systems,&#8221; says Barnard. In all, the company has arranged $5.9 billion in consumer finance loans since its launch in 2018. Loanpal also counts around 85% of the top solar firms as vendors and has a staff of around 12,000 sales professionals.</p>
<p>Those numbers allowed the company to bring in board members like Tosi, the former chief financial officer of the multi-billion dollar financial services firm, Blackstone. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">He really understands how to bring in capital markets at scale,&#8221; said Barnard. </span></p>
<p>If anything, the attention from Blackrock, Blackstone, Riverstone and all the financial services firms without references to stones or rocks in their name shows that this is a problem of capital at scale. Decarbonizing the global economy is a $10 trillion business, according to the World Economic Forum (or, for the retail investment crowd, the equivalent of roughly 66.7 billion Gamestops <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gamestop+share+price&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS896US897&amp;oq=gamestop+share+price&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i131i433l2j0l6.2291j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">at yesterday&#8217;s share price</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The near term market that we’re going to penetrate now is sustainable home solutions that’s a $100 billion market,&#8221; Barnard said. </span></p>
<p>A significant chunk of that $10 trillion is going to come from the development and integration of new consumer facing appliances and hardware to reduce the consumption of energy. &#8220;We believe the battery storage market, the smart thermostat market and the solar market are all intertwined and combined,&#8221; said Barnard. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall the most important thing is that this is just technology that is better. It was going to scale regardless of who was in the White House. These pieces of technology are better, they save homeowners money.. It’s kind of an IQ test if homeowners want to do it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://lynk.global/">Lynk</a>, a &#8220;knowledge-as-a-service&#8221; platform that connects clients with over 840,000 experts in a wide range of fields, announced today it has raised $24 million led by Brewer Lane Ventures and MassMutual Ventures, with participation from Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund. The company uses machine learning algorithms to match users, who include investment firms, Fortune 100 companies and government entities, with experts on its platform, helping connect them with people they would probably not find at traditional consultancies or by searching online.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the core of it, the search is a people search based on what you know, and not just where you work, to put it very simply,&#8221; co-founder and chief executive officer Peggy Choi told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2015, Lynk has now raised a total of $30 million. It has more than 200 employees across offices in eight cities: Hong Kong, New York City, Singapore, London, Mumbai, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Toronto and Manila. Its funding will be used for product launches and to expand in North America and China, where its seen demand grow over the past twelve months.</p>
<p>Lynk&#8217;s flagship product, Lynk Answers, is currently used by about 200 enterprise clients when their employees need to do research for projects including geographical expansion, product-market fit and due diligence, with many relying on the platform for on-the-ground research in areas they can&#8217;t travel to because of the pandemic. For example, investors talk with advisors on Lynk to understand new technology or the dynamics in a sector. Over the past few years, companies have used Lynk to help them react quickly to geopolitical changes, including events that affected their supply chain. Some sought supply chain experts when shipments got stuck in customs or they wanted to diversify their manufacturing by setting up factories in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Before Lynk, Choi worked in finance, including at Silver Lake in London and TPG in San Francisco. As an investor, &#8220;every day you have to do a lot of conversations with executives and different kinds of experts to learn about new industries or companies really quickly. Through that experience, I realized that talking to the right person makes a huge difference,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In contrast, Choi found herself at a loss when her parents wanted to launch an art gallery. &#8220;They had all these day-to-day business questions and sometimes they asked me because they thought I would know how to address it. But I don&#8217;t know either, I&#8217;m not the right person for them, so I had to find the right people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When I saw that contrast, I thought, what about using data to organize people in a way based on what they know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lynk, which monetizes by charging enterprise clients a subscription fee, fills the gap between traditional consultancies and consumer-oriented Q&amp;A platforms like Quora or China&#8217;s Zhihu. The platform also includes SaaS features that provide an alternative to email chains, like collaboration tools and auto-transcription for expert interviews so they can be organized, searched and referenced by a team.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Zhihu has become one of China&#8217;s biggest hubs for experts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/how-zhihus-become-one-of-chinas-biggest-hubs-for-experts/embed/#?secret=Wni8hqLUIr" data-secret="Wni8hqLUIr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lynk’s experts, who the platform calls “Knowledge Partners,” include C-suite executives, independent consultants, lawyers, engineers, financial analysts and scientists, among others. The company finds them through several channels, including digital marketing, a referral program for current Knowledge Partners and partnerships with groups, associations and institutions. Lynk vets experts before they are added to the platform, where they set their own rates.</p>
<p>When users have a question, Lynk’s search engine shows them a list of experts based on criteria like domain expertise and geography. Then they ask potential experts a couple of questions to see if they are the right match. Lynk uses data from those conversations, on an anonymized basis, to refine its search technology and make matching more accurate. Once users pick experts, they work with them in different ways. Most of the time they do a question-and-answer session. Sometimes that turns into speaker and workshop engagements or longer-term projects.</p>
<p>Choi said building an inclusive roster of experts is a priority for Lynk. The company&#8217;s team and board are divided equally between women and men and represent more than 20 nationalities. It wants to build a diverse database through initiatives like outreach programs and campaigns like <a href="https://lynk.global/in-the-news/lynk-launches-lynk-elite-expert-women-for-international-womens-day-2020">Lynk Elite Expert Women</a> to recruit people, including those who haven&#8217;t done consulting before.</p>
<p>“When we were running the [Lynk Elite Expert Women] campaign, we realized that a lot of people find it a very new way of being valued,” said Choi. “Especially if they&#8217;ve spent their entire life doing something, they also want to know what people want to know about their area.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://literati.com">Literati</a> has raised a $40 million Series B to pursue an unusual startup opportunity — namely, book clubs.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Jessica Ewing (a former product manager at Google) explained that the Austin-based company started out with book clubs for <a href="https://literati.com/kids/">kids</a>, before launching <a href="https://literati.com/book-clubs/">its Luminary brand</a> for adult book clubs last year. And the Luminary clubs live up to the name — they&#8217;re curated by notable figures such as activist and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, NBA star Stephen Curry, entrepreneur and philanthropist Sir Richard Branson, journalist Susan Orlean and the Joseph Campbell Foundation.</p>
<p>When you sign up for a Literati book club, you receive a print edition of each month&#8217;s selection with a note from the curator. You also get access to the Literati app, where you can discuss the book with other readers, and where curators host author conversations. For example, Curry is leading <a href="https://literati.com/book-clubs/stephen-curry/">a book club focused on nonfiction</a> about people who &#8220;transcend expectations&#8221; (he invested in Literati as well), while <a href="https://literati.com/book-clubs/malala/">Yousafzai chooses books by women</a> &#8220;with bold ideas from around the world.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ewing told me that she&#8217;s trying to build the first &#8220;new, innovative bookseller&#8221; since Amazon launched 25 years ago. And she&#8217;s doing that by focusing on curation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s too much choice, too many lists, it’s completely overwhelming for most people,&#8221; she said. She argued that it helps to enlist celebrities and other big names to do that curation: &#8220;Books are aspirational. No one aspires to play more video games, people aspire to read more &#8230; People want their books to be recommended by someone a little bit smarter than they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ewing&#8217;s hope for Literati is to create &#8220;the next great literary social network,&#8221; bridging the gap between celebrity-driven lists like <a href="https://www.oprah.com/app/books.html">Oprah&#8217;s Book Club</a> and <a href="https://hello-sunshine.com/book-club">Reese&#8217;s Book Club </a>and what she described as &#8220;the wine-and-cheese, super intimate model.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#8220;</span>I would love to see in-person meetups once we’re out of the COVID environment,&#8221; she added. &#8220;But I also think there&#8217;s everything in between. We&#8217;re enabling threaded discussions [in the app] right now, and it&#8217;s cool to have asynchronous conversations about the books.&#8221;</p>
<p>And on the children&#8217;s book side, Literati is also working to build personalization tools designed to recommend the best books for each child.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, this is one of the most exciting applications: How do we make this generation of kids love reading by pairing them with the right books?&#8221; Ewing said.</p>
<p>Literati previously raised $12 million in funding from Shasta Ventures and others, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/literati/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>. The new round was led by Aydin Senkut of Felicis Ventures, with participation from Dick Costolo and Adam Bain of 01 Advisors, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, Shasta, Silverton Partners, Springdale Ventures and, as previously noted, Stephen Curry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to start my own book club with <span class="il">Literati</span>, because their mission to better the world through reading naturally aligns with my values as an entrepreneur and father,” Curry said in a statement. “I was a fan before I was an investor, and am so proud to be a part of a company that works to better the lives of others, one book at a time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lottiefiles.com/">LottieFiles</a>, a platform for JSON-based Lottie animations, has raised a Series A of $9 million. The round was led by M12, Microsoft’s venture capital arm, with participation from returning investor 500 Startups.</p>
<p>Based in San Francisco and Kuala Lumpur, LottieFiles was founded in 2018. The platform includes Lottie creation, editing and testing tools, and a marketplace for animations. It now claims about one million users from 65,000 companies, including Airbnb, Google, TikTok, Disney and Netflix, and 300% year-over-year growth. The new funding brings its total raised to about $10 million.</p>
<p>Smaller than GIF or PNG graphics, Lottie animations also have the advantage of being scalable and interactive. It was <a href="https://airbnb.design/introducing-lottie/">introduced as an open-source library</a> by Airbnb engineers six years ago and quickly became popular with app developers because Lottie files can be used across platforms without additional coding and edited after shipping.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>LottieFiles co-founder and chief executive officer Kshitij Minglani told TechCrunch the startup originally started as a community for designers and developers, before adding tools, integrations and other resources. It launched its marketplace during the COVID-19 lockdown, with 70% of earnings going directly to creators, and also has a list of animators who are available for hire.</p>
<p>LottieFiles’ core platform and tools are currently pre-revenue, with plans to monetize later this year. &#8220;It’s not often a revolutionary format comes about and disrupts an entire industry, saving tons of precious design and development hours,&#8221; said Minglani. &#8220;We didn’t want to stunt the adoption of Lottie by monetizing early on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding will be used on LottieFiles’ product roadmap, expanding its infrastructure and increasing its global user base.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year ago, Starship Technologies had a couple hundred autonomous bots delivering burritos and pizzas to  students on college campuses and residents in a few neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The company — with $17 million of new capital in its coffers — has expanded its fleet five-fold since COVID-19 swept through the European and North American markets that it operates in. While COVID-19 delivered pain and chaos, including to Starship Technologies, the company has also experienced an uptick in demand as restaurants switched to a takeout and delivery-only model. Starship now has 1,000 autonomous delivery bots in its fleet.</p>
<p>Starship Technologies said last year it planned to expand to 100 universities by late summer 2021. That&#8217;s a leap from the 15 campuses it operates at today. Still, the company is expanding in just about every measurable way, including locations, volume of trips, fleet size and workforce, which now number 400 people. The company said it is bringing new college campuses on every month and has a robust pipeline that will come online as classes resume.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s recent $17 million raise, which was announced Tuesday, included investors TDK Ventures and Goodyear Ventures. The new investment brings Starship&#8217;s total funding to $102 million. Starship decline to share its valuation. The company also announced it has expanded to UCLA and Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Starship Technologies, which was launched in 2014 by Skype co-founders Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis, has grown from an enterprise that completed 5,000 deliveries in 2017 to 1 million by January of this year. It&#8217;s also expanded beyond college campuses and communities like Milton Keyes, UK to more towns, including a 5,000-household area in Northhampton, UK and the California cities of Mountain View and Modesto.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.classiq.io/">Classiq</a>, a Tel Aviv-based startup that aims to make it easier for computer scientists and developers to create quantum algorithms and applications, today announced that it has raised a $10.5 million Series A round led by Team8 Capital and Wing Capital. Entrée Capital, crowdfunding platform OurCrowd and Sumitomo Corporation (through IN Venture) also participated in this round, which follows the company&#8217;s recent $4 million seed round led by Entrée Capital.</p>
<p>The idea behind Classiq, which currently has just under a dozen members on its team, is that developing quantum algorithms remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, quantum software development is almost an impossible task,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nir-minerbi-6a1554176/?originalSubdomain=il">Nir Minerbi</a>, CEO and Co-founder of <span class="il">Classiq. &#8220;</span>The programming is at the gate level, with almost no abstraction at all. And on the other hand, for many enterprises, that&#8217;s exactly what they want to do: come up with game-changing quantum algorithms. So we built the next layer of the quantum software stack, which is the layer of a computer-aided design, automation, synthesis. [&#8230;] So you can design the quantum algorithm without being aware of the details and the gate level details are automated.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2101025" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101025" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2101025" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png 7688w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Classiq_UI-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2101025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Classiq</p></div></p>
<p>With Microsoft&#8217;s Q#, IBM&#8217;s Qiskit and their competitors, developers already have access to quantum-specific languages and frameworks. And as Amir Naveh, Classiq&#8217;s VP of R&amp;D told me, just like with those tools, developers will define their algorithms as code &#8212; in Classiq&#8217;s case a variant of Python. With those other languages, though, you will write sequences of gates on the cubits to define your quantum circuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you&#8217;re writing down isn&#8217;t gates on cubits, its concepts, its constructs, its constraints &#8212; it&#8217;s always constraints on what you want the circuit to achieve,&#8221; Naveh explained. &#8220;And then the circuit is synthesized from the constraints. So in terms of the visual interface, it would look the same [as using other frameworks], but in terms of what&#8217;s going through your head, it&#8217;s a whole different level of abstraction, you&#8217;re describing the circuit at a much higher level.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, he said, gives Classiq&#8217;s users the ability to more easily describe what they are trying to do. For now, though, that also means that the platform&#8217;s users tend to be quantum teams and scientists and developers who are quantum experts and understand how to develop quantum circuits at a very deep level. The team argues, though, that as the technology gets better, developers will need to have less and less of an understanding of how the actual qubits behave.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/442845321" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>As Minerbi stressed, the tool is agnostic to the hardware that will eventually run these algorithms. Classiq&#8217;s mission, after all, is to provide an additional abstraction layer on top of the hardware. At the same time, though, developers can optimize their algorithms for specific quantum computing hardware as well.</p>
<p>Classiq CTO Dr. Yehuda Naveh also noted that the company is already working with a number of larger companies. These include banks that have used its platform for portfolio optimization, for example, and a semiconductor firm that was looking into a material science problem related to chip manufacturing, an area that is a bit of a sweet spot for quantum computing &#8212; at least in its current state.</p>
<p>The team plans to use the new funding to expand its existing team, mostly on the engineering side. A lot of the work the company is doing, after all, is still in R&amp;D. Finding the right software engineers with a background in physics &#8212; or quantum information experts who can program &#8212; will be of paramount importance for the company. Minerbi believes that is possible, though, and the plan is to soon expand the team to about 25 people.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;We are thrilled to be working with <span class="il">Classiq</span>, assisting the team in achieving their goals of advancing the quantum computing industry,&#8221; said Sarit Firon, Managing Partner at Team8 Capital. &#8220;As the quantum era takes off, they have managed to solve the missing piece in the quantum computing puzzle, which will enable game-changing quantum algorithms. We look forward to seeing the industry grow, and witnessing how <span class="il">Classiq</span> continues to mark its place as a leader in the industry.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has spelled economic setbacks for many people and industries, but the capital swirling about the technology world continues to roar along. In the latest development, <a href="http://tcv.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCV</a> &#8212; the storied venture capital firm behind the likes of Airbnb, Spotify, Peloton and Facebook &#8212; has closed a record $4 billion for its latest fund.</p>
<p>This is not only the company&#8217;s biggest fund to date, but it also speaks to just how fast the tech industry is accelerating in terms of capital and how much of it tech is attracting. In 25 years of operations (a milestone it passed in 2020) TCV invested $14 billion across hundreds of startups. This latest $4 billion fund raised in a matter of months represents nearly 30% of that figure.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s also more than the company originally targeted, which was <a href="https://www.buyoutsinsider.com/veteran-tech-investor-tcv-targets-3-25bn-for-fund-xi-amid-ideal-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.25 billion</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Parter John Doran told TechCrunch the plan will be to use the money to continue backing existing portfolio companies, as well as make new bets, both in areas that have shown to be very strong winners in the last year &#8212; e-commerce, education, and tools to enable working in the cloud, for example &#8212; but also investments in areas that may not be doing as well right now, but TCV will believes will return, like travel.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We have to take a long term view,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s about great founders and CEOs, and where those in areas like travel, you&#8217;ll still see the startups get funded at up rounds. Besides, who will be better positioned to grow and take advantage of a world that’s now more digital? That is a huge opportunity in the long term.&#8221;</p>
<p>As with other big capital events, the closing of a VC fund may not be intrinsically interesting news in itself, but it&#8217;s a significant bellwether that points to the level of confidence, interest and activity in the early stages of the funding process. That, in turn, has a direct knock-on effect for startups, and subsequently the technology industry at large.</p>
<p>In the case of TCV XI, as it is known, it&#8217;s a sign of strength in the market &#8212; it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/tcv-closes-3b-fund-aimed-at-consumer-internet-it-infrastructure-and-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 billion more than its previous fund, closed before the pandemic in 2019</a> &#8212; but also an endorsement of some of the less traditional processes and practices that have become the norm in many of our lives.</p>
<p>Notably, the raising (and closing) of the fund was done entirely virtually over the last year, Julia Roux, the company&#8217;s head of investor relations, told TechCrunch, from a mix of returning and new LPs. Going virtual is also, in many cases, the route that TCV (and other VCs) have taken in closing deals over the last year too, which looks like it may now be here to stay.</p>
<p>TCV has been very active in the past year, not just with private startup investments but seeing one of its most successful startups go public. Airbnb boldly went for an IPO in December, in the wake of a year that saw its business providing accommodation and other services to travellers come to a grinding halt.</p>
<p>The IPO was an example of the kind of more long-term investing that the firm is keen on doing (and very much has the funds to do now) despite current market conditions. Doran pointed out that TCV remains a &#8220;big believers in the Airbnb story,&#8221; investing in more shares in the company in the IPO.</p>
<p class="p1">Other big investments this year have included a lot of activity in commerce and fintech &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/dutch-payments-startup-mollie-raises-106m-at-1b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mollie</a> (raised $106 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/spryker-raises-130m-at-a-500m-valuation-to-provide-b2bs-with-agile-e-commerce-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spryker</a> ($130 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/revolut-raises-500-million-at-5-5-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revolut</a> ($500 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/klarna-raises-650-million-at-a-10-6-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Klarna</a> ($650 million), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/fintech-decacorn-nubank-raises-400m-led-by-tcv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nubank</a> ($400 million) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mambu</a> ($135 million) &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/strava-raises-110-million-touts-growth-rate-of-2-million-new-users-per-month-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strava</a> ($110 million). (Note how many of those rounds were outside the U.S.: almost all of them. The company says it has some $4 billion under management outside the U.S. now.)</p>
<p>Recent exits include AxiomSL, Genesys, Cradlepoint, and Silver Peak.</p>
<p>“We are humbled by the ongoing support of new and returning investors, which enabled us to raise a record sized fund,” said Jay Hoag, a founding general partner at TCV, in a statement. “Just as importantly, we are honored by all the great entrepreneurs we’ve worked with over the past 25 years, as their vision and relentless execution has been our foundation. We look forward to backing entrepreneurs with our new fund that we believe will become the next generation of iconic companies, in this incredibly fertile technology industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s not every day you see a Latin American startup funded by a U.S. venture capital firm based in the midwest. <a href="http://playvox.com">Playvox</a>, a Colombian startup that wants to bring a positive twist to customer service monitoring announced a $25 million investment from <a href="https://www.fiveelms.com/">Five Elms Capital</a>, a Kansas City, MO VC firm. It has now raised $34 million.</p>
<p>While it was at it, Playvox also announced something else unusual for an early stage company: an acquisition. The startup bought an Australian company called<a href="https://agyletime.com/"> Agyle Time</a>, a workforce monitoring SaaS tool. The acquisition brings together two companies with similar missions to provide a more complete customer service solution.</p>
<p>Playvox founder and CEO Oscar Giraldo founded the company in 2012 and has been quietly building it into an international business with brand name customers like Dropbox, Electronic Arts and Wish. The company&#8217;s Workforce Optimization platform works as a layer on top of customer service center management tools like Zendesk and Salesforce Service Cloud, allowing management to monitor digital channels and give customer service agents feedback to help them do their jobs better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When you call a contact center or a company, you may hear that &#8216;this call may be recorded for quality and training purposes&#8217;. So Playvox is a technology that works on the backend of [the customer service system] to manage the workforce that is responsible for providing a great customer experience,&#8221; Giraldo explained. It does this, but instead of for calls, it focuses on chat and email interactions.</p>
<p>Giraldo got the idea for the business nine years ago when he was working as a software engineer in Argentina and toured some customer service centers, where he observed a lot of disgruntled and unhappy employees. He wanted to start a company that would help give feedback to these employees in a more constructive and positive way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of the traditional approach of customer service QA that was punishing the agents [for mistakes], what we do is we use that data to train them with a learning management system that is integrated in the platform, and have coaching tools that allow our customers to provide timely feedback to the agent so they can change their behavior for the better,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The Agyle Time acquisition enables the company to expand beyond this feedback system into customer service workforce scheduling and position them to compete in the enterprise market with a more complete toolset. &#8220;What we see is that combining the quality management agent optimization tools that Playvox has built with Agyle Time&#8217;s workforce management will allow us to be a unique vendor in the marketplace,&#8221; Giraldo said.</p>
<p>As for Five Elms, it&#8217;s a firm that invests between $4 and $40 million in companies that have between $2 and $20 million in revenue. They like SaaS companies in atypical places with portfolio companies in Fayetteville, AK, Columbus, OH and Brisbane Australia. Playvox fits nicely in that group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Playvox continues to deliver extraordinary products, add renowned brands to its customer base, and attract exceptional executives because of its company values and culture,&#8221; Ryan Mandl, managing director at Five Elms Capital said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.datastax.com/">Datastax</a>, the company best known for commercializing the open-source <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/">Apache Cassandra database</a>, is moving beyond databases. As the company announced today, it has acquired <a href="https://kesque.com/">Kesque</a>, a cloud messaging service.</p>
<p>The Kesque team built its service on top of the Apache Pulsar messaging and streaming project. Datastax has now taken that team&#8217;s knowledge in this area and, combined with its own expertise, is launching its own Pulsar-based streaming platform by the name of <a href="https://www.datastax.com/products/luna-streaming">Datastax Luna Streaming</a>, which is now generally available.</p>
<p>This move comes right as Datastax is also now, for the first time, announcing that it is cash-flow positive and profitable, as the company&#8217;s chief product officer, Ed Anuff, told me. &#8220;We are at over $150 million in [annual recurring revenue]. We are cash-flow positive and we are profitable,&#8221; he told me. This marks the first time the company is publically announcing this data. In addition, the company also today revealed that about 20 percent of its annual contract value is now for DataStax Astra, its managed multi-cloud Cassandra service and that the number of self-service Asta subscribers has more than doubled from Q3 to Q4.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The launch of Luna Streaming now gives the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/datastax">10-year-old company</a> a new area to expand into &#8212; and one that has some obvious adjacencies with its existing product portfolio.</p>
<p>&#8220;We looked at how a lot of developers are building on top of Cassandra,&#8221; Anuff, who joined Datastax after leaving Google Cloud last year, said. &#8220;What they&#8217;re doing is, they&#8217;re addressing what people call &#8216;data-in-motion&#8217; use cases. They have huge amounts of data that are coming in, huge amounts of data that are going out &#8212; and they&#8217;re typically looking at doing something with streaming in conjunction with that. As we&#8217;ve gone in and asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s next for Datastax?,&#8217; streaming is going to be a big part of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given Datastax&#8217;s open-source roots, it&#8217;s no surprise the team decided to build its service on another open-source project and acquire an open-source company to help it do so. Anuff noted that while there has been a lot of hype around streaming and Apache Kafka, a cloud-native solution like Pulsar seemed like the better solution for the company. Pulsar was originally developed at Yahoo! (which, full disclosure, belongs to the same Verizon Media Group family as TechCrunch) and even before acquiring Kesque, Datastax already used Pulsar to build its Astra platform. Other Pulsar users include Yahoo, Tencent, Nutanix and Splunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we saw was that when you go and look at doing streaming in a scale-out way, that Kafka isn&#8217;t the only approach. We looked at it, and we liked the Pulsar architecture, we like what&#8217;s going on, we like the community &#8212; and remember, we&#8217;re a company that grew up in the Apache open-source community &#8212; we said, &#8216;okay, we think that it&#8217;s got all the right underpinnings, let&#8217;s go and get involved in that,&#8221; Anuff said. And in the process of doing so, the team came across Kesque founder Chris Bartholomew and eventually decided to acquire his company.</p>
<p>The new Luna Streaming offering will be what Datastax calls a &#8220;subscription to success with Apache Pulsar.&#8217; It will include a free, production-ready distribution of Pulsar and an optional, SLA-backed subscription tier with enterprise support.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Datastax also plans to remain active in the Pulsar community. The team is already making code contributions, but Anuff also stressed that Datastax is helping out with scalability testing. &#8220;This is one of the things that we learned in our participation in the Apache Cassandra project,&#8221; Anuff said. &#8220;A lot of what these projects need is folks coming in doing testing, helping with deployments, supporting users. Our goal is to be a great participant in the community.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After revealing its first fund just last year, a $100 million pool of investment capital dedicated to early stage startups focusing on sustainable food development, clean energy, health innovation and new space technologies, <a href="https://www.primemoverslab.com">Prime Movers Lab</a> is back with a second fund. Prime Movers Lab Fund II is larger, with $245 million committed, but it will pursue the same investment strategy, albeit with a plan to place more bets on more companies, with an expanded investment team to help manage the funds and portfolio.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of VCs out there,&#8221; explained founder and general partner Dakin Sloss about the concept behind the fund. &#8220;But there aren&#8217;t many VCs that are focused exclusively on breakthrough science, or deep tech. Even though there are a couple, when you look at the proportion of capital, I think it&#8217;s something like less than 10% of capital is going to these types of companies. But if you look at what&#8217;s meaningful to the life of the average person over the next 30 years, these are all the companies that are important, whether it&#8217;s coronavirus vaccine,s or solar energy production, or feeding the planet through aquaponics. These are the things that are really meaningful to to making a better quality of life for most people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sloss told me that he sees part of the issue around why the proportion of capital dedicated to solving these significant problems is that it requires a lot of deep category knowledge to invest in correctly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not enough technical expertise in VC firms to choose winners intelligently, rather than ending up with the next Theranos or clean tech bubble,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So that&#8217;s the first thing I wanted to solve. I have a physics background, and I was able to bring together a team of partners that have really deeply technical backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>As referenced, Sloss himself has a degree from Stanford in Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy. He was a serial entrepreneur before starting the fund, having founded Tachyus, OpenGov and nonprofit California Common Sense. Other Partners on the team include systems engineer Dan Slomski, who previously worked on machine vision, electro-mechanical systems and developing a new multi-phase flow fluid analyzer; Amy Kruse, who holds a PhD in neuroscience and has served as an executive in defence technology and applied neuroscience companies; and Carly Anderson, a chemical engineer who has worked in biomedicine and oil &amp; gas, and who has a PhD in chemical and biomolecular engineering. In addition to core partners with that kind of expertise, Prime Movers Lab enlists the help of venture partners and specialist advisors like former astronaut Chris Hadfield.</p>
<p>Having individuals with deep field expertise on the core team, in addition to supplementing that with top-notch advisors, is definitely a competitive advantage, particularly when investing in the kinds of companies that Prime Movers Lab does early on in their development. There&#8217;s a perception that companies pursuing these kinds of hard tech problems aren&#8217;t necessarily as viable as a target for traditional venture funding, specifically because of the timelines for returns. Sloss says he believes that&#8217;s a misperception based on unfortunate past experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there are three big myths about breakthrough science or hard tech or deep tech,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That it takes longer, that it&#8217;s more capital intensive, and that it&#8217;s higher risk. And I think the reason those myths are out there is people invested in things like Theranos, and the clean tech bubble. But I think that there were fundamental mistakes made in how they underwrote risk of doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1816563" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1816563" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1816563" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="752" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=768,564 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=680,500 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/momentus-vigoride-extended.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1816563" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Momentus</p></div></p>
<p>To avoid making those kinds of mistakes, Sloss says that Prime Movers Lab views prospective investments from the perspective of a &#8220;spectrum of risk,&#8221; which includes risk of the science itself (does the fundamental technology involve actually work), engineering risk (given the science works, can we make it something we can sell) and finally, commercialization or scaling risk (can we then make it and sell it at scale with economics that work). Sloss says that if you use this risk matrix to assess investments, and allocated funds to address primarily the engineering risk category, concerns around timeframes to return don&#8217;t really apply.</p>
<p>He cites Primer Movers Lab&#8217;s Fund I portfolio, which includes space propulsion company Momentus, heading for an exit to the public markets via SPAC (the company&#8217;s Russian CEO actually just <a href="https://spacenews.com/momentus-ceo-resigns-amid-u-s-government-concerns/">resigned in order to smooth the path for that, in fact</a>), and notes that of the 15 companies that Fund I invested in, four are totally on a path to going public. That would put them much faster to an exit than is typical for early stage investment targets, and Sloss credits the very different approach most hard science startups take to IP development and capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;The inflection points in these types of companies are actually I think faster to get to market, because they&#8217;ve spent years developing the IP, staying at relatively low or attractive valuations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then we can kind of come in, at that inflection point, and help them get ready to commercialize and scale up exponentially, to where other investors no longer have to underwrite the difference between science and engineering risk, they can just see it&#8217;s working and producing revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies that fit this mold often come directly from academia, and keep the team small and focused while they&#8217;re figuring out the core scientific discovery or innovation that enables the business. A prime example of this in recent memory <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/wingcopter-raises-22-million-to-expand-to-the-u-s-and-launch-a-next-generation-drone/">is Wingcopter</a>, a German drone startup that developed and patented a technology for a tilt-wing rotor that changes the economics of electric autonomous drone flight. The startup just took its first significant startup investment after bootstrapping for four years, and the funds will indeed be used to help it accelerate engineering on a path towards high-volume production.</p>
<p>While Wingcopter isn&#8217;t a Prime Movers Lab portfolio company, many of its investments fit the same mold. Boom Aerospace is currently working on building and flying its subscale demonstration aircraft to pave the way for a future supersonic airliner, while Axiom Space just announced the first crew of private tourists to the International Space Station who will fly on a SpaceX Falcon 9 for $50 million a piece. As long as you can prove the fundamentals are sound, allocating money turning it into something marketable seems like a logical strategy.</p>
<p>For Prime Movers Lab&#8217;s Fund II, the plan is to invest in around 30 or so companies, roughly doubling the number of investments from Fund I. In addition to its partners with scientific expertise, the firm also includes Partners with skill sets including creative direction, industrial design, executive coaching and business acumen, and provides those services to its portfolio companies as value-add to help them supplement their technical innovations. Its Fund I portfolio includes Momentus and Axiom, as mentioned, as well as vertical farming startup Upward Farms, coronavirus vaccine startup Covaxx, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People and businesses are relying on the internet to get things done more than ever before, an opportunity but also an infrastructure headache for service providers that need to scale quickly and reliably to meet that demand.</p>
<p>Today, a startup that has built a clever, software-based way for them to expand their networks without buying costly equipment is announcing a major round of funding on the back of its business booming.</p>
<p><a href="http://drivenets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DriveNets</a> &#8212; which provides software-based routing solutions to service providers that run them as virtualized services over &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_box_(computer_hardware)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">white box</a>&#8221; generic architecture &#8212; has closed $208 million in funding, a Series B that values the company at over $1 billion post-money.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The plan will be to use the funding to continue building out the business internationally and to tailor it to more use cases beyond carriers, including the wave of bigger companies that stream large amounts of media and have some control over their networks as a result.</p>
<p>Future deals are still under NDA, CEO Ido Susan said, but he described the opportunity as a clear one: &#8220;If you want to serve bandwidth with low latency, if you want to offer strong 5G capability or cloud gaming, you need to be close to your end customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series B is being D1 Capital Partners. Previous backers Bessemer Venture Partners and Pitango (which co-led DriveNets&#8217; previous, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/drivenets-emerges-from-stealth-with-110m-for-its-cloud-based-alternative-to-network-routers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$110 million round</a> when it emerged from stealth) also made a significant investment, and Atreides Management also participated. This latest round was made at more than double DriveNets&#8217; valuation in 2019.</p>
<p>D1 has been an especially prolific investor in the last year, going big on businesses that are seeing a lot of attention as a result of pandemic conditions. They include e-commerce giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/warby-parker-valued-at-3-billion-raises-245-million-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warby Parker</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/instacart-raises-200m-more-at-17-7b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instacart</a>, fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/transferwise-five-unicorns/">TransferWise</a>, gaming engine <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/unity-now-valued-at-6b-raising-up-to-525m/">Unity</a>, online car sales platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cazoo-the-uk-used-car-sales-portal-raises-another-311m-now-valued-at-over-2b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cazoo</a>, and transportation startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bolt-raises-182m-to-expand-its-on-demand-transportation-network-in-europe-and-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bolt</a>.</p>
<p>DriveNets&#8217; big round is based both on bigger trends in the market, as well as its own strong record.</p>
<p>Before this round, DriveNets had already <a href="https://drivenets.com/news-and-events/press-release/att-deploys-drivenets-network-cloud-in-their-next-gen-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">counted AT&amp;T among its customers</a>, a major vote of confidence for the company and its virtual network approach, but it seems that recent circumstances and the spike in internet activity have brought more providers to consider its approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;The internet was growing 30%-40% annually even before Covid-19,&#8221; said Susan. &#8220;But even five years ago, incumbent carriers were coming to us saying, said no one can build virtual networks. Now, it’s not a question of whether it works or not, but when you will adopt it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recent m<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">omentum for the company&#8217;s sales, he said, is very good. &#8220;Everyone is working and studying from home so you need more capacity and bandwidth in the network,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p>DriveNets&#8217; core product is a more flexible and cost-effective replacement for the traditional network router that relies on virtualized architecture. Traditionally, routers have been sold as vertically-integrated hardware solutions, bringing together both software and hardware into one branded big box, with companies like Cisco and Juniper Networks dominating the space.</p>
<p>In their place, as Susan and co-founder Hillel Kobrinsky envisioned it, DriveNets provides a solution that is based around generic white boxes. It currently works with three providers for these boxes, Susan said.</p>
<p>These work in conjunction with a system it has developed called Network Cloud, which in turn runs a networking stack called the DriveNets Operating System. Service providers control their systems of white boxes and other servers through a virtualized service run over Docker containers, using open APIs to automate and configure various network services.</p>
<p>This allows for more flexibility in capacity among the white box servers, but they can also be easily added and removed as needed. Essentially, it&#8217;s a system that disaggregates the software from the hardware, to make expanding the hardware much easier, and controlling the software significantly more flexible to boot.</p>
<p>(Ironically, my conversation with Susan took place over Zoom with him in his home office, which also doubles as a DIY workshop. So with a full array of hardware equipment surrounding Susan, we talked about how software would come to dominate the world.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a disruptive concept that potentially steps on a lot of toes, but Adam Fisher, a partner with Bessemer, said that he&#8217;s confident it&#8217;s one that will continue to gain traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are extremely enthusiastic about the company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Aside from Ido and Hillel as entrepreneurs, we really connected with their vision. Network routing is moving to software and cloud architecture. We&#8217;re talking not just about the small parts here but the hearts and lungs of the system. DriveNets is starting with the hardest parts. Once one customer becomes multiple customers, you just realise it&#8217;s the future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beauty and wellness appointment booking apps have proliferated of the last few years, but it appears the race is still on as today one of the leaders, <a href="https://booksy.com">Booksy</a>, raises $70 million in a Series C round led by Cat Rock Capital, with participation from Sprints Capital. </p>
<p>The round was also joined by OpenOcean, Piton Capital, VNV Global, Enern, Kai Hansen, Zach Coelius and Manta Ray Ventures, and takes the total raised by the firm to $119 million. The funding will be used for expansion plans across North America, expanding to new verticals, and acquiring complementary businesses.</p>
<p>The Booksy app is used by customers to book and pay for beauty appointments with local businesses. Salons, nail bars and barbershops can manage the bookings, payments, and customer base via the accompanying Booksy Biz app. The platform also allows salons to sell other products via Booksy E-Commerce, which acts as a marketplace allowing customers to discover and book other local stylists, nail technicians etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Booksy was founded by Polish entrepreneurs Stefan Batory (CEO) and Konrad Howard. Allowing customers to schedule their best appointment time means that 38% of customers end up booking after-hours and increasing their appointment frequency by 20%, says the company. The startup launched in 2014 but is now in the US (its largest market), UK, Poland, Spain, Brazil, and South Africa. It claims to be the number-one beauty booking app in each country, with “13 million” consumers on the app.</p>
<p>Batory said in a statement: “Like with many sectors negatively hit by the pandemic, it’s been a turbulent time for the beauty and wellness industry but we’re confident in its ability to come back from this, so it’s fantastic to see our latest group of investors share our optimism and vision. This latest round of funding enables us to reach even more salons and service providers across the US, and in all the regions we operate, which in turn helps them reach more customers.” </p>
<p>Alex Captain, founder and managing partner at Cat Rock Capital, said: “We are incredibly excited to invest in Booksy as it builds the leading global software platform for digitizing the beauty and wellness industry around the world.”</p>
<p>Booksy certainly seems to have cracked the international expansion game ahead of most competitors, which tend to stay more local to their countries of origin such as Treatwell, Styleseat, Vagaro and Mindbody. The opportunity for Booksy is to now use its war cast to roll-up other local players.</p>
<p>It has already acquired rival Lavito in 2018 and, more recently, merged with Versum in December 2020 allowing it to enter Mexico.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lime is adding electric mopeds — painted in the company&#8217;s signature green — to its micromobility platform as the startup aims to own the spectrum of inner city travel from jaunts to the corner store to longer distance trips up to five miles.</p>
<p>Lime said Wednesday it plans to launch as many as 600 electric mopeds on its platform this spring in Washington D.C. The company is also working with officials to pilot the mopeds in Paris. Eventually, the mopeds will be offered in a &#8220;handful of cities&#8221; over the next several months.</p>
<p>The mopeds, supplied by manufacturer Niu, are designed for two people and outfitted with tech like infrared-cameras in the helmet compartment that can detect if they&#8217;re in use during a trip, an effort aimed at rooting out misuse and increasing safety. Repeat offenders of Lime&#8217;s policies, which includes wearing a helmet at all times, will be kicked off the platform. Customers will also be required to take a selfie wearing the helmet at the start of a ride.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The helmets will be supplied by Moon for U.S. customers and Nikko for the European deployments.</p>
<p>The mopeds will have a top speed of 28 miles an hour and be able to travel up to 87 miles on a single charge. Unlike Lime scooters, in which gig economy workers can earn money by collecting, charging and bringing back to city streets, the mopeds will have swappable batteries and be maintained by full-time employees.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s unclear if mopeds have always been part of Lime&#8217;s long-term plans, the company&#8217;s head of new mobility  told TechCrunch that they&#8217;ve been thinking about what the future of electrified urban transportation might include.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;As we&#8217;ve grown as a company, we understood that we just needed to follow what our riders were demanding which is further distances,&#8221; said Sean Arroyo, head of new mobility at Lime. &#8220;The ability to meet any trip, at anytime, anywhere, is something that&#8217;s at the foundation for us and so our riders really are the ones that pointed us in this direction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Lime CEO Wayne Ting first hinted late last year that a &#8220;third mode&#8221; of transport beyond scooters and bikes was in the works for the first quarter of 2021 as well as the addition of third-party companies to its platform. Last year, Lime also started to include on its app <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wheels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="wheels">Wheels</a>-branded electric bikes in certain cities. Ting said, at the time, that users should expect more partnerships like these.</p>
<p>The expansion into mopeds is the latest sign that Lime has managed to put some of its darker Covid-19-tainted times behind it. Lime <a href="https://www.li.me/second-street/limes-path-through-covid-19">underwent a round of layoffs</a> in April, taking on capital from Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">the next month</a> in a down-round that brought its valuation under the $1 billion mark. Lime paused most of its operations for a month during the early COVID-19 days.</p>
<p>But it has since rebounded. Ting said in November that the company is both operating cash flow positive and free cash flow positive in the third quarter and was on pace to be full-year profitable, excluding certain costs (EBIT), in 2021. It also had enough cash — or access to it — to expand into mopeds.</p>
<p>The question is, &#8216;whether more modes are on the way?&#8217;</p>
<p>Arroyo didn&#8217;t give specifics, but it does appear more is coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think throughout this year you&#8217;re gonna see us really expand, not just with modes, but optionality,&#8221; Arroyo said. &#8221; For us it&#8217;s really about having a platform that&#8217;s available for all these trips, and then we want to be able to provide optionality that makes sense for the riders. Shared is a huge component, but there&#8217;s a lot of different levels of what shared looks like; and throughout 2021, I think you&#8217;re gonna see us offer quite a few different options as our modes expand.&#8221;</p>
