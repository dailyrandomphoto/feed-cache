										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has led to people everywhere shopping more online and Latin America is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based Nuvemshop has developed an e-commerce platform that aims to allow SMBs and merchants to connect more directly with their consumers. With more people in Latin America getting used to making purchases digitally, the company has experienced a major surge in business over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for Nuvemshop&#8217;s offering was already heating up prior to the pandemic. But over the past 12 months, that demand has skyrocketed as more merchants have been seeking greater control over their brands. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than selling their goods on existing marketplaces (such as Mercado Libre, the Brazilian equivalent of Amazon), many merchants and entrepreneurs are opting to start and grow their own online businesses, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop co-founder and CEO Santiago Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most merchants have entered the internet by selling on marketplaces but we are hearing from newer generations of merchants and SMBs that they don’t want to be intermediated anymore,” he said. “They want to connect more directly with consumers and convey their own brand, image and voice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proof is in the numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop has seen the number of merchants on its platform surge to nearly 80,000 across Brazil, Argentina and Mexico compared to 20,000 at the start of 2020. These businesses range from direct-to-consumer (DTC) upstarts to larger brands such as PlayMobil, Billabong and Luigi Bosca. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtually every KPI tripled in the company in 2020 as the world saw a massive transition to online, and Nuvemshop’s platform was home to 14 million transactions last year, according to Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With us, businesses can find a more comprehensive ecosystem around payments, logistics, shipping and catalogue/inventory management,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop&#8217;s rapid growth caught the attention of Silicon Valley-based Accel. Having just </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/nuvemshop-a-latin-american-answer-to-shopify-raises-30-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $30 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series C round in October and achieving profitability in 2020, the Nuvemshop team was not looking for more capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ethan Choi, a partner at Accel, said his firm saw in Nuvemshop the potential to be the market leader, or the “de facto” e-commerce platform, in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accel has been investing in e-commerce for a very long time. It’s a very important area for us,” Choi said. “We saw what they were building and all their potential. So we pre-emptively asked them to let us invest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Nuvemshop is announcing that it has closed on a $90 million Series D funding led by Accel. ThornTree Capital and returning backers Kaszek, Qualcomm Ventures and others also put money in the round, which brings Nuvemshop’s total funding raised since its 2011 inception to nearly $130 million. The company declined to reveal at what valuation this latest round was raised but it is notable that its Series D is triple the size of its Series C, raised just over six months prior. Sosa said only that there was a “substantial increase” in valuation since its Series C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop is banking on the fact that the density of SMBs in Latin America is higher in most Latin American countries compared to the U.S. On top of that, the $85 billion e-commerce market in Latin America is growing rapidly with projections of it </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching $116.2 billion in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Brazil, it grew 40% last year but is still underpenetrated, representing less than 10% of retail sales. In Latin America as a whole, penetration is somewhere between 5 and 10%,” Sosa said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127927" style="width: 575px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127927" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2127927" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="565" height="376" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Santiago-Sosa-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127927" class="wp-caption-text">Nuvemshop co-founder and CEO Santiago Sosa;<br />Image courtesy of Nuvemshop</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company transitioned from a closed product to a platform that is open to everyone from third parties, developers, agencies and other SaaS vendors. Through Nuvemshop’s APIs, all those third parties can connect their apps into Nuvemshop’s platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform becomes much more powerful, vendors are generating more revenue and merchants have more options,” Sosa told TechCrunch. “So everyone wins.” Currently, Nuvemshop has about 150 applications publishing on its ecosystem, which he projects will more than triple over the next 12 to 18 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for comparisons to Shopify, Sosa said the company doesn’t necessarily make them but believes they are “fair.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Choi, there are many similarities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw Amazon get to really big scale in the U.S.. Merchants also found tools to build their own presence. This birthed Shopify, which today is worth $160 billion. Both companies saw their market caps quadruple during the pandemic,” he said. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamics in LatAm&#8230;Our bet here is that this company and business has all the same dynamics and the same really powerful tailwinds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Accel partner Andrew Braccia, Nuvemshop has a clear first mover advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past decade, direct-to-consumer has become one of the most important drivers of entrepreneurship globally,” he said. “Latin America is no exception to this trend, and we believe that Nuvemshop h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the level of sophistication and ability to understand all that change and fuel the continued transformation of commerce from offline to online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Sosa expects Nuvemshop will use its new capital to significantly invest in: continuing to open its APIs; payments processing and financial services; “everything related to logistics and logistics management” and attracting smaller merchants. It also plans to expand into other markets such as Colombia, Chile and Peru over the next 18-24 months. Nuvemshop currently operates in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the countries share the same secular trends and product experience, they have very different market dynamics,” Sosa said. “This requires an on the ground local knowledge to make it all work. Separate markets require distinct knowledge. That makes this a more complicated opportunity, but one that enables a long-term competitive advantage.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zaver.io/">Zaver</a>, a Swedish fintech that enable merchants to accept cardless payments and offer buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) as an option, has raised $5 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The company, which began life focused on P2P payments for marketplace transactions, is now doubling down on the durables sector (think: automotive, health &amp; beauty, craftmanship etc.) for both online and offline commerce, after claiming to have found product-market-fit.</p>
<p>Backing Zaver&#8217;s new round are VCs Inbox Capital (the firm that has invested in the likes of Revolut and Klarna), and Inventure. Other investors include Fredrik Österberg (founder of Evolution Gaming), Magnus Rausing (angel investor), Joen Bonnier (partner at Atomico), and Fabian Hielte, Max Hobohm and Johannes Hobohm, (owners of Ernstrom).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Amir Marandi and Linus Malmén in mid 2016, while both were students at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Zaver wants to accelerate the move away from plastic cards, to mobile payments. Its target market is &#8220;durables,&#8221; starting in Sweden. Payments functionality and features include online and offline cardless payments powered by open banking, instant payouts for merchants, BNPL and credit scoring.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="k9OelQAwSs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/zaver/">Swedish fintech Zaver has raised $1.2M seed for its P2P payments platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Swedish fintech Zaver has raised $1.2M seed for its P2P payments platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/zaver/embed/#?secret=k9OelQAwSs" data-secret="k9OelQAwSs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;By durables, we mean goods (and services) that do not need to be purchased often, and typically last for a longer period of time e.g. automotive, a visit to the dentist clinic, or kitchen renovation,&#8221; Marandi tells me. &#8220;[These] are often higher transaction value than &#8216;common&#8217; retail products or services&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since the launch of &#8220;Zaver for Business&#8221; two years ago, Marandi says the company has gone from zero to &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; in processing volume. “Today, we have a product market fit proving that the users are willing to leave old habits, and instead use their phone in order to pay for even larger items or services,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Through bypassing the card rails, Marandi argues that Zaver is able to customize pricing, user experience and product development in-house, in a way that isn&#8217;t possible until now. &#8220;The focus in on replacing legacy-solutions with a comprehensive banking and payments platform for SMEs in this sector, where BNPL plays a key role in the transition in customer behaviour,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zaver&#8217;s main competitors are cited as legacy products, such as credit cards, and factoring companies. &#8220;What makes us different is that we focus on the shift to mobile payments in a sector with low margin sales, and high average transaction values,&#8221; says Marandi. &#8220;By focusing on new customer behaviours (e.g. BNPL, direct debit, instalments at point-of-sale) and real time settlements, we can offer the same frictionless payment experience online and offline, no matter the size of the tickets&#8221;.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional remittance companies, while necessary, currently have two flaws in speed and exorbitant fees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It can take a long while (days to weeks) for money sent from an immigrant in the U.S. to reach a relative in Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fees charged depend on the amount sent &#8212; and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">let&#8217;s not forget the extra charges for withdrawals and deposits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ben-eluan">Ben Eluan</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/osezele-orukpe-1a37a9167">Osezele Orukpe</a>, two software engineers based in Nigeria, faced this problem in 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They had executed a project for a client in the U.K. and when the time came for them to get paid, they settled with Skrill. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it took a week for the friends to get their money, and they lost a considerable chunk of it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to charges</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The experience made us think of the payments and, more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cross border payments,&#8221; Eluan said to TechCrunch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gig economy and the service economy for small businesses economy is very massive, and we care about it enough to dedicate all our time into building payments for Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last three years, crypto remittance companies have emerged to fill in this need, as well. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via an application and from a wallet, people can convert fiat into crypto and send it to the wallets of people in other countries who convert back to fiat if they choose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127947" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127947" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2127947" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="414" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png 1775w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=768,467 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=1536,935 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mockup-TC.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2127947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flux</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the same proposition Eluan (CEO), Orukpe (CTO) and the team have with their product, <a href="https://iflux.app/">Flux</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto remittance company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enable merchants to send and receive money from anywhere in the world, Eluan tells me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that what differentiates Flux from other crypto remittance startups lies in the ease and speed of the platform&#8217;s transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He claims that facilitating payments on Flux is 100x faster than fiat, and is cheaper too. The platform charges $0.50 for every transaction, regardless of the amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2020, Flux got <a href="https://pioneer.app/blog/meet-the-pioneers-may-2020/">accepted into Pioneer</a>, an accelerator launched by ex-YC partner Daniel Gross</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pioneer gives founders access to funding streams and talent hardly found outside Silicon Valley</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has already backed more than 100 founders who give up 1% equity to join the accelerator. Depending on their progress, Pioneer can decide to give either $20,000 for 5%, $100,000 for 5%, or $1 million for 10%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the program, Flux </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $77,000 pre-seed investment from different investors &#8212; Hustle Fund and Mozilla, among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eluan says the six-month-old company has 5,000 customers who have transacted over $750,000 in payments volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the CEO, the startup is growing 40% month-on-month and has made $25,000 in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company witnessed this growth despite the Central Bank of Nigeria&#8217;s clampdown on crypto exchange activities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The country&#8217;s apex bank <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2021/CCD/CBN%20Press%20Release%20Crypto%2007022021.pdf">ordered local banks</a> to stop aiding crypto transactions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This meant that crypto users on Flux and other crypto platforms could no longer convert fiat to crypto using their bank accounts or cards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had to be compliant because of the CBN policy and our customers can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> convert their crypto to fiat but can still transact their crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is why we want to make Flux available in the US and UK, where people can use Flux and send money to Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s currently not available but that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re building and is the next phase of our application,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is also working on a peer-to-peer feature that will see users </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transact crypto and fiat with one another</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has launched Flux Merchants, a product that allows merchants to accept payments by creating payment links for their products and services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eluan, Orukpe, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/israel-akintunde">Israel Akintunde</a> (VP, Engineering) and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ayomide-lasaki-1208b6172">Ayomide Lasaki</a> (head of Marketing) &#8212; met in their freshman year at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) in Ile-Ife, Osun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studying various engineering disciplines, the four friends formed a &#8220;programming club&#8221; with other software developers on campus where they would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meet to write code and make applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Eluan even tells me they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> skipped class for these sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Flux, the friends built an e-commerce platform called Joppa that helped people find merchants around them within the city</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they had 20,000 users, Eluan says the team didn&#8217;t understand the dynamics of what it entailed to run a startup, so the business had to shut down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A factor that eventually led to founding Flux was the university&#8217;s budding tech talent ecosystem, which is teeming with stories of prominent startups launched by alumni. Some include J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obberman, Africa&#8217;s largest recruitment site; Kudi and Cowrywise, two YC-backed companies; and Techstars company Farmcrowdy among others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These founders came from our school and it was a huge motivation for us. We always knew that we wanted to build something but we weren&#8217;t sure what this would be. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> landed on Joppa, then Flux,&#8221; Eluan added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, according to <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/10/29/oau-cu-mwas/">Techpoint Africa</a>, OAU alumni have founded startups that have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cumulatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $1 million more than other alumni from other universities in West Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Think of OAU as the region&#8217;s Stanford University.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unlike others, the founders dropped out of the university to start Flux. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We dropped out to focus on our startup and scaling it into a $1 billion company. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the opportunity here is huge. So for us, the right thing to do is to get the job done well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Startups need time so dropping out was inevitable,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are they the first set of African founders that are all dropouts to get into Y Combinator, but they&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the youngest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a feat Flux </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is thrilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about, and Eluan believes it will open the doors for more young founders on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about that, and it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means brilliant young people in Nigeria and Africa can definitely go ahead to build stuff and get funded too </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like founders from the U.S.,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while their acceptance into Y Combinator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a much-needed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> validation for their work and sacrifice, there&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, now based in Lagos, is playing in a competitive payments space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different companies like Chipper Cash, Flutterwave, MFS Africa and other crypto startups are trying to fix cross-border payments, and there&#8217;s a race against time to capture market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, YC, Pioneer, other backers, and the team&#8217;s understanding of the market will propel Flux to dominance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Caesar Sengupta, the long-time head of Google’s Next Billion Users initiative, is leaving the company next month, he said Monday. Sengupta, who additionally also led the company&#8217;s payments business in the past three years, is leaving the firm after nearly 15 years.</p>
<p>A regular fixture at Google’s events in India, Brazil, and Indonesia, Sengupta (pictured above) is best known outside the company for leading the company’s Next Billion Users unit, an initiative to make internet and services more accessible to users in developing markets.</p>
<p>As part of Next Billion Users initiative, Google brought internet connectivity to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/google-says-over-8-million-people-use-its-free-wifi-service-at-railway-stations-in-india/">hundreds of railway stations</a> and other public places in India and other markets (then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">shut down Station</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/17/google-debuts-tez-a-mobile-wallet-and-payments-app-for-india/">launched Google Pay in India</a> (which unlike Google Pay in the U.S., wasn&#8217;t developed atop credit cards) and built several products such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/android-go-is-a-lightweight-version-of-android-for-crazy-cheap-phones/">Android Go</a>, Datally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/google-launches-kormo-app-in-india-to-help-people-find-entry-level-jobs/">Kormo Jobs</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/after-leak-googles-new-file-manager-for-android-files-go-launches-into-public-beta/">Files</a> apps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to Next Billion Users unit, Sengupta served as VP and Product Lead at ChromeOS, the company&#8217;s desktop operating system that powers Chromebooks.</p>
<p>&#8220;After 15 years with Google, Caesar Sengupta has made a personal decision to leave the company and start something entrepreneurial outside of Google. Through his time at Google, Caesar has played a key role in starting, building and leading initiatives such as ChromeOS, Next Billion Users and Google Pay. We are excited to see what he builds next and wish him the best in his new journey,” said a Google spokesperson in a statement. Sengupta&#8217;s current position at the firm is VP and GM of Next Billion Users and Payments.</p>

<p>“To the many, many Googlers working in Africa, APAC, LATAM and MENA, it has been inspiring to hear your voices take more weight in the products Google builds. I know there is so much more work to do,” Sengupta wrote in an email to his colleagues, which he also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thank-you-google-caesar-sengupta/">shared publicly</a>.</p>
<p>“But we are light years ahead of where we were just a short time ago. You’ve helped digitize your economies, made Google feel local and driven Google’s investment into your countries to unprecedented levels,” wrote the Asia-based executive. Sengupta didn&#8217;t share what he plans to do next.</p>
<p>Under Sengupta&#8217;s watch, Google also made several investments in startups in Asia. Some of these investments include Bangalore-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/google-backs-indias-dunzo-in-40-million-funding-round/">delivery startup Dunzo</a>, Android <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">lockscreen developer Glance, and popular news and entertainment app Dailyhunt</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capital firm Spark Capital has decided to ‘sever all ties’ with Dispo, a photo-sharing app co-created by famous YouTuber David Dobrik. The move, announced by the firm late Sunday, was triggered by a<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"> recent investigation by Business Insider</a> that exposed allegations from a woman who said that a member of Dobrik’s Vlog Squad sexually assaulted her.</p>
<p>“In light of recent news about the Vlog Squad and David Dobrik, the cofounder of Dispo, we have made the decision to sever all ties with the company,” Spark Capital tweeted. “We have stepped down from our position on the board and we are in the process of making arrangements to ensure we do not profit from our recent investment in Dispo.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ In light of recent news about the Vlog Squad and David Dobrik, the cofounder of Dispo, we have made the decision to sever all ties with the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Spark Capital (@sparkcapital) <a href="https://twitter.com/sparkcapital/status/1373855197064097794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Hours later, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/29a2fc">Dobrik stepped down from the board of Dispo</a>, as first reported by The Information. Dispo, in a statement to TechCrunch, said the following: &#8220;David has chosen to step down from the board and leave the company to not distract from the company&#8217;s growth. Dispo&#8217;s team, product, and most importantly- our community- stand for building a diverse, inclusive, and empowering world.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The VC angle</h2>
<p>Spark Capital’s decision to step back from the Dispo investment feels like a first of its kind, and if not, rare. It could trigger other investors with stakes in the company to do the same.</p>
<p>Spark Capital<a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-david-dobriks-retro-photo-app-dispo-raises-20-million-0a056861-6ea2-46d2-92af-eda697eb179b.html"> led a Series A in Dispo</a>, a $20 million dollar financing event that valued the company at $200 million, less than one month ago. The current statement by Spark does not indicate that the investment has been pulled from the company.</p>
<p>Spark Capital did not immediately respond to request for comment in regards to what this process would look like, and if the shares will be sold back to the company or to another buyer. While the mechanics of the decision are unclear, the fact that the firm led a deal so recently in the company may have given it some leeway to walk away.</p>
<p>Unshackled Ventures, a firm that backs immigrant founders, was an early investor in Dispo and declined to comment on the record. Seven Seven Six, an early-stage venture capital firm founded by Reddit’s Alexis Ohanian, led the seed round and was unable to be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Other sponsors of Dobrik, including HelloFresh and Dollar Shave Club, have ended their partnerships with the creator.</p>
<p>Update: This story has been updated to reflect Dobrik&#8217;s departure from Diispo.</p>

Pluang is available through partnerships with &#8220;super apps&#8221; like Gojek, Dana and Bukalapak, and currently claims more than one million users.</p>
<p>The company says it is able to maintain a low customer acquisition cost of $2 per transacting customer because it creates its own products, including investment accounts for gold, U.S equity indices and cryptocurrencies, instead of working with third-party financial service providers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Pluang&#8217;s latest round will be used to develop proprietary financial products to cover more asset classes, including government bonds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previously, these assets classes were only available to the wealthy in Indonesia,&#8221; said Pluang founder Claudia Kolonas in a statement. &#8220;However, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to grow their savings, and our new products will reflect that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pluang is among several Indonesian financial apps, including Ajaib, Bibit and FUNDtastic, that have recently raised funding. All focus on making investing accessible to more people by giving them an alternative to traditional brokerage firms that typically charge high fees.</p>

<p>M Capital Management, a Singapore-based venture capital firm, announced today it has closed its debut fund, <a href="https://www.m-venturepartners.com/">M Venture Partners </a>(MVP), totaling $30.85 million USD. It plans to invest in 40 early-stage startups, primarily seed and pre-Series A, with an average initial check size of about $500,000.</p>
<p>M Capital Management was founded by Mayank Parekh, whose investment experience includes launching Grange Partners and leadership positions at Southern Capital Group and McKinsey &amp; Company, and Joachim Ackermann, former managing director of Google Asia Pacific. Other senior team members include Dr. Tanuja Rajah, previously Entrepreneur First’s launch manager, and Chethana Ellepola, former research director at Acquity Stockbrokers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MVP, a sector-agnostic fund, has already invested in 11 companies, including one, 3D Metal Forge, that <a href="https://stockhead.com.au/ipo-watch/ipo-watch-3d-metal-forge-gains-45pc-on-asx-debut/">recently went public on the Australian Securities Exchange</a>.</p>
<p>Other portfolio companies include behavioral health coaching startup Naluri; AI-enabled lending and credit-as-a-service company Impact Credit Solutions; alternative investment fund aggregator XEN Capital; and Cipher Cancer Clinics, which is focused on making oncological care more affordable and accessible in India.</p>
<p>Parekh told TechCrunch that M Capital Management was launched because &#8220;we believe that the early-stage investing space in our region has substantial room for growth. A decade ago there were very few unicorns. This has changed substantially more recently, not only because of obvious advancements bringing online previously underserved or untapped populations, but also because they venture system has developed nicely in Singapore and, for that matter, across the region with support from institutional VCs at various stages of funding need, government agency support, the advent of local accelerators and rapidly growing network of angel investing bodies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parekh added that he expects to see more unicorns and &#8220;soonicorns&#8221; (or companies expected to hit unicorn valuation in the near future) emerge.</p>

<p>As early-stage, sector-agnostic investors, Parekh said MVP&#8217;s focus is on founders, specifically those who have &#8220;pedigree professional experience and strong academic backgrounds.&#8221; For example, Naluri chief executive officer Azran Osman-Rani was previously founder of AirAsiaX, guiding it from launch to its 2013 initial public offering in six years.</p>
<p>MVP will focus mostly on Singapore-based startups because it invests primarily in B2B or B2B2C companies. &#8220;We need a fertile ground for our chosen startups to launch their business models with leading corporate or business partners,&#8221; said Parekh. &#8220;Singapore provides just that. It&#8217;s the hub for market leading institutions and it’s not uncommon to see them creating opportunities for new technology or disruptive ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of MVP&#8217;s portfolio companies have &#8220;regional or global aspirations, leveraging Singapore as the core launch platform,&#8221; he added. MVP has also already made investments in Malaysia and India, and is actively looking at companies in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The historical trajectory of venture capital has been to move to earlier and earlier finding rounds in order to capture the greatest potential multiple on exit. In the US, we’ve seen an explosion of Pre-series A funds, and similarly in Europe. But there’s been an opportunity to tie a lot of that activity together and also produce data that can feed into decision-making about growth rounds, further up the funding pipeline. Now, newly-formed <a href="https://aldea.ventures/">Aldea Ventures</a> intends to do just that.</p>
<p>Today’s it’s announcing a €60M first close of its Pan-European fund with the aim of reaching its target €100M first fund. The idea is ambitious: to invest in 700 startups across Europe, but with an unusual, “hybrid” strategy. First up, it will operate as a fund-of-funds, investing in up to 20 early-stage ‘micro VC funds’ across Europe. Second of all, it will act as a co-investment platform from Series A upwards.  So far it has invested in London-based <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com/">Job and Talent</a> and most recently, Copenhagen-based <a href="https://podimo.com/en/">Podimo</a>.</p>
<p>The model is more common in Silicon Valley than in Europe, so Aldea Ventures hopes to capitalize on this trend as one of the earlier players with this strategy. Aldea is also effectively stepping into the gap where corporate VCs in the US would normally fill, but in Europe is generally a gaping hole.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aldea Ventures is led by managing partners Carlos Trenchs, formerly at Caixa Capital Risc; Alfonso Bassols, previously at Nauta Capital; Josep Duran, formerly with the European Investment Fund; and Gonzalo Rodés, Chairman. Aldea Ventures is partnering with Meridia Capital, a leading Spanish alternative investment fund manager.</p>
<p>Carlos Trenchs, managing partner of Aldea Ventures, said: “We believe Europe will continue to grow in influence and play an integral part in the next decade of technology… Our dual model as a fund of funds and co-investor into scaleups is the first of its kind in Europe. Seen only in Silicon Valley until today, we’re putting this model to work to fuel the next generation of growth across the European ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Aldea will look for five factors to selecting micro VCs: the firm&#8217;s thesis (specialist, thematic or generalist); location (pan-European or local); the experience of the partners; the size of the fund, and whether the fund is emerging or established. The fund will also take a long hard look at AI, Blockchain and DeepTech companies.</p>
<p>Trenchs explained to me during an interview that “we will have exposure to seed capital in different geographies with the 700 companies, and we reserve the other half of the fund to invest directly on the growth stage in the best performers in their portfolios.” This, he says, will establish a roadmap from direct investing all the way up to later-stage rounds.</p>
<p>Aldea has so far made investments into six micro VCs; <a href="https://www.airstreet.com/">Air Street Capital</a> and <a href="https://moonfire.com/">Moonfire</a> in London; <a href="https://www.helloworld.vc/">Helloworld</a> in Luxembourg; <a href="https://www.inventures.vc/">Inventures</a> in Munich; <a href="https://mustardseed.vc/mustard-seed-maze">Mustard Seed Maze</a> in Lisbon; and <a href="https://www.nina.capital/">Nina Capital</a> in Barcelona. </p>
<p>Nathan Benaich, Founding Partner of Air Street Capital, commented: “Investing in  European AI-first companies is a huge opportunity, with almost one-quarter of top global AI talent earning their university degrees here.. Our partnership with Aldea demonstrates a shared conviction that specialist managers with deep sector-specific knowledge will accelerate the success of tomorrow’s category-defining European companies that are AI-first by design.”</p>
<p>There&#8217;s clearly also a data play here because Aldea is likely to end up with a lot of data across companies, sectors and also across various stages.</p>
<p>And that was confirmed by Trenchs: “We want to make the VC world more transparent. If you have the 700 companies, in a few years from now, we&#8217;ll be able to collect a lot of data about what&#8217;s going on at seed stage in European valuations, geographies and sectors. Our intention is of course to use it as intelligence.” He also said the firm intended to share a lot of anonymized data with the wider European ecosystem.</p>
<p>“There is a funnel of few thousands of companies that get funded, but only a few make it through the funnel. As investors, we are looking for venture capitalists that can transform their seed portfolio into a portfolio that graduates from Series A to Series B,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kate Hiscox is having a moment. Her company, <a href="https://www.sivo.com/">Sivo</a>, founded eight months ago, has already raised $5 million from investors at a post-money valuation of $100 million, and she says she is in active talks with others who would like her to consider accepting Series A funding from them.</p>
<p>Surely the attention owes to the fact that Hiscox is part of the newest graduating class of the popular accelerator Y Combinator, along with roughly 350 other companies, and if there&#8217;s anything venture capitalists like, it&#8217;s freshly minted YC grads. Partly, fintech continues to be seen as a hugely lucrative area of investment.</p>
<p>But they also might like what Sivo aims to do, which is to strike deals with debt providers for gigantic credit lines that it will then, through its API, work with both big and small companies to disburse via their own lending products. Yes, Sivo is making interest off money that it&#8217;s simply divvying up into smaller amounts. But the real magic, says Hiscox, is in the risk management that Sivo provides. It doesn&#8217;t just parcel out debt; it helps its customers that don&#8217;t have their own risk management practices figure out who is worthy of a loan and how much.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hiscox &#8212; who has founded a number over the years, <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Venzee+Commences+Trading+on+the+TSX+Venture+Exchange+Under+Symbol+VENZ/13661426.html">one of which</a> she took public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2018 &#8212; calls it a Stripe for debt. But one question is how Stripe, among its other rivals, might feel about Sivo. Stripe was also once a YC company, it <a href="https://stripe.com/capital">also lends debt</a> to its customers, and it seemingly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/sequoia-is-giving-away-21-million-to-a-payments-startup-it-funded-as-it-walks-away-from-deal/">doesn&#8217;t like</a> when its investors fund emerging potential threats. Another question is how a company like Sivo fares when interest rates rise and the debt it borrows is no longer cheap.</p>
<p>Hiscox suggests she&#8217;s not worried about many roadblocks right now. We talked with her on Friday about the company in a conversation that follows, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re building what you describe as Stripe for debt. But isn&#8217;t Stripe&#8217;s loan business competitive with yours?</strong></p>
<p>KH: No. Sivo is the first YC company that&#8217;s building debt as a service.</p>
<p>The reason why is that it&#8217;s very difficult for fintechs and neobanks and gig platforms to be able to raise enough capital to be able to lend money to their users at scale; that generally takes a couple of years. What we&#8217;re building gets these companies access to debt capital on day one. Our team has decades of experience with risk and raising debt and building enterprise tech at companies like Goldman Sachs and NASA and Revolut and Citigroup.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Give me a use case.</strong></p>
<p>KH: So we have more than 100 companies now in our customer pipeline, including Uber. In the case of Uber, they want to be able to offer financial products to their drivers. Maybe it&#8217;s to fund a vehicle or provide a payday advance. But Uber really can&#8217;t do that because it doesn&#8217;t want to look like an employer, and it also doesn&#8217;t want to necessarily deal with risk modeling, meaning who in their big driver base has the right risk profile [to rationalize a loan]. You plug in Sivo, and we will cycle through the Uber driver base to figure out to whom it makes sense to make a loan offer, and we do it all this through the API.</p>
<p><strong>TC: But Uber is not yet a paying customer.</strong></p>
<p>KH: No, we go live next month; that&#8217;s an example of how Uber would use us. There are also a lot of neobanks that are three- to five-years-old and want to start lending and really don&#8217;t know have that risk experience they need to get access to debt capital in order to have the money to be able to lend to their customers. With something like Sivo, they&#8217;re able to integrate our service through our API, and we&#8217;re able to pretty much tell them who they should be lending to, how much they should lend, and then we offer the debt funding.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have any debt deals in place?</strong></p>
<p>KH: We signed a debt deal last week for $100 million and we&#8217;re working on another debt deal for close to $1 billion that will be announced next month.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who is your debt partner and how have you convinced them to lend so much to such a young outfit?</strong></p>
<p>KH: I&#8217;m not sure I can say publicly yet who we&#8217;re working with, but we source our capital through all the usual suspects &#8212; mutual funds, pension funds, banks &#8212; and we&#8217;re able to do this is because as soon as we announced that we were going to start doing this as a product, we had tons of customers come and say, &#8216;I want this. [Trying to do this ourselves] is long and complex and painful, and we want just want to be able to do it in a simple way, like we would use Stripe for payments.&#8217; We could fill our boots, quite frankly, with YC companies forever.</p>
<p>I also have a lot of experience because I&#8217;d taken a company public and have lots of connections in the capital markets, and so does our CFO.</p>
<p>And there are actually a lot of banks that would love more exposure to fintechs and to a basket of YC-backed fintechs in particular because they can get yield, but the check sizes are too small for a bank. There&#8217;s also concern that the fintechs don&#8217;t really have a lot of risk experience. Meanwhile, our team has a lot of gray hair as far as risk is concerned.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What kind of economic agreement do you have with that debt lender and what percentage of each loan will you charge your customers?</strong></p>
<p>KH: I really can&#8217;t tell you, including because it&#8217;s going to vary from fintech to fintech; some have more complicated user models, some have bigger user bases, some operate in different regions around the world. What I can say is that it&#8217;s an incredible time for us to access debt capital from institutions because interest rates are so low and even negative in some parts of Europe. You just have to have the right team to know where to go and get it.</p>
<p><strong>TC You&#8217;re also raised $5 million in seed equity funding already at a post-money valuation of $100 million, including from Andre Charoo of Maple VC, who says he&#8217;s written you his biggest check yet. Are you done raising equity funding for now? That&#8217;s already a very high valuation.</strong></p>
<p>KH: We&#8217;re trying to decide now if we&#8217;re going direct to a Series A. This is our first raise, but everybody &#8216;gets&#8217; our business model, so we&#8217;ve had an avalanche of investors, and some very big VCs now have reached out.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Obviously, interest rates will go up. What then?</strong></p>
<p>KH: When interest rates go up, all lending gets more expensive. I mean, there&#8217;s a pandemic right now and a lot of cash in the system, and there&#8217;s some talk about inflation, but we don&#8217;t really see interest rates going up for a few years.</p>
<p>Of course they will eventually rise, but when that happens, everybody&#8217;s rates will go up, whether you borrow on a credit card or from a traditional bank or a fintech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy consumption has become the latest flashpoint for cryptocurrency. Critics decry it as an energy hog while proponents hail it for being less intensive than the current global economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such critic, </span><a href="https://digiconomist.net/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DigiEconomist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founder Alex de Vries, said he’s “never seen anything that is as inefficient as bitcoin.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side of the debate, research by </span><a href="https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/bitcoin-myths/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ARK Investment Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found the Bitcoin ecosystem consumes less than 10% of the energy required for the traditional banking system. While it’s true the banking system serves far more people, cryptocurrency is still maturing and, like any industry, the early infrastructure stage is particularly intensive.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cryptocurrency mining industry, which garnered almost </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-miners-saw-record-1-36b-revenue-in-february"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in February 2021 alone, is not yet unusually terrible for the environment compared to other aspects of modern life in an industrialized society. Even de Vries told TechCrunch that if eco-conscious regulators “took all possible actions against Bitcoin, it’s unlikely you’d get all governments to go along with that” mining regulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ideally, change comes from within,” de Vries said, adding he hopes Bitcoin Core developers will alter the software to require less computational energy. “I think Bitcoin consumes </span><a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as much energy as all the world’s </span><a href="https://energyinnovation.org/2020/03/17/how-much-energy-do-data-centers-really-use/#:~:text=The%20finding%20that%20global%20data,past%20decade%20(Figure%202)."><span style="font-weight: 400;">data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the moment.”    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the University of Cambridge’s </span><a href="https://cbeci.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bitcoin electricity consumption index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, bitcoin miners are expected to consume roughly 130 Terawatt-hours of energy (TWh), which is roughly </span><a href="https://cbeci.org/cbeci/comparisons"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.6%</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of global electricity consumption. This puts the bitcoin economy on par with the </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-tesla-climate-insight/elon-musk-wants-clean-power-but-teslas-carrying-bitcoins-dirty-baggage-idUSKBN2AA193"><span style="font-weight: 400;">carbon dioxide emissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a small, developing nation like Sri Lanka or Jordan. Jordan, in particular, is home to </span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=JO"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 million people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s impossible to say </span><a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2017-04-20-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how many people use bitcoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every month, and they certainly use it less often than residents in Amman use Jordanian dinars. But </span><a href="https://coinmetrics.io/charts/#assets=btc_left=AdrActCnt_zoom=1582934400000,1614470400000"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinMetrics </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">data indicates more than 1 million bitcoin addresses are active, daily, out of up to </span><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/hfgyig42jimx/5u8QqK4lqjEgL506mOx4m3/d44d8e204aecfc75a839e2a9d505f5d1/Crypto.com_Data_Report_-_On-chain_Market_Sizing.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">106 million </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounts active in the past decade, as tallied by the exchange Crypto.com. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We get the total population of unique bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) users by counting the total number of addresses from listed exchanges, subtracting addresses owned by the same users on multiple exchanges,” said a Crypto.com spokesperson. “We then further reduce this number by accounting for users who own both ETH and BTC.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a lot of people using these financial networks. Plus, many bitcoin mining businesses rely on environmentally friendly energy sources like hydropower and capturing natural gas leaks from oil fields. A mining industry veteran, Compass Mining COO Thomas Heller, said Chinese hydropower mines in Sichuan and Yunnan get cheaper electricity during the wet season. They continue to use hydropower all year, he added, although it’s less profitable during the annual dry season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The electricity price outside of May to October [wet season] is much more expensive,” Heller said. “However, some farms do have water supply in other parts of the year.”</span></p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, cryptocurrency mining doesn’t inherently produce extra carbon emissions because computers can use power from any source. In 2019, the digital asset investing firm CoinShares released a study estimating up to </span><a href="https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-december-2019"><span style="font-weight: 400;">73%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of bitcoin miners use at least some renewable energy as part of their power supply, including </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-city-known-for-bitcoin-mining-seeks-blockchain-firms-to-burn-excess-hydropower"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hydropower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from China’s massive dams. All of the top five </span><a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bitcoin mining pools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, consortiums for miners to cooperate for better profit margins, rely heavily on hydropower. This statistic doesn’t impress de Vries, who pointed out that Cambridge researchers found renewable energy makes up </span><a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">39%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of miners&#8217; total energy consumption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I put one solar panel on my power plant, I also have a mixture of renewable energy,” de Vries said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of geographic distribution, Cambridge data indicates Chinese bitcoin mining operations represent around </span><a href="https://cbeci.org/mining_map"><span style="font-weight: 400;">65% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the network’s power, called hashrate. In some regions, like China’s </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/tesla-s-bitcoin-binge-spells-overtime-for-xinjiang-coal-miners"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xinjiang province</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, bitcoin miners also burn coal for electricity. Beyond cryptocurrency mining, this province is known for human rights abuses against the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uighur population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which China is violently suppressing as part of a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/01/at-least-50-reported-dead-in-september-attack-as-china-celebrates-xinjiang"><span style="font-weight: 400;">broader struggle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to capitalize on the region’s </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/world/asia/china-invests-in-xinjiang-region-rich-in-oil-coal-and-also-strife.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When </span><a href="https://qz.com/1978807/bitcoin-has-a-xinjiang-problem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sound the alarm about cryptocurrency mining and energy consumption, this is often the dynamic they’re concerned about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, North American miners make up roughly </span><a href="https://cbeci.org/mining_map"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8%</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of the </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/how-bitcoins-price-slump-is-changing-the-geography-of-mining"><span style="font-weight: 400;">global hashrate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, followed closely by miners in Russia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cheap-power-lures-crypto-miners-to-iran-but-its-not-as-easy-as-it-sounds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iran</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called for the creation of a </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rouhani-bitcoin-mining-iran"><span style="font-weight: 400;">national bitcoin mining strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020, aiming to grow the Islamic nation’s influence over this financial system despite </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/iranian-general-advocates-crypto-use-for-skirting-sanctions-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banking sanctions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> imposed by the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wherever nations and organizations offer the most profitable </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/39718/bitcoin-miners-in-china-lose-access-to-cheap-electricity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mining regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, those are the places where bitcoin mining will proliferate. Chinese dominance, to date, can be at least partially attributed to </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/chinas-mining-subsidies-create-tension-free-trade-rules"><span style="font-weight: 400;">government subsidies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the mining industry. As such, nations like </span><a href="https://qz.com/1172632/chinas-dominance-in-bitcoin-mining-under-threat-as-regulators-hit-where-it-hurts-electricity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-27/bitcoin-miners-in-nordic-region-get-a-boost-from-cheap-power"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norway</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer subsidies that incentivize bitcoin miners to use local hydropower sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the</span><a href="https://www.seetee.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Seetee research report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/aker-bitcoin/norways-aker-asa-sets-up-bitcoin-unit-idUSL1N2L60AE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aker ASA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a $6 billion public company based in Norway, said: “The financiers of min­ing op­er­a­tions will in­sist on us­ing the cheap­est en­er­gy and so by de­f­i­n­i­tion it will be elec­tric­i­ty that has no bet­ter eco­nom­ic use.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to make cryptocurrency mining more eco-friendly is to support lawmakers that want to encourage mining in regions that already have underutilized energy sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to North America, Blockstream CEO Adam Back says his company’s mining facilities, with </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockstream-microbt-bitcoin-mining"><span style="font-weight: 400;">300 megawatts </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in mining capacity, rely on a mix of industrial power sources like hydropower. He added Blockstream is exploring solar-powered bitcoin mining options as a sort of “retirement home” for outdated machines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With solar energy, if you’re only online 50% of the time, that’s something to consider in terms of the cost analysis,” Back said. “That’s a better option for older machines, after you’ve already recouped the costs of the equipment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to surging cryptocurrency prices, there’s now a </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-china-mining/global-chip-shortage-hits-chinas-bitcoin-mining-sector-idUSKBN29R1AY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">global shortage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of bitcoin mining equipment, Back added, with demand outpacing supply and production taking up to six months per machine. Emma Todd, founder of the consultancy MMH Blockchain Group, said the shortage is driving up the price of mining machines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, a Bitmain Antminer S9 mining machine that used to cost $35 &#8211; $55 in July 2020 on the secondary market, now costs about $275 &#8211; $300,” Todd said. “This means that most, if not all mining companies looking to purchase new or secondary equipment, are all experiencing the same challenges. As a result of the global chip shortage, most new mining equipment that is scheduled to come out in the next few months, will almost certainly be delayed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics like de Vries point out that, due to market forces, industrial miners are unlikely to reduce their power consumption with new machines, which are more efficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you have more efficient machines but earn the same money, then people just run two machines instead of one,” de Vries said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, because cryptocurrency prices are rising faster than new miners can be constructed, Back said “retiring” old machines with renewable energy sources becomes more profitable than simply abandoning them for new equipment. In addition, Back said, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/bitcoin-miner-is-scoring-700-profits-selling-energy-to-grid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">robust bitcoin mining infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can </span><a href="https://www.coincenter.org/how-bitcoin-could-drive-the-clean-energy-revolution/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support communities </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">rather than draining resources. This is because bitcoin miners can help </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2020/05/21/how-this-billionaire-backed-crypto-startup-gets-paid-to-not-mine-bitcoin/?sh=14ac8ae37596"><span style="font-weight: 400;">store and arbitrage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> energy flows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can turn miners on and off if you get to a surge prices situation, you can use the power for people to heat their homes if that’s more urgent or more profitable,” Back said. “Bitcoin could actually support power grids.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, just north of the Canadian border, Upstream Data president Steve Barbour said a growing number of traditional oil and gas companies are quietly ramping up their own bitcoin mining operations. </span></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now it’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaPosch/status/1364915550032457732"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hydro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and coal. That’s the majority of the big industrial mining. But on the global scale, that’s going to shift more toward any cheap power, including natural gas,” Barbour said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oil fields already have cheap energy with the venting flares, the waste gas, there’s potential for approximately 160 gigawatts [of mining power] this year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upstream Data helps oil companies set up and operate bitcoin miners in a way that captures waste and low quality gas, which they couldn’t sell before, totaling 100 deployments across North America. These companies rarely go public with their bitcoin mining operations, Barbour said, because they’re concerned about attracting negative press from Bitcoin critics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are definitely concerned about reputational risk, but I think that’s going to change soon because you have big, credible companies like Tesla involved with Bitcoin,” Barbour said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even within the cryptocurrency industry, there are many people who dislike how power-intensive bitcoin mining is and are experimenting with different mining methods. For example, the Ethereum community is trying to switch to a “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/02/the-collapse-of-eth-is-inevitable/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proof-of-stake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” (PoS) mining model, powering the network with locked up coins instead of Bitcoin’s intensive “proof-of-work” (PoW) model. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Is rising usage driving crypto&#8217;s recent price boom?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/embed/#?secret=hj2r8j3R5p" data-secret="hj2r8j3R5p" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name might suggest, PoW requires a lot of computational “work.” That’s what miners do, lots and lots of math problems that are so difficult the computers require a lot of electricity. With regards to Ethereum, which currently runs on PoW but will theoretically run on PoS in a few years, there are</span><a href="https://etherscan.io/chart/active-address"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hundreds of thousands </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of </span><a href="https://coinmetrics.io/charts/#assets=btc,eth_left=AdrActCnt_zoom=1279411200000,1614470400000"><span style="font-weight: 400;">daily active addresses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sometimes half as many as Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin, a few industrial mining projects with facilities in China generate more than half of the </span><a href="https://etherscan.io/stat/miner?range=7&amp;blocktype=blocks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum network’s power.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Each Ethereum transaction requires nearly as much energy as </span><a href="https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two American households </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">use per day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I like about the Ethereum community is at least they are thinking about how to solve the problem,” de Vries said. “What I don’t like is they’ve been talking about it for a few years and haven’t been able to actually do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum ecosystem uses enough energy every year to power the nation of </span><a href="https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Like Bitcoin, each Ethereum transaction costs enough for </span><a href="https://blog.trezor.io/three-myths-about-bitcoins-energy-consumption-ef613a1f3d5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electricity costs </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the money could also buy a nice lunch. Both of these networks require enough power to fuel small countries, although Ethereum usually has </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-activity-metric-hit-highest-level-for-2-years"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than half </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the million daily users that Bitcoin has. It’s clear cryptocurrency transactions require more power than Visa transactions. However, a cryptocurrency isn’t just a payments company. It is a whole currency system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the bitcoin market cap were ranked as a country, by the </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/39425/bitcoin-is-now-the-5th-largest-world-currency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">value of the money supply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bitcoin would come in fifth place behind Japan. And that’s not even considering adjacent ecosystems like Ethereum. In short, power consumption in the global Bitcoin economy is comparable to that of some other industrialized financial systems. It is inefficient, as de Vries points out, as are many of the systems used in emerging economies. Out of millions of users, </span><a href="https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2017-04-20-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thousands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of people </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/what-its-really-like-to-live-on-bitcoin-in-the-middle-east"><span style="font-weight: 400;">around the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rely on </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkd83y/people-are-spending-millions-on-jpegs-tweets-and-other-crypto-collectibles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrency for income</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are generally optimistic about the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/how-emerging-markets-are-approaching-crypto/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrency ecosystem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, believing it will become more efficient as the technology matures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see Bitcoin mining increasingly playing a role in the transition to a clean, modern and more decentralized energy system,” said one such Canadian business consultant, Magdalena Gronowska. “Miners can provide grid balancing and flexible demand-response services and improve renewables integration.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>.</em></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Earnings season is coming to a close, with public tech companies wrapping up their Q4 and 2020 disclosures. We don’t care too much about the bigger players’ results here at TechCrunch, but smaller tech companies we knew when they were wee startups can provide startup-related data points worth digesting. So, each quarter The Exchange spends time chatting with a host of CEOs and CFOs, trying to figure what’s going on so that we can relay the information to private companies.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s useful, as our chat with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/inside-fintech-startup-upstarts-ipo-filing/">recent fintech IPO Upstart</a> proved after we got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/ai-fintech-products-are-operating-at-scale-and-investor-interest-is-maturing/">to noodle with the company</a> about rising acceptance of AI in the conservative banking industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week we caught up with Yext CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/howard">Howard Lerman</a> and Smartsheet CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/markmader">Mark Mader</a>. Yext builds data products for small businesses, and is <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/361531/how-yext-moves-website-search-closer-to-a-google-l.html">betting its future on search products</a>. Smartsheet is a software company that works in the collaboration, no-code and future-of-work spaces.</p>
<p>They are pretty different companies, really. But what they did share this time &#8217;round the earnings cycle were macro notes, or details regarding their forward financial guidance and what economic conditions they anticipate. As a macro-nerd, it piqued my interest.</p>
<p>Yext cited a number of macroeconomic headwinds when it reported its Q4 results. And tying its future results somewhat to an uncertain macro picture, the company <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/03/yext-inc-yext-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">said that it is</a> “basing [its] guidance on the business conditions [it sees for itself] and [its] customers currently, with the macro economy, which remains sluggish, and customers who remain cautious,” per a transcript.</p>
<p>Lerman told The Exchange that it was not clear when the world would open &#8212; something that matters for Yext’s location-focused products &#8212; so the company was guiding for the year as if nothing would change. Wall Street didn’t love it, but if the economy improves Yext won’t have high hurdles to jump over. This is one tack that a company can take when it talks guidance.</p>
<p>Smartsheet took a slightly different approach, saying in <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/16/smartsheet-inc-smar-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcri/">its earnings call</a> that its “fiscal year &#8217;22 guidance contemplates a gradual improvement in the macro environment in the second half of the year.” Mader said in an interview that his company wasn’t hiring economists, but was instead simply listening to what others were saying.</p>
<p>He also said that the macro climate matters more in saturated markets, which he doesn’t think that Smartsheet is in; so, its results should be more impacted by things more like “the secular shift to the cloud and digital transformation,” to quote its earnings call.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI fintech products are operating at scale and investor interest is maturing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/ai-fintech-products-are-operating-at-scale-and-investor-interest-is-maturing/embed/#?secret=KkH7W7LI1B" data-secret="KkH7W7LI1B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>What the economy will do this year matters quite a lot for startups. An improving economy could boost interest rates, making money a bit more expensive and bonds more attractive. Valuations could see modest downward pressure in that case. And venture capital could slow fractionally. But with Yext forecasting as if it was facing a flat road and Smartsheet only expecting things to pick up pace from Q3 on, it’s likely that what we have now is mostly what we’ll get.</p>
<p>And things are pretty damn good for startups and late-stage liquidity at the moment. So, smooth sailing ahead for startup-land? At least as far as our current perspective can discern.</p>
<p>We still have a grip of notes from Splunk CEO Douglas Merritt on how to take an old-school software company and turn it into a cloud-first company, and Jamf CEO Dean Hager about packaging discrete software products. More to come from them in fits.</p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>There were rounds big and small this week. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/squarespace-raises-300m-at-staggering-10b-valuation/">Squarespace raised $300 million</a>, while Airtable <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/">raised $277 million</a>. On the smaller-end of the spectrum, my favorite round of the week was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">modest $2.9 million raise from Copy.ai</a>.</p>
<p>But there were other rounds that TechCrunch didn’t get to that are still worth our time. So, here are a few more for you to dig into this weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">A so-called pre-Series A round for <a href="https://www.intelligentlilli.com/">Lilli</a>, a U.K.-based startup that uses sensors and other tech to track the well-being of folks who might need help to live on their own. Using tech to take care of folks is always good by me. The deal was worth £4.5 million, <a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/uk-saas-company-lilli-funding-20210318">per UKTN</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">An IPO for Tuya, a Chinese software company that <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-tuya-poised-raise-915-012627944.html">raised $915 million in its American debut</a>. Chinese IPOs on American indices were once a big deal. They are less frequent now. Surprised that I missed this one, but, hey, there’s been a lot going on.</li>
<li aria-level="1">And the Republic round, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210317005272/en/Republic-Announces-36M-Series-A-to-Democratize-Access-to-Investing-for-Everyone">worth $36 million</a>, that is banking on the recently-expanded American crowdfunding regulations. Some startups have seen success with the approach, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/how-vcs-and-founders-see-2021-differently/">including Juked.gg</a>.</li>

<h2>Upcoming attractions</h2>
<p>Next week is Y Combinator Demo Day week, so expect a lot of early-stage coverage on the blog. Here’s a preview. From The Exchange we’re looking back into insurtech (with data from WeFox and Insurify), and talking about Austin-based software startup AlertMedia’s decision to sell itself to private-equity instead of raising more traditional capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A proposed witness list filed by Apple for its upcoming trial against game-maker Epic reads like a who’s who of executives from the two companies. The drawn out battle could well prove a watershed moment from mobile app payments.</p>
<p>The two sides came to loggerheads when the Fortnite maker was kicked out of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games/">App Store in August</a> of last year after adding an in-game payment system designed to bypass Apple’s – along with Apple’s cut of the profiles.</p>
<p>Epic has accused Apple of monopolist practices pertaining to mobile payment. Apple, meanwhile, has argued that Epic broke the App Store agreement in order to increase its revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Filed late last night by the hardware giant, the document includes top executives from bot sides. For Apple, the list includes CEO Tim Cook, Software Engineering SVP Craig Federighi and Apple Fellow, Phil Schiller. On team Epic, it’s Tim Sweeney and VP Mark Rein. Executives from Microsoft, Facebook and NVIDIA are also included, for good measure.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to TechCrunch, Apple notes,</p>
<blockquote><p>Our senior executives look forward to sharing with the court the very positive impact the App Store has had on innovation, economies across the world and the customer experience over the last 12 years. We feel confident the case will prove that Epic purposefully breached its agreement solely to increase its revenues, which is what resulted in their removal from the App Store. By doing that, Epic circumvented the security features of the App Store in a way that would lead to reduced competition and put consumers’ privacy and data security at tremendous risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>The trial is expected to kick off May 3. We&#8217;ve reached out to Epic for additional comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/julia-collins-and-sarah-kunst-outline-how-to-build-a-fundraising-process/">Extra Crunch Live</a> this past week, Cleo Capital founding partner Sarah Kunst broke down what founders can learn from Supreme, a sought-after streetwear brand. She argued that founders, similar to Supreme, should build a brand around themselves that is so well-respected and has clout that whenever they start something new, investors will line up.</p>
<p>“A Supreme shirt that costs $100 bucks in the store will cost $1,000 online so, as an investor, I am just a kid on the street corner flipping sportswear,” Kunst mentioned. &#8220;Who do I think is going to be an investment with such velocity that getting in early is going to be more than worth it as they grow.”</p>
<p>I think this is the best framing I’ve seen about how to drum up excitement for a startup as a founder. FOMO isn’t a strategy, it’s a tactic. What really works, as Kunst alluded to, is when founders can point to key insights they’ve had throughout their career beyond the context of a fundraising process. In other words, anyone can create a nice t-shirt and slap a logo on it. Which founder in this sector is going to give it meaning? It might be the one with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/edge-pathways-seed/">big former exit</a>, the one that was the first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/julia-collins-and-sarah-kunst-outline-how-to-build-a-fundraising-process/">Black woman to ever build a unicorn</a>, or the one that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/nigerias-termii-raises-1-4m-seed-led-by-future-africa-and-kepple-africa-ventures/">was on the ground facing the pain point they now want to solve. </a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We get into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/julia-collins-and-sarah-kunst-outline-how-to-build-a-fundraising-process/">how to build a fundraising process</a>, the concept of soft-circling an investor and what Kunst says is one of her biggest pet-peeves in a pitch deck on the site, but I wanted to give you that sneak peek for now.</p>

<h2><strong>A seedy asset class </strong></h2>
<p>Per Climate Editor Jonathan Shieber, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/farmland-could-be-the-next-big-asset-class-modernized-by-marketplace-startups/">farmland could become the next big asset class </a>modernized by marketplace startups.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> One startup, AcreTrader, is trying to create a Robinhood for buying farmland, which I think is indicative of how lucrative some view a patch of land. CEO Carter Malloy thinks that while private equity often gets press for being in the land game, most land is owned by smaller ownership through families.</p>
<p>“Over the last few months, we’ve consistently seen our offering sizes grow while our funding windows shrink, showcasing the fast-growing desire surrounding this resilient asset class,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/"> poured</a>  $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week, there was a lot of headline-making app ecosystem news, including Google&#8217;s impactful decision to drop its Play Store commissions, an App Store lawsuit over scammy apps with fake ratings, battles over Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency and the arrival of a notable new feature on YouTube &#8212; a TikTok rival called Shorts.</p>

<h3>Developer sues Apple over lost revenue due to App Store scams</h3>

<p>Kosta Eleftheriou, a co-founder of the Fleksy keyboard app, has been raising awareness about App Store scams in recent weeks, after his own app was targeted by copycat subscription scammers leveraging fake ratings and reviews to gain traction. This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">Eleftheriou filed a lawsuit that attempts to hold Apple accountable</a> for his own app&#8217;s lost revenue, saying that Apple promises developers a safe and trustworthy marketplace, but then allows these scammers to operate to the detriment of legitimate apps like his own. Though some news articles positioned the case as some sort of antitrust lawsuit, it&#8217;s really more focused on scammers and the accountability Apple has for how its App Store operates, which apps are listed and how well it&#8217;s managed and policed. Eleftheriou is asking Apple to compensate him for his lost revenue and other damages as a result of Apple&#8217;s ill-run app marketplace, as well as what he claims are unfair App Review rejections.</p>
<h3>Google Play drops commissions to 15% on some earnings</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2004747" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2004747" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2004747" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?w=680" alt="Google Play Store screen" width="680" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=1536,989 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=2048,1318 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2004747" class="wp-caption-text">Google Play Store screen</p></div></p>
<p>Google has followed Apple&#8217;s lead in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">reducing commissions for the Google Play store</a>. But in its case, it has <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/boosting-dev-success.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FhsDu+%28Android+Developers+Blog%29">dropped</a> commissions from 30% to 15% on developers&#8217; first $1 million in revenue. Apple, by comparison, starts charging 30% once the developer tops $1 million. Google said 99% of developers who sell goods and services through the Play Store will see a 50% reduction in fees. According to App Annie data, very few Google Play developers make more than $1 million &#8212; in fact, only 2,035 developers do on Google Play, compared with 3,611 on iOS. To put this in perspective in terms of revenue, developers making up to $1 million in consumer spend only comprised 5% of total Google Play consumer spend in 2020, the firm noted.</p>

<h3>Apple&#8217;s ATT scores a win in France</h3>
<p>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">fended off an attempt by advertisers in France</a> who wanted to derail the IDFA change in iOS, which will require users&#8217; permission in order to track them. The complaint had attempted to contrast Apple&#8217;s ATT (App Tracking Transparency) requirements for third parties with Apple&#8217;s own, where its first-party apps are allow to track by default for the purpose of personalizing ads in various Apple apps. France’s competition regulator decided Apple&#8217;s plans &#8220;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-scores-legal-win-in-france-over-app-privacy-changes-11615971737?mod=djemalertNEWS">don&#8217;t appear to be abusive</a>&#8221; and said it can&#8217;t intervene just because some apps may see a negative impact. But the authority did say it will investigate Apple further to determine if any of its changes are &#8220;self-preferencing.&#8221;</p>

It&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">now coming to the U.S. in its first major expansion</a>. The feature, still in beta, offers a very TikTok-like experience both in terms of recording content and viewing. Users can tap to record video segments for up to 60-second long videos, and use a small handful of editing features like text captions, countdown timers and speed controls. Meanwhile, viewing the videos is also presented in a TikTok-like format with vertical feeds of video where you can double-tap to like, duck into comments or tap on hashtags or sounds to participate in trends.</p>

<p>YouTube believes the feature has potential because it&#8217;s connected to the larger YouTube ecosystem, including YouTube Music and the main platform itself &#8212; you can subscribe to YouTube channels right from Shorts, for example. But Shorts lacks a lot of what makes TikTok successful for the time being, like its numerous AR effects and editing tools, sound sync and its ability for creators to react and respond to other videos through stitches and duets.</p>

<p><strong>A government-backed consortium of Chinese companies <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/16/chinese-apps-test-bypass-for-apples-app-tracking-transparency">introduced</a> a new method for tracking iPhone users as an alternative to IDFA</strong> (paywalled source: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/520ccdae-202f-45f9-a516-5cbe08361c34">FT</a>). The system could be a workaround for Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency, as it won&#8217;t require user permission. Tencent and ByteDance are reportedly testing the system, known as CAID.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook develops a new way to interact with AR, Uber&#8217;s facial recognition policy faces scrutiny and SpaceX&#8217;s Starship rocket booster hits a major milestone. This is your Daily Crunch for March 19, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Facebook shows off wrist-based interface</strong></p>
<p>This project comes out of Facebook Reality Labs and is supposed to present <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/facebook-showcases-wrist-worn-ar-interface-concept/">an alternative computer interface on your wrist</a>, with electromyography sensors to interpret motor nerve signals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a blog post, Facebook said a wrist-based device &#8220;could reasonably fit into everyday life and social contexts,&#8221; while allowing the company to &#8220;bring the rich control capabilities of your hands into AR, enabling intuitive, powerful and satisfying interaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook identifies this as a research prototype, so don&#8217;t expect it to turn into a commercial product anytime soon. But it&#8217;s still suggestive, particularly given the company&#8217;s sometimes-surprising hardware strategy and rumors that it might be working on an Apple Watch competitor.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This column aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in but not limited to artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Research papers come out far too rapidly for anyone to read them all, especially in the field of machine learning, which now affects (and produces papers in) practically every industry and company. This column aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in but not limited to artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>This week brings a few unusual applications of or developments in machine learning, as well as a particularly unusual rejection of the method for pandemic-related analysis.</p>
<p>One hardly expects to find machine learning in the domain of government regulation, if only because one assumes federal regulators are hopelessly behind the times when it comes to this sort of thing. So it may surprise you that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has partnered with researchers at Stanford to<a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/03/08/assessing-regulatory-fairness-machine-learning/"> algorithmically root out violators of environmental rules</a>.</p>
<p>When you see the scope of the issue, it makes sense. EPA authorities need to process millions of permits and observations pertaining to Clean Water Act compliance, things such as self-reported amounts of pollutants from various industries and independent reports from labs and field teams. The Stanford-designed process sorted through these to isolate patterns like which types of plants, in which areas, were most likely to affect which demographics. For instance, wastewater treatment in urban peripheries may tend to underreport pollution and put communities of color at risk.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pj4xD71NMX8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The very process of reducing the compliance question to something that can be computationally parsed and compared helped clarify the agency&#8217;s priorities, showing that while the technique could identify more permit holders with small violations, it may draw attention away from general permit types that act as a fig leaf for multiple large violators.</p>
<p>Another large source of waste and expense is processing scrap metal. Tons of it goes through sorting and recycling centers, where the work is still mostly done by humans, and as you might imagine, it&#8217;s a dangerous and dull job. <a href="https://earthryse.prowly.com/130625-eversteel-ai-based-image-recognition-technology-for-sorting-steel-scraps">Eversteel is a startup out of the University of Tokyo</a> that aims to automate the process so that a large proportion of the work can be done before human workers even step in.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126624" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impurity_detection.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126624" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2126624" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impurity_detection.jpg" alt="Image of scrap metal with AI-detected labels for various kinds of items overlaid." width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impurity_detection.jpg 2170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=1536,767 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=2048,1023 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126624" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Eversteel</p></div></p>
<p>Eversteel uses a computer vision system to classify incoming scrap into nearly two dozen categories, and to flag impure (i.e., an unrecyclable alloy) or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg-PDmfuha4">anomalous items</a> for removal. It&#8217;s still at an early stage, but the industry isn&#8217;t going anywhere, and the lack of any large data set for training their models (they had to make their own, informed by steelworkers and imagery) showed Eversteel that this was indeed virgin territory for AI. With luck, they&#8217;ll be able to commercialize their system and attract the funding they need to break into this large but tech-starved industry.</p>
<p>Another unusual but potentially helpful application of computer vision is in soil monitoring, a task every farmer has to do regularly to monitor water and nutrient levels. When they do manage to automate it, it&#8217;s done in a rather heavy-handed way. A team from the University of South Australia and Middle Technical University in Baghdad show that the sensors, hardware and thermal cameras used now may be overkill.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, their answer is a standard RGB digital camera, which analyzes the color of the soil to estimate moisture. &#8220;We tested it at different distances, times and illumination levels, and the system was very accurate,&#8221; said Ali Al-Naji, one of the creators. It could (and is planned to) be used to make a cheap but effective smart irrigation system that could improve crop yield for those who can&#8217;t afford industry-standard systems.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most American retail banks are designed the same way: Customers must pass several desks set aside for loan and mortgage officers before they can talk to a customer representative.</p>
<p>I only step inside a bank a few times each year, but even pre-pandemic, I can&#8217;t remember the last time I saw someone sitting at one of those desks. Everyone I know who&#8217;s obtained a home or business loan in the recent past started with an online application process.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/ai-fintech-products-are-operating-at-scale-and-investor-interest-is-maturing/">this morning&#8217;s column</a>, Alex Wilhelm interviewed Dave Girouard, CEO of Upstart, an AI-powered fintech lender that expects to see growth increase 114% this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A forecast like that suggests that retail banks have gotten comfortable with using automated tools to calculate risk, which may help explain all the empty desks at my local branch.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Upstart hits its 2021 numbers, we will be able to read into them broader adoption of AI among old-guard firms,&#8221; says Alex.</p>
<p>According to PitchBook, investors are also more bullish on AI: Q4 2020 saw record funding for AI and ML startups, and exit totals are increasing as well.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t mind adding a gently used desk to my home office; perhaps I should call my bank and see if they have one to spare.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch. Have a great weekend!</p>

<p>Data is a gold mine for a company. If managed well, it provides the clarity and insights that lead to better decision-making at scale, in addition to an important tool to hold everyone accountable.</p>
<p>However, most companies are stuck in Data 1.0.</p>

<p>The increasing demand for AI and data science experts, driven in part by the pandemic’s economic impact, is showing no sign of abating.</p>
<p>Many employers are failing to identify viable job candidates, much less interviewing or hiring them. What’s holding them back?</p>
<p>Often, it&#8217;s a poorly drafted job posting.</p>

<p>I knew African founders lacked the same access to capital as entrepreneurs based in Europe or the United States, but the numbers are far less favorable than I thought.</p>
<p>According to Dauda Barry, CEO of Adaplay Esports, African startups have raised $500 million so far in 2021. If that trend continues, he estimates that the region&#8217;s tech companies will exceed the $1.4 billion they raised in 2020.</p>
<p>For perspective: &#8220;Stripe raised more yesterday than Barry had reported for the entire African continent this year,&#8221; Alex Wilhelm noted in today&#8217;s column.</p>
<p>Digging deeper, he pulled numbers from Crunchbase and PitchBook to track VC activity in Africa over the last three months. Once he filtered private equity funding from nonequity investments, the numbers were &#8220;staggering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am surprised that more VCs aren’t investing in Africa,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;It smells like investing arbitrage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Companies that help farmers raise money for agricultural development projects are revolutionizing the way farm and forestland are acquired, developed and commercialized across the United States.</p>
<p>While private equity has gotten a lot of press for expanding the size of their farmland investments, those investments are still dwarfed by the size of the potential farm industry in the U.S., meaning there’s still plenty of opportunity for investors to provide additional capital.</p>

<p>Stripe’s $600 million round values the payments and banking software company at $95 billion, near the top end of the valuation range at which the company was said to be raising funds back in November 2020.</p>

<h2>Julia Collins and Sarah Kunst outline how to build a fundraising process</h2>

<p>Julia Collins, the first Black woman to co-found a venture-backed unicorn, and investor Sarah Kunst offer fundraising pointers on Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>Kunst says good design is critical, but:</p>
<p>If you’re not a graphic designer, then any incremental minute that you’re spending on trying to make your deck pretty is a waste of time. You need to be focusing on content. Hire somebody, pay them a tiny bit of money to be able to do a nice graphics pass on your deck, and it’s going to make it a lot easier for people to to get the information that you need them to know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.abodu.com/">Abodu</a>, one of a slew of startup companies pitching backyard homes and office spaces to Californians in an effort to help address the state&#8217;s housing shortage, has instituted a new &#8220;Quickship&#8221; program that can take an order from contract to construction and installation in about thirty days.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Behind the quick turnaround time is a pre-approval process that was first rolled out in San Jose, Calif. and came to Los Angeles in recent weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Abodu began installing homes through a pre-approval process back in 2019, when the city of San Jose created a program that allowed developers of alternative dwelling units to submit plans for pre-approval to cut the time for homeowners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">That approval process means that ADU developers like Abodu can be permitted in one hour. Other ADU developers pre-approved in San Jose, Calif. include <a href="https://actonadu.com/">Acton ADU</a>, the venture backed <a href="https://connect-homes.com/">Connect Homes</a>, <a href="https://www.getadu.com/">J. Kretschmer Architect</a>, <a href="http://www.mayberryworkshop.com/adu">Mayberry Workshop</a>, <a href="https://www.openremodel.com/">Open Remodel</a>, and <a href="https://www.prefabadu.com/">prefabADU</a>. In Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.mas.la/project-selection-new">La Mas</a>, IT House, Design, Bitches, Connect Homes, <a href="https://www.welcomeprojects.com/">Welcome Projects</a> and <a href="http://firstoff.net/projects/LA_ADU/">First Office</a> have all had homes pre-approved for construction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond the cities where Abodu&#8217;s ADUs have received pre-approval, the company has built across California in cities ranging from, Palo Alto, Millbrae, Orange County, to LA and Oakland. Units in the Bay Area cost roughly $189,000 as a starting price, compared to the $650,000 to $850,000 it takes to build units in a mid-rise apartment building, or $1 million per unit in a steel-reinforced highrise, according to the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our Quickship program is the fastest way to add housing,” said John Geary, CEO at Abodu.  “Homeowners with immediate needs, be it family situations or those looking for investment income, can now complete an ADU project in as little as four weeks. A key mission for Abodu is to make a serious dent in our state’s housing deficit while providing people and municipalities the necessary blueprint to enact real change. ”</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Initialized partner (and former TechCrunch writer) Kim-Mai Cutler, who serves on the Abodu board of directors, the achievement of a 30 day construction milestone is almost a dream come true. Cutler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/">wrote the book (or the equivalent of a book)</a> on the housing crisis and its impact on the Bay Area and California broadly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That piece led Cutler to work in public service &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">on boards and commissions </span><a href="https://hsh.sfgov.org/committees/lhcb/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overseeing the spending of federal dollars on homelessness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Clerk/Commissions/Commissions__Measure_O_Bond_Oversight_Committee.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the proceeds of municipal bonds directed at financing affordable housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">because yes, for some segments of residents, you do have to explicitly subsidize housing at the local level.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">),&#8221; as she noted in a blog post about her investment in </span>Abodu.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2062908" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2062908" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2062908" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSF1364.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSF1364.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSF1364.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSF1364.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSF1364.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSF1364.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSF1364.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSF1364.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSF1364.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2062908" class="wp-caption-text">The interior of an Abodu home. Photo via Abodu.</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">Cutler backed the company because of her deep knowledge of the issues associated with housing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The reason this is a big deal is because Northern California </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/25/new-bay-area-crown-most-expensive-place-to-build-in-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been the most expensive and unpredictable place to build new housing in the world.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Projects typically take several years because of uncertainty with entitlements and materials,&#8221; Cutler wrote. &#8220;Over the past year, Abodu co-founders </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johngeary93"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Geary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-mcinerney-37a9154a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric McInerney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have put homes in the backyards of parents bringing kids home from college, a mother-and-son pair that each bought one for their homes in Millbrae, a couple looking to eventually house a grandmother in San Jose and on and on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The key inspiration that Abodu&#8217;s founders hit on was their concentration on granny flats, casitas and backyard dwellings. &#8220;While deliberations over mid-rise density were stalling in Sacramento, the state legislature (and legislatures up north in the Pacific Northwest) were passing bill after bill, including Phil Ting&#8217;s AB 68 and Bob Wieckowski&#8217;s SB 1069, to make it really easy to add backyard units,&#8221; Cutler wrote. &#8220;This is the kind of change that suburban America wants, is comfortable with and can politically pass and implement easily.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To Cutler&#8217;s thinking, Abodu&#8217;s 30 day construction schedule will change consumer behavior, thanks to the fact that the home can be craned in and installed in less than a day on a foundation constructed in less than two weeks. Its incredibly low cost will enable a lot of opportunities to develop new inventory and the simple fact is that inventory remains a scarce commodity. As Cutler noted, only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/upshot/where-have-all-the-houses-gone.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half as many homes are trading across the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as were available a year ago, which is happening at the same time as when millennials are entering prime family formation years. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Organizations spend ungodly amounts of money — millions of dollars — on business intelligence (BI) tools. Yet, adoption rates are still <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3753469/survey-analysis-why-bi-and-analytics-adoption-remains-lo">below 30%</a>. Why is this the case? Because BI has failed businesses.</p>
<p>Logi Analytics’ <a href="https://go.logianalytics.com/report-hanover-2021-state-of-analytics.html?utm_medium=press-release&amp;utm_source=pr-newswire&amp;utm_campaign=hanover-1Q-why-users-demand-better">2021 State of Analytics: Why Users Demand Better</a> survey showed that knowledge workers spend more than five hours a day in analytics, and more than 99% consider analytics very to extremely valuable when making critical decisions. Unfortunately, many are dissatisfied with their current tools due to the loss of productivity, multiple “sources of truth,” and the lack of integration with their current tools and systems.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			A gap exists between the functionalities provided by current BI and data discovery tools and what users want and need.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I’ve spoken with many executives who wonder why BI continues to fail them, especially when data discovery tools like Qlik and Tableau have gained such momentum. The reality is, these tools are great for a very limited set of use cases among a limited audience of users — and the adoption rates reflect that reality.</p>
<p>Data discovery applications allow analysts to link with data sources and perform self-service analysis, but still come with major pitfalls. Lack of self-service customization, the inability to integrate into workflows with other applications, and an overall lack of flexibility seriously impacts the ability for most users (who aren’t data analysts) to derive meaningful information from these tools.</p>
<p>BI platforms and data discovery applications are supposed to launch insight into action, informing decisions at every level of the organization. But many are instead left with costly investments that actually create inefficiencies, hinder workflows and exclude the vast majority of employees who could benefit from those operational insights. Now that’s what I like to call a lack of ROI.</p>
<p>Business leaders across a variety of industries — including “legacy” sectors like manufacturing, healthcare and financial services — are demanding better and, in my opinion, they should have gotten it long ago.</p>
<p>It’s time to abandon BI — at least as we currently know it.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve learned over the years about why traditional BI platforms and newer tools like data discovery applications fail and what I’ve gathered from companies that moved away from them.</p>
<h2><strong>The inefficiency breakdown is killing your company</strong></h2>
<p>Traditional BI platforms and data discovery applications require users to exit their workflow to attempt data collection. And, as you can guess, stalling teams in the middle of their workflow creates massive inefficiencies. Instead of having the data you need to make a decision readily available to you, instead, you have to exit the application, enter another application, secure the data and then reenter the original application.</p>
<p>According to the 2021 State of Analytics report, 99% of knowledge workers had to spend additional time searching for information they couldn’t easily locate in their analytics solution.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook’s hardware strategy often looks pretty opaque from the outside. The company has done fairly well with Oculus sales amid pandemic demand. Even its Echo Show competitor Portal has seen a bump as people have been forced to socially distance. The company’s smartphone partnership with HTC, meanwhile, fell flat eight or so years back.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-plans-smartwatch-with-focus-on-messaging-health">reports surfaced</a> that the company was working on its own Apple Watch competitor. The smartwatch was said to have a health focus, running on an open-source version of Android. That, of course, would mark an interesting alternative from Google’s chosen wearOS.</p>
<p>This week, the company highlighted <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/inside-facebook-reality-labs-wrist-based-interaction-for-the-next-computing-platform/">another wrist-based wearable</a>. The specifics of the project don’t line up super closely with earlier reports, which could well mean two separate projects. Facebook is a big company, after all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTechAtFacebook%2Fvideos%2F1126949421469231%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This particular project out of Facebook Reality Labs is more focused on providing an alternative computer interface. Specifically, it seems in line with the company’s augmented reality efforts.</p>
<p>Per yesterday’s blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>A separate device you could store in your pocket like a phone or a game controller adds a layer of friction between you and your environment. As we explored the possibilities, placing an input device at the wrist became the clear answer. The wrist is a traditional place to wear a watch, meaning it could reasonably fit into everyday life and social contexts. It’s a comfortable location for all-day wear. It’s located right next to the primary instruments you use to interact with the world — your hands. This proximity would allow us to bring the rich control capabilities of your hands into AR, enabling intuitive, powerful and satisfying interaction.</p></blockquote>
<p>I will say that, based on the information presented, this seems more conceptual. As in, this could be the key to offering more seamless control for some future augmented reality system. And even still, it’s presented as a step on the way to a more deeply integrated human-computer solution. How deeply you want Facebook to integrate with your neurons is apparently a question we’re all going to have to ask ourselves in the not too distant future.</p>
<p><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTechAtFacebook%2Fvideos%2F1146186389155473%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This interface specifically is designed to use electromyography (EMG) sensors to interpret motor nerve signals and interact with the interface accordingly. The subject interestingly came up <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel">during a Clubhouse event</a> featuring Mark Zuckerberg last night. After Pebble founder/YC partner Eric Migicovsky discussed experiences dealing with Apple for his own smartwatch startup, the Facebook CEO said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re trying to build a watch, which we&#8217;re exploring as we talked about the wrist thing and I don&#8217;t want to call it a watch, but it&#8217;s the basic neural interfaces work that our Facebook reality labs team demoed some of our research about today. With the neural interface on the wrist, if you want that to integrate with the phone in any way, it&#8217;s just so much easier on Android than iOS. My guess is that this is an area where there probably should be a lot more focus. And I do think the private APIs are just something that makes it really difficult to have a healthy ecosystem.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Exploring” seems like an operative word here. But it’s always cool/fascinating to see these projects in their early stages. Even if the promises might still seem a tad…overzealous.</p>
<p>EMG will eventually progress to richer controls. In AR, you’ll be able to actually touch and move virtual UIs and objects, as you can see in this demo video. You’ll also be able to control virtual objects at a distance. It’s sort of like having a superpower like the Force.</p>
