										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Conventional wisdom holds that one ought let sleeping does lie. But no one says you&#8217;re barred from tracking them while they do. New York-based smart collar maker Fi announced today that it’s adding sleep to the list of the device’s tracking.</p>
<p>The added feature uses the collar’s on-board motion sensing to monitor your best friend’s sleep during the day and night (and almost certainly leave you jealous about how much shut-eye they’re getting).</p>
<p>The information is presented on a timeline that should look familiar to anyone who has used the human equivalent. It also offers a live check-in to see what the dog is up to during the day while you’re at work (assuming you ever go back to the office).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180800" style="width: 722px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180800" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180800" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png" alt="" width="712" height="350" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png 712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180800" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fi</p></div></p>
<p>The goal here is to offer up some sharable metrics about your pet that might point to underlying health problems, be it too much sleep, not enough or frequent trips to the water bowl in the middle of the night. Sudden changes also present potential red flags for the dog’s health.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to move into holistic health tracking that empowers dog parents to take the best possible care of their pets,” founder and CEO Jonathan Bensamoun said in a release. “If your dog is tired, it can’t tell you, so Fi will. Fi can answer critical questions like, ‘Is my pet sleeping the right way?’ or ‘Did its activity levels decrease lately?’ long before more serious issues have time to develop.”</p>
<p>Fi raised $30 million back in February and is working to grow its reach in the U.S., including a recent distribution deal with mega-online pet supply seller, Chewy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you can&#8217;t say it with words, say it with an emoji. Facebook is announcing a few minor updates today to its Messenger platform, which make it easier than ever to find the exact emoji you&#8217;re looking for when reacting to a friend&#8217;s message (let&#8217;s be real, there&#8217;s a big difference between the &#8220;crying laughing&#8221; and &#8220;crying&#8221; emoji). This includes a search bar for emoji reactions, and a recently used emojis section. And, if you weren&#8217;t let down by the long-awaited &#8220;Space Jam&#8221; sequel, you can sport your love for hoopster Bugs Bunny with a &#8220;Space Jam 2&#8221; chat theme, available both on Messenger and in Instagram DMs. Don&#8217;t get too excited though &#8212; even though this theme sets a basketball as the chat&#8217;s emoji, the long lost, beloved <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/18/facebook-sneaked-a-seriously-addictive-basketball-game-into-messenger/">basketball mini game</a> has not yet made its triumphant return to the Messenger app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180580" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180580" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2180580" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180580" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook Messenger</p></div></p>
<p>It may not feel like there&#8217;s room for innovation in, um, the emoji space, but even Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/">explored the option</a> of allowing people to emoji-react to tweets. And as live audio has become ever present &#8212; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">Clubhouse</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">Twitter Spaces</a>, to Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a> &#8212; why not add audio to emojis?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, Messenger debuted Soundmojis, which are what they sound like &#8212; emojis with sounds. On the Messenger app, you can use Soundmojis by clicking the smiley face icon in the chat box, which opens up the expressions menu. When you select the loudspeaker icon, you can select from just under 30 standard emojis, but when you click on them, they play sounds including &#8220;Brooklyn 99&#8221; quotes, Olivia Rodrigo clips, and lines from &#8220;Bridgerton.&#8221; The &#8220;X&#8221; emoji plays &#8220;Oh No&#8221; by Capone, a song that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/capone-oh-no-tiktok-trend">went viral</a> on TikTok.</p>
<p>According to Facebook Messenger, people send more than 2.4 billion messages with emojis on the platform each day. That&#8217;s great and all, but if we can tap the car emoji to hear sounds from &#8220;Fast &amp; Furious,&#8221; when will we be able to tap the soccer emoji to play &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/how-to-play-facebook-messengers-new-super-addictive-and-hidden-soccer-game/">keepie uppie</a>&#8221; again?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Magic, a San Francisco-based startup that builds &#8220;plug and play&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/how-startups-can-go-passwordless-thanks-to-zero-trust/">passwordless</a> authentication technology, has raised $27 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The round, led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/northzone/">Northzone</a> and with participation from Tiger Global, Volt Capital, Digital Currency Group and CoinFund, comes just over a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/decentralized-identity-management-platform-magic-launches-from-stealth-with-4m/">Magic launched from stealth</a>, rebranding from its previous name Formatic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The company, like many others, is on a mission to end traditional password-based authentication. Magic’s flagship SDK, which launched in April 2020, enables developers to implement a variety of passwordless authentication methods with just a few lines of code and integrates with a number of modern frameworks and infrastructures.</p>
<p>Not only does the SDK make it easier for companies and developers to implement passwordless auth methods in their applications, but it could also help to mitigate the expensive fallout that many have to deal with as a result of data breaches.</p>
<p>“This is why the password is so dangerous,&#8221; Sean Li, Magic co-founder and CEO tells TechCrunch. &#8220;It’s like a Jenga tower right now — a hacker breaching your system can download an entire database of encrypted passwords, and then easily crack them. It’s a huge central point of failure.”</p>
<p>The company recently built out its SDK to add support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/fido-alliance-and-w3c-have-a-plan-to-kill-the-password/">WebAuthn</a>, which means it can support hardware-based authentication keys like Yubico, as well as biometric-based Face ID and fingerprint logins on mobile devices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It’s less mainstream right now, but we’re making it super simple for developers,” says Li. “This way we can help promote new technologies, and that’s really good for user security and privacy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bet that seems to be working: Magic has recorded a 13% month-over-month increase in developer signups, and the number of identities secured is growing at a rate of 6% weekly, according to Magic. It’s also secured a number of big-name customers, from crypto news publisher Decrypt to fundraising platform Fairmint.</p>
<p>Wendy Xiao Schadeck, a partner at Northzone said: “We couldn&#8217;t be more excited to support Sean and the Magic team as they redefine authentication for the internet from the bottom up, solving a core pain point for developers, users, and companies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It was clear to us that they&#8217;re absolutely loved by their customers because the team is so obsessed with serving every single part of the developer journey across several communities. What&#8217;s potentially even more exciting is what they will be able to do to empower users and decentralize the identity layer of the web.”</p>
<p>The company now plans to continue to scale its platform and expand its team to meet what Magic describes as “soaring” demand. The startup, which currently has 30 employees that work remotely on a full-time basis, expects to at least double its headcount across all core functions, including product, engineering, design, marketing, finance, people, and operations.</p>
<p>It’s also planning to hope to build out the SDK even further; Li says he wants to be able to plug into more kinds of technology, from low-code applications to workflow automations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The vision is much bigger than that. We want to be the passport of the internet,” Li adds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.indexventures.com/">Index Ventures</a> has closed a trio of new funds: a $900 million early-stage fund, a $2 billion growth-stage fund and a previously announced $200 million seed-stage fund. The close gives Index $3 billion in new capital, its largest tranche yet, to deploy into emerging startups and existing portfolio companies, which include the likes of Plaid, Deliveroo and Revolut, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/">just valued at $33 billion.</a></p>
<p>Index’s new capital comes a little over a year since it closed its last funds, which were a duet of $1.2 billion for growth-stage investments and $800 million for early-stage investments. It also is announced while venture dollars more broadly seem to be growing at an unprecedented rate &#8212; In recent weeks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/accel-closes-on-3b-across-three-funds/">Accel announced that it has closed $3 billion across three funds, too</a>, and Andreessen Horowitz landed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">$2.2 billion fund dedicated entirely to crypto startups.</a></p>
<p>The influx of money means that check sizes and valuations are growing across the entire ecosystem. Index, for example, said that it has grown its Series A check size from $10 million to $15 million, while it increased its growth check from $35 million to $50 million. Its check size in the United States is about 20% higher compared to its check size in Europe, meaning that the former represents between 55% to 60% of the firm’s total investing dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Index’s check size is growing slightly bigger to keep up with competition, partner Mark Goldberg said that the firm is staying disciplined so it doesn’t fall prey to FOMO rounds or buzzy valuations.</p>
<p>“There have been situations where two years ago, I would have engaged,” in a competition for a late-stage round, he said. “And now I say that we probably are not going to compete … because at the heart of the matter, I think capital is a commodity.” The partner didn’t point to Accel’s $3 billion close, but instead noted how “Tiger Global and other crossover funds” have created a new capital product, which means that Index’s ability to compete must look different than just offering a ton of money.</p>
<p>“If you’re just looking for capital, we’re probably not going to be the best product for you,” Goldberg added.</p>
<p>Index Partner Martin Mignot thinks that a &#8220;bifurcation is really happening&#8221; in the fundraising market, where some founders are able to raise easily, but many continue to struggle if they&#8217;re not &#8220;at the right sector in the right place at the right time.&#8221; Mignot has been spending time looking at Africa as a potential investment area that continues to be underresourced. He hinted that an official initiative focused on Africa startups may be underway.</p>
<p>The firm said it has &#8220;several initiatives in place related to diversity including increasing the number of individuals on our investment from underrepresented groups and diversifying our investment funnel&#8221; but said that it does not track diversity statistics at a portfolio company level &#8220;yet.&#8221; Index said that its investment team is composed of 38% of individuals who identify as female and 14% of individuals who come from underrepresented groups, although its unclear whether they have check-writing power.</p>

<p>Index appears to be going through a period of experimentation when it comes to the services offered to portfolio companies. While the firm declined to give too many specifics on upcoming initiatives around diversity or more generally, it did note its growing TikTok presence as part of its strategy.</p>
<p>The Index Ventures TikTok has over 28,000 followers. Its most viewed video is about Costco’s business model, with 4.8 million views followed by an interview clip from Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, with 315,000 views.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not something where I think the next deal comes from the TikTok account, but it&#8217;s one of those initiatives where … I think it will pay dividends” in helping Index reach a younger audience that isn’t active on tech Twitter or Clubhouse. Index’s TikTok, led by Rex Woodbury, is reminiscent of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/banana-capitals-fund-1-turner-novak/">how some emerging fund managers</a> are approaching creative deal flow.</p>
<p>The firm is also experimenting with incubating startups in-house, which has historically never been a major focus. <a href="https://twitter.com/Mark_Goldberg_/status/1415715109507190790">A tweet suggests</a> that Index is actively recruiting entrepreneurs to join the incubator, which could be divided thematically. Goldberg declined to give more specifics around how incubation programs are structured and what the terms are, saying that the Index Incubator is not an official product yet.</p>
<p>That said, one can only imagine that a firm freshly capitalized with billions of dollars probably has some money to spare — from incubated projects to those growth-stage companies in need of active investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Obé Fitness’ co-founders/co-CEOs Mark Mullett and Ashley Mills toss around the word “entertrainment” a lot. For the record, it’s not a reference to the Butler County, Ohio-based amusement park that serves as the home of the “world’s largest train display,” but rather one of those industry portmanteaus like <em>infotainment</em> or <em>webinar.</em></p>
<p>Here it’s meant to be a reference to what the New York-based company sees as its principle differentiator from an increasingly crowded market. Mills describes it as “where entertainment and fitness meet. Talent is key to that. Not also being able to cast talent that can deliver a great workout, but they also have that X Factor. They have the ability to reach across the screen and make you feel something at home.”</p>
<p>The company has been building up an audience of influencers as well, including Kelly Ripa, Kate Hudson and Tiffany Haddish, the latter of whom participated in the $15 million Series A the company is announcing today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The capital is really about team growth and awareness in a couple of key business development initiatives,&#8221; says Mullett. &#8220;In the current climate, where everyone is talking about their various home workouts, you definitely need resources to grow. So this round is about getting Obé in front of as many people as possible.”</p>
<p>The round was led by CAVU Venture Partners and features Athleta, Samsung Next, Wheelhouse Entertainment and WW International, Inc., along with previous investors Cassius Ventures, Ludlow Ventures, Harris Blitzer Sports Entertainment and BDMI.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180364" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180364" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180364" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Obé</p></div></p>
<p>It’s a pretty diverse list of parties with a diverse list of interests in the platform &#8212; take Samsung, which currently offers the Obé platform on its smart TVs. Users can also access it on iOS and Android devices and cast it accordingly to their TV sets.</p>
<p>Obé (pronounced “Obey”) bills itself as a “premium” service. At $27, it’s certainly at the higher end, verses offerings like the $10/month Apple Fitness+ or Peleton’s $13 monthly fee. Unlike Peloton, which has proprietary equipment attached, Obé actually skipped the equipment altogether at launch, though it has slowly expanded its offerings to include things like free weights and trampolines for its bounce classes &#8212; equipment that’s a bit more forgiving in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, the company saw a large increase in users during the pandemic. While Obé doesn’t disclose subscriber counts, its founders told me the platform’s userbase increased 4x last year.</p>
<p>“We started this company three and a half years ago,” says Mullett. “When COVID hit in March of 2020, our team, our talent, our interface &#8212; everyone was ready to receive the rush of new users who needed to be sated by movement and by someone who could keep them inspired, sane and confident during a difficult time.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The world of venture capital investing is a relatively small one, and family offices and accredited investors are eager to get involved, but find it difficult to access fund managers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of venture capital investing is a relatively small one, and relationship-based to boot. Family offices and accredited investors are eager to get involved in high-quality funds, but face hurdles like access to fund managers.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://allocate.co/">Allocate</a>. The company, founded by Samir Kaji and Hana Yang in February 2021, is developing an approach to venture capital fund investing that provides a way for investors of any size to participate.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the San Francisco-based company announced it raised $5 million in seed funding from a group of backers including Urban Innovation Fund, Tusk Venture Partners, Basis Set Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, Fika Ventures, Ulu Ventures and Anthemis Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pair met as Kauffman Fellows, both with backgrounds in financial services. By the time they met, Yang was working in the nonprofit world, and said they began talking about the friction between the nonprofit and venture capital worlds. Then Yang joined Kaji at First Republic Bank to work together and continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Kaji, <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/global-asset-management-industry-report">citing a Boston Consulting Group report</a>, estimated there are between 8,000 and 11,000 global family offices and nearly 17 million accredited investors that currently control some $42 trillion in assets.</p>
<p>They saw the issue as it related to supply and demand: On the supply side, there are a finite number of institutional investors, “all with their dance cards full,” Kaji told TechCrunch. Fund managers want to get at that nontraditional endowment money and are looking at family offices, but finding those individuals is a challenge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the demand side, family offices have trouble accessing venture capital firms — they don’t know where to look to find managers, don’t have time to cultivate those relationships or can’t make the traditional $1 million commitments.</p>
<p>As a result, Kaji and Yang decided to start Allocate as a way to usher in the next era of venture capital by creating a way for retail investors of any size or background to invest in funds and for managers to find family offices.</p>
<p>Allocate&#8217;s platform curates venture fund products for wealth advisors, family offices and qualified individual investors based on their investment objectives, and any pre- and post-investment transactions and reporting activities are completed on the platform.</p>
<p>The company sets up its own feeder vehicles that aggregate investor capital so that there are lower minimum investments and that capital can easily be managed by fund managers. It then charges a fee, on an annual basis, on investments made.</p>
<p>Currently, investors can choose the funds they want to invest in, but Kaji said Allocate will eventually also offer products that will be like funds of funds, where investments go into a pot that will be invested by a fund manager.</p>
<p>The company is pre-revenue and said it will use the new funding to build out its product and make some key hires over the next year as it gears up for a formal software product launch at the end of the year. It is already attracting a waitlist of several hundred fund managers and investors.</p>
<p>“With the market the way it is, the number of accredited investors is expected to grow by 50% by 2025,” Kaji said. “There is a huge opportunity to unlock the market and have people participate.”</p>
<p>Jordan Nof, co-founder and managing partner at Tusk Ventures, agrees. He sees a lot of economic growth taking place outside the public market, and opportunities present themselves for someone to capitalize on.</p>
<p>Due to the access issue between fund managers and potential investors, there are trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines, he told TechCrunch. With Allocate, Nof saw a way to bridge the two parties with tools for both sides to make sound decisions and further evolve venture capital.</p>
<p>“I have known Samir for quite some time, and he and his team understand this problem set and they have a vision of what the venture capital future looks like,” he added. “This is a cottage industry even though VC is responsible for impacting the largest of technology companies, which have taken VC, yet it is a still super fragmented industry that has no transparency. Allocate is the next transition of a true platform that enables family offices and high-net worth individuals access.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year and a half after <a href="https://www.currencycloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Currencycloud</a> raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/26/currencycloud-nabs-80m-from-visa-world-bank-group-and-more-for-its-cross-border-payments-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 million in a round that included Visa</a>, the London-based developer of APIs that powered remittance and currency exchange services is getting even closer to the financial services giant. Today, <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.18161.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visa announced</a> that it would acquire CurrencyCloud in a deal valued at $963 million (£700 million).</p>
<p>This price is a very decent leap from that last funding round, when sources told us the startup was valued at around $500 million.</p>
<p>(As Visa already has equity in the company, the amount it will actually pay will be reduced by that amount.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CurrencyCloud has some 500 customers in 180 countries that use its APIs to power multi-currency wallets, currency exchange services, and account management, including some of the biggest startups around such as Monzo, Moneze, Starling, Revolut and Dwolla. These will continue, and on top of that Visa will use the startup&#8217;s technology to bolster its own currency exchange rails to provide a wider set of services to its own customers, which include financial institutions, fintechs and more, as well as to build new services for consumers as well.</p>
<p>“At Currencycloud, we’ve always strived to deliver a better tomorrow for all, from the smallest start-up to the global multi-nationals. Re-imagining how money flows around the global economy just got more exciting as we join Visa,” said Mike Laven, CEO, Currencycloud, in a statement. “The combination of Currencycloud’s fintech expertise and Visa’s network will enable us to deliver greater customer value to the businesses moving money across borders.”</p>
<p>Remittance and currency transfers to be big business in the world of financial services, and that opportunity is growing. Two of the factors driving this are that e-commerce has extended well outside of our national borders, especially in the past 18 months, and so have supply chains. (Visa notes that some 43% of all small businesses globally carried out some form of international trade in 2020.) And with the rise of cloud-based, mobile services to facilitate transactions, consumers are ever more globalised in their outlooks, too.</p>
<p>At the same time, remittances and currency transfers are two areas ripe for disruption, with incumbent services often costly and inefficient. All of this sets the stage for a company like CurrencyCloud, which has built a new implementation of currency transfer that can be embedded into other financial services to help them run more smoothly.</p>
<p>The exit is also a classic example of how larger, incumbent financial powerhouses typically find it harder to innovate and jump into new services, so instead they tap smaller and more agile startups that are taking big bets on technology, and pulling it off, to help propel themselves into the next generation of financial services. Whether Visa will be able to successfully integrate and use CurrencyCloud&#8217;s tech and work with its team are two things that were already tested out: the two were strategic partners prior to this deal.</p>
<p>“The acquisition of Currencycloud is another example of Visa executing on our network of networks strategy to facilitate global money movement,” said<strong> </strong>Colleen Ostrowski, Visa’s Global Treasurer, in a statement. “Consumers and businesses increasingly expect transparency, speed and simplicity when making or receiving international payments. With our acquisition of Currencycloud, we can support our clients and partners to further reduce the pain points of cross-border payments and develop great user experiences for their customers.”<strong> </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://tailorbrands.com/">Tailor Brands</a>, a startup that automates parts of the branding and marketing process for small businesses, announced Thursday it has raised $50 million in Series C funding.</p>
<p>GoDaddy led the round as a strategic partner and was joined by OurCrowd and existing investors Pitango Growth, Mangrove Capital Partners, Armat Group, Disruptive VC and Whip Media founder Richard Rosenblatt. Tailor Brands has now raised a total of $70 million since its inception in 2015.</p>
<p>“GoDaddy is empowering everyday entrepreneurs around the world by providing all of the help and tools to succeed online,” said Andrew Morbitzer, vice president of corporate development at GoDaddy, in a written statement. “We are excited to invest in Tailor Brands — and its team — as we believe in their vision. Their platform truly helps entrepreneurs start their business quickly and easily with AI-powered logo design and branding services.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When Tailor Brands, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/tailor-brands-aims-to-bring-small-business-owners-affordable-access-to-professional-design/">launched at TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield in 2014</a>, raised its last round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/tailor-brands-series-b/">$15.5 million Series B</a>, in 2018, the company was focused on AI-driven logo creation.</p>
<p>The company, headquartered in New York and Tel Aviv, is now compiling the components for a one-stop SaaS platform — providing the design, branding and marketing services a small business owner needs to launch and scale operations, and within minutes, Yali Saar, co-founder and CEO of Tailor Brands told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Over the past year, more users are flocking to Tailor Brands; the company is onboarding some 700,000 new users per month for help in the earliest stages of setting up their business. In fact, the company saw a 27% increase in new business incorporations as the creator and gig economy gained traction in 2020, Saar said.</p>
<p>In addition to the scores of new users, the company crossed 30 million businesses using the platform. At the end of 2019, Tailor Brands started monetizing its offerings and “grew at a staggering rate,” Saar added. The company yielded triple-digit annual growth in revenue.</p>
<p>To support that growth, the new funding will be used on R&amp;D, to double the team and create additional capabilities and functions. There may also be future acquisition opportunities on the table.</p>
<p>Saar said Tailor Brands is at a point where it can begin leveraging the massive amount of data on small businesses it gathers to help them be proactive rather than reactive, turning the platform into a “consultant of sorts” to guide customers through the next steps of their businesses.</p>
<p>“Users are looking for us to provide them with everything, so we are starting to incorporate more products with the goal of creating an ecosystem, like WeChat, where you don’t need to leave the platform at all to manage your business,” Saar said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sorry Mr. Putin, but there’s a race on for Russian and Eastern European founders. And right now, those awful capitalists in the corrupt West are starting to out-gun the opposition! But seriously… only the other day a $100 million fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/100-million-leta-capital-wants-to-be-a-friend-to-russia-speaking-founders-everywhere/">aimed at Russian speaking entrepreneurs</a> appeared, and others are proliferating.</p>
<p>Now, London-based <a href="https://www.theuntitled.vc">Untitled Ventures</a> plans to join their fray with a €100 million / $118M for its <em>second</em> fund to invest in “ambitious deep tech startups with eastern European founders.”</p>
<p>Untitled says it is aiming at entrepreneurs who are looking to relocate their business or have already HQ’ed in Western Europe and the USA. That’s alongside all the other existing Western VCs who are &#8211; in my experience &#8211; always ready and willing to listen to Russian and Eastern European founders, who are often known for their technical prowess.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Untitled is going to be aiming at B2B, AI, agritech, medtech, robotics, and data management startups with proven traction emerging from the Baltics, CEE, and CIS, or those already established in Western Europe</p>
<p>LPs in the fund include Vladimir Vedeenev, a founder of Global Network Management&gt;. Untitled also claims to have Google, Telegram Messenger, Facebook, Twitch, DigitalOcean, IP-Only, CenturyLinks, Vodafone and TelecomItaly as partners.</p>
<p>Oskar Stachowiak, Untitled Ventures Managing Partner, said: “With over 10 unicorns, €1Bn venture funding in 2020 alone, and success stories like Veeam, Semrush, and Wrike, startups emerging from the fast-growing regions are the best choice to focus on early-stage investment for us. Thanks to the strong STEM focus in the education system and about one million high-skilled developers, we have an ample opportunity to find and support the rising stars in the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Konstantin Siniushin, the Untitled Ventures MP said: &#8220;We believe in economic efficiency and at the same time we fulfill a social mission of bringing technological projects with a large scientific component from the economically unstable countries of the former USSR, such as, first of all, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, but not only in terms of bringing sales to the world market and not only helping them to HQ in Europe so they can get next rounds of investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: “We have a great experience accumulated earlier in the first portfolio of the first fund, not just structuring business in such European countries as, for example, Luxembourg, Germany, Great Britain, Portugal, Cyprus and Latvia, but also physically relocating startup teams so that they are perceived already as fully resident in Europe and globally.”</p>
<p>To be fair, it is still harder than it needs to be to create large startups from Eastern Europe, mainly because there is often very little local capital. However, that is changing, with the launch recently of CEE funds such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/vitosha-venture-partners-launches-30m-fund-to-back-bulgarian-related-early-stage-startups/">Vitosha Venture Partners</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/launchub-ventures-heading-towards-a-85m-fund-for-south-eastern-european-startups/">Launchub Ventures</a>, and the breakout hit from Romania that was UIPath.</p>
<p><strong>The Untitled Ventures team:</strong><br />
• Konstantin Siniushin, a serial tech entrepreneur<br />
• Oskar Stachowiak, experienced fund manager<br />
• Mary Glazkova, PR &amp; Comms veteran<br />
• Anton Antich, early stage investor and an ex VP of Veeam, a Swiss cloud data management company<br />
acquired by Insight Venture Partners for $5bln<br />
• Yulia Druzhnikova, experienced in taking tech companies international<br />
• Mark Cowley, who has worked on private and listed investments within CEE/Russia for over 20 years</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Slack set the standard in many ways for what knowledge workers want and expect out of a workplace collaboration app these days, but a lot has been left on the table when it comes to frontline workers. Today, one of the software companies that has built a popular app for that frontline crowd to become a part of the conversation is announcing a funding round that speaks to the opportunity to do more.</p>
<p><a href="https://yoobic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoobic</a>, which provides an app for frontline and service workers to manage tasks, communicate with each other and management, and also go through training, development and and other e-learning tasks, has picked up $50 million.</p>
<p>Highland Europe led the round, a Series C, with previous investors Felix Capital, Insight Partners, and a family office advised by BNF Capital Limited also participating. (Felix led Yoobic&#8217;s Series A, while Insight Partners led the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/yoobic-retail-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B in 2019</a>.) Yoobic is not discussing valuation but from what I understand from a reliable source, it is now between $300 million and $400 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes at a time of strong growth for the company.</p>
<p>Yoobic works with some 300 big brands in 80 countries altogether covering a mammoth 335,000 locations in sectors like retail, hospitality, distribution and manufacturing. Its customers include the likes of the Boots pharmacy chain, Carrefour supermarkets, Lancôme, Lacoste, Logitech, Lidl, Peloton, Puma, Vans, VF Corp, Sanofi, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Untuckit, Roots, Canada Goose, Longchamp, Lidl, Zadig &amp; Voltaire, and Athletico.</span></p>
<p>But that is just the tip of the iceberg. It&#8217;s <a href="http://desklessworkforce2018.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that there are 2.7 billion &#8220;deskless&#8221; (frontline and service) workers globally, accounting for no less than 80% of the world&#8217;s workforce. But here is the shocker: only 1% of IT budgets is currently spent on them. That speaks of huge opportunity for startups to build more here, but only if they (or the workers themselves( can manage to convince those holding the purse strings that it&#8217;s worth the investment.</p>
<p>So to that end, the funding will be used to hire more talent, to expand geographically &#8212; founded in London, the company is now headquartered in New York &#8212; and to expand its product. Specifically, Yoobic plans to build more predictive analytics to improve responsiveness and give more insight to companies about their usage, and to build out more tools to cater to specific verticals in the world of frontline work, such as manufacturing, logistics and transportation, Fabrice Haiat, CEO and co-founder of YOOBIC, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Yoobic started life several years ago with a focus specifically on retail &#8212; an area that it was concentrating on as recently as its last round in 2019, providing tools to help with merchandizing, communicating about stock between stores and more. While retail is still a sizeable part of its business, Yoobic saw an opening to expand into a wider pool of verticals with frontline and service employees that had many of the same demands as retail.</p>
<p>That turned out to be a fortunate pivot as the pandemic struck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Covid-19 had a big impact on us,&#8221; said Haiat, who co-founded the company with brothers Avi and Gilles. &#8220;The first two months we were in panic mode. But what happened was that businesses realized that frontline employees were critical to the success of their operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Covid hit last year, he said that activity on the platform rose by 200%, and earlier this year it passed 1 million activities per month on its platform. &#8220;We are growing like crazy,&#8221; Haiat said.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why building for frontline workers is important. Roaming round without a fixed desk, spending more time with customers than looking at a screen or in meetings, and generally having different business priorities and practices are just a few of the reasons why software built for the former doesn&#8217;t necessarily work for the latter.</p>
<p>There have been a number of companies that have aimed to build services to address that gap &#8212; they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/29/ex-yammer-execs-raise-5-5m-for-cotap-a-mobile-messaging-app-aiming-to-be-whatsapp-for-the-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stretch back years</a>, in fact. And there have been some interesting moves to consolidate in the market among those building some of the more successful tools for people in the field: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/crew-a-workplace-and-slack-messaging-rival-for-shift-workers-raises-35m-adds-enterprise-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crew </a><a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-acquires-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently got acquired by Square</a>; <a href="https://www.servicemax.com/press-releases/servicemax-acquires-zinc-to-expand-service-execution-management-offering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ServiceMax acquired Zinc</a>; and Facebook&#8217;s Workplace has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/workplace-facebooks-enterprise-edition-snaps-up-walmart-as-a-customer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been on a march</a> to amass some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies as customers of its own communications platform with a strong play for frontline workers.</p>
<p>Haiat argues that while all of these are fine and well, none of them understand the full scope of the kinds of tools that those in the field really need. That ranges from practical features (such as a way to handle inventory management), through to features that companies would love to have for their employees as long as they can be delivered in an easy way (such as professional development and training). In that context, the basic communications that all of the current crop of apps for frontline workers offer feel like basic tablestakes.</p>
<p>That close understanding of the gap in the market and what is needed to fix it is one reason why the company has seen such strong growth, as well as interest from investors.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with YOOBIC, which, thanks to the highly impressive team led by Fabrice, Avi and Gilles, has clearly established itself as a leader in the digital workplace space with demonstrable market traction and impressive growth.” said Jean Tardy-Joubert, partner at Highland Europe, in a statement. “While companies have historically focused on digital investments for deskbound employees, the world is becoming distributed and decentralized.  We anticipate a seismic shift that will see huge resources, technology, and capital shifted toward frontline teams.” Tardy-Joubert will be joining the YOOBIC Board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic forcing people online, social media use exploded, for obvious reasons. And with that, the opportunity to reach audiences and push messaging. More brand-oriented platforms such as Sprinkler, Sprout Social, and Hootsuite have obviously risen in use, but so did traffic to Oktopost, a much more B2B-oriented proposition.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Oktopost has only ever registered an $800,000 early stage funding, and has run on revenues and profit ever since. Today that changes with a growth funding round of a $20 million minority investment from London-based growth equity firm Expedition Growth Capital.</p>
<p>Oktopost’s schtick is that it is an enterprise-grade platform for B2B marketers to curate content, organize, and manage campaigns for corporate social media accounts, employee advocacy and social selling. It can also handle social listening and analytics. It also boasts native integrations with Adobe’s Marketo, Salesforce’s Pardot, Hubspot; and CRM systems such as Salesforce, and Microsoft Dynamics. Oktopost’s customer include Fujitsu, Mitsubishi Electric, Xerox, SWIFT, ACI Worldwide, ContentSquare, ChargeBee and SUSE.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The above functions have hoved into view with far greater importance as social media users upped their interactions online, and companies needed to, to put it mildly, get their act together asocial media ‘ate the world’ in the last 16 months.</p>
<p>Oktopost says it plans to use the funding to advance its product roadmap, boost customer success, accelerate marketing and sales, and explore strategic acquisitions; and grow its workforce by 50%.<br />
 <br />
Daniel Kushner, co-founder and CEO of Oktopost, said: &#8220;Our mission from day one was to establish the first ever B2B social media marketing platform with the ability to measure and quantify the value of social media in terms of lead generation, pipeline influence, customer acquisition, and ultimately ROI… As siloes breakdown between marketing and sales within B2B companies, and as social selling becomes more widespread, we believe Oktopost is uniquely suited to provide the functionality desired.”<br />
 <br />
Oliver Thomas, Managing Partner at Expedition Growth Capital said: “There are a number of social media tools out there catering for B2C companies but we haven’t seen a platform that is specifically tailored to the B2B journey until Oktopost. The ability to manage, track and analyse social activities is increasingly a must-have for B2B sales and marketing organisations. Daniel and Liad have built the best product in the market to serve this need. They have also built a terrific culture and we’re excited to be part of the journey from here.”</p>
<p>Speaking to Kushner I asked him what effect the pandemic had had on the business.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s gone bananas,” he said “Our focus is 100% on B2B organisations. Our platform is divided into corporate social media, so Twitter, LinkedIn company pages, etc. The second is what we call employee advocacy social, where you want your employees to be a part of the corporate brand, with employees sharing on a personal LinkedIn, Twitter accounts, social messages.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that this ecosystem &#8211; the platform to support both corporate social and employee advocacy &#8211; means they can prove return on investment for customers: &#8220;What are they getting from doing all this social? The platform is designed to provide those kind of metrics to show the real business impact of social, the real impact that it has on the business. And not just fluff metrics that you normally get on social.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s trucking system has a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d529d48c-dc1b-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482">big inefficiency problem</a> that continues to drag the economy. BlackBuck, one of the handful of startups that is digitizing the freight and logistics across India, has just attained the unicorn status after securing new funds.</p>
<p>Tribe Capital, IFC Emerging Asia Fund and VEF led the $67 million Series E financing round in the six-year-old startup, valuing it at $1.02 billion (up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/indias-blackbuck-raises-150-million-to-digitize-freight-and-logistics-across-india/">about $850 million in 2019 Series D round</a>), BlackBuck chief executive Rajesh Yabaji told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this week. BlackBuck is the 16th Indian startup to become a unicorn this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blackbuck.com">BlackBuck</a> connects businesses with truck owners and freight operators. The startup has developed a simplified app for truck drivers in India, who are typically not very literate, to help them accept work and easily navigate to their destination using Google Maps. On the client side, businesses can fire up a similar app to place orders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>About 700,000 truckers and 1.2 million trucks in India today are connected to the platform, which sees over 15 million transactions each month. &#8220;India&#8217;s truckers did not go truly digital till 2019. Since then, the supply activity has gone up by 20 times,&#8221; said Yabaji.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started BlackBuck in 2015, only 40% of truck owners had smartphones and for truck drivers, that adoption was just 7%. By 2019, 100% of truck owners and 70% of truck drivers had smartphones,&#8221; he said, attributing this growth to advent of low-cost Android smartphones and access to much more affordable mobile data (thanks to Jio Platforms).</p>
<p>&#8220;On top of this, the government started pushing the digital adoption. There&#8217;s a digital toll system now, and many state governments have made GPS mandatory,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>During this period, BlackBuck, too, has transformed considerably. The platform has moved away from relying on call centres for booking orders to an app-based system. Today, Yabaji said the startup has reduced its reliance on brokers, who help connect them to truckers in smaller regions as more truckers and fleet owners now have smartphones and book directly.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the supply side, the platform was built in a way that it was agnostic to who was ordering. Anyone who has access to capacity in a particular location and at a particular time, has access to the load. On principal, we were okay with it from day 1,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;As we speak today, 95% of the load acceptance happens by small fleet owners who own two to three trucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>For BlackBuck, another challenge has been making inroads with small and medium-sized businesses. The platform&#8217;s biggest customerbase has traditionally comprised of large enterprises. Yabaji said things have changed dramatically as the biggest growth that BlackBuck has seen in recent years has come from SMEs. In total, the startup has over 10,000 customers SME and enterprise customers now including giants such as Hindustan Unilever, Reliance, Coca Cola, Asian Paints, Tata, Vedanta, L&amp;T and Jindal.</p>
<p>One of the biggest successes of BlackBuck in recent years has been the growth of its FASTag offering. (FASTag is an electronic toll collection system in India to make toll payments directly from the prepaid or savings account linked to it or directly to the toll owner.) Yabaji said 35% of India&#8217;s trucking toll spend today happens through BlackBuck.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are the leaders in this category and have built several unique solutions for Indian truckers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;India&#8217;s supply chain and logistics industry is moving from paper and pencil to digital,&#8221; said Arjun Sethi, cofounder and partner at Tribe Capital, in a statement. &#8220;BlackBuck’s ability to measure output and productivity growth has streamlined logistical challenges for the industry over a short time frame. Its continued high velocity growth promises to bring even greater transformation to the Indian trucking ecosystem.”  (On a side note, Tribe Capital is in talks to back at least two more Indian startups, according to people with knowledge of the matter.)</p>
<p>BlackBuck will deploy the fresh funds to deepen its presence across India and launch several new features on its marketplace, said Yabaji. BlackBuck also has presence in Europe. Yabaji said the startup&#8217;s international play is still in its pilot stage and the large focus currently remains on India.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the midst of the Covid pandemic Blackbuck has scaled its online freight marketplace and fleet management services rapidly. Blackbuck’s contribution to increased transparency and efficiency in the large, fragmented and predominantly unorganized long-haul freight market in India offers the potential for significant developmental impact,&#8221; said Saadia Khairi, fund head at IFC Emerging Asia Fund, in a statement.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. BlackBuck is the 16th Indian startup to become a unicorn this year, compared to 11 last year and six in 2019.</p>

<p><a href="https://gudangada.com/en">GudangAda</a>, a Jakarta-based marketplace that brings wholesalers closer to retail stores and other buyers, announced it has closed a Series B of more than $100 million. The company says the round was oversubscribed, passing its initial target of $75 million. The funding was led by Asia Partners and Falcon Edge, with participation from Sequoia Capital India, Alpha JWC and Wavemaker Partners.</p>
<p>This brings GudangAda’s total raised so far to about $135 million. Its last funding was a <a href="https://www.alphajwc.com/en/gudangada-indonesias-largest-fmcg-b2b-marketplace-raises-a-us25-4-mn-series-a/">$25.4 million Series A last year</a>, led by Sequoia Capital India and Alpha JWC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in January 2019, GudangAda is now used by half a million SMEs and covers 500 cities in Indonesia. Before raising its Series B, it had already grown to $6 billion in net merchandise value on $35 million of funding. Principal manufacturers and distributors on the platform range include food products company Sido Muncul, seasoning maker Sasa and British multinational consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser.</p>
<p>Founder and chief executive officer Stevensang spent more than 25 years in Indonesia’s fast-moving consumer goods and retail industries before starting GudangAda. Over the past 10 years, Stevensang told TechCrunch that logistics costs in Indonesia have increased to among the highest in the world, impacting the whole supply chain, especially SME buyers.</p>
<p>GudangAda helps lower operational costs by connecting principal manufacturers, distributors and retailers, and handling almost all aspects of B2B buying, including deliveries. Its mobile app includes a point-of-sale system and it can also be used to manage orders, track logistics and make payments.</p>

<p>Stevensang said GudangAda focuses on several things to make buying inventory easier for SMEs. One is optimizing inventory turnover to increase working capital for businesses on the platform. The company also provides market research and data for products and gives retailers a large selection of goods. Being connected to multiple suppliers on the same platform also lets small retail stores that sell a large selection of items, but don’t have the buying volume to order directly from distributors, to purchase inventory at competitive costs.</p>
<p>To keep logistics costs down, GudangAda partners with third-party vehicle and warehouse providers to build its coverage throughout Indonesia. For its logistics partners, it provides transportation and warehouse management systems to help them digitize their operations.</p>
<p>In the future, GudangAda plans to partner with banks that will provide working capital for SMEs, enabling them to apply for loans using their data on the platform.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to expand GudangAda’s product categories, which now include fast-moving consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, packaging, homeware and stationery. It also plans to develop AI-based tools that can provide personalized recommendations for merchant customers. For example, during COVID-19, the platform suggested how much disinfectants a store should stock.</p>
<p>In a statement, Falcon Edge co-founder Navroz D. Udwadia said, “GudangAda is definitively the largest SME e-commerce marketplace in Indonesia with best-in-class metrics. Our research and conversations with stakeholders (principals, wholesalers and retailers) has given us confidence on GudangAda’s distinctive ROI and value addition to the entire ecosystem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://aruna.id/">Aruna</a>’s founders first met at university, they wanted to find a way to use their studies in information technology to help family members who were running small fisheries. Indonesia is one of the world’s largest fisheries producers, but the industry is very fragmented. This means fisheries, especially small ones, deal with fluctuations in demand and price instability. Aruna was created to bring them closer to customers like restaurants and exporters, the way <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/farm-to-table/">farm-to-table startups</a> are aggregating the agricultural supply chain.</p>
<p>Aruna announced today it has raised $35 million in Series A funding led by Prosus Ventures and East Ventures Growth Fund, with participation from SIG and returning investors including AC Ventures, MDI and Vertex Ventures. Aruna says this is the largest Series A investment to date in Indonesia’s agritech and maritime sector.</p>
<p>The company works primarily with small fisheries (or ones that have boats with about one to two metric tonnes of capacity) and focuses on sustainability, helping suppliers adhere to the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">United Nations Goal 14’s targets.</a> These include preventing overfishing, protecting coastal ecosystems and giving small-scale fisheries access to more resources and markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aruna was founded in 2016 by Farid Naufal Aslam, Indraka Fadhlillah and Utari Octavianty, who met while studying information technology administration and management at Telkom University. Fadhlillah and Octavianty came from families in the fishing industry, and the three wanted to create something that would solve some of the challenges they faced.</p>
<p>“This was the main idea, but the bigger thing we saw at the time was the advantage of Indonesia’s position as a large agricultural country with big potential in the seafood industry,” Aslam told TechCrunch.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indonesian agritech platform TaniHub Group harvests a $65.5M Series B round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/indonesian-agritech-platform-tanihub-group-harvests-a-65-5m-series-b-round/embed/#?secret=pMaCTz7hcA" data-secret="pMaCTz7hcA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/30/new-initiative-to-improve-sustainability-of-indonesia-fisheries">the World Bank</a>, Indonesia is the world’s second largest fisheries producer. The sector creates about $4.1 billion in annual export earnings and supports more than 7 million jobs.</p>
<p>But Aruna’s founding team saw two major problems while analyzing coastal communities. The first one was market access and getting fair prices for seafood. The second was access to working capital.</p>
<p>To solve the first issue, Aruna was built to shorten the supply chain, which Aslam said can have six or seven layers between fisheries and buyers like restaurants, markets or exporters.</p>
<p>Buyers make purchase orders through the platform, which are then distributed to fishery communities that Aruna organizes to focus on particular types of seafood. This helps them predict demand, guarantee return business and prevent overfishing.</p>
<p>Aruna also built a logistics network that includes more than 45 collection sites, or warehouses where seafood is delivered by fisheries for quality checks, processing and packaging. Aruna’s warehouses are a combination of facilities that it owns or runs with partners. Deliveries are performed by third-party logistics providers.</p>
<p>The platform currently has about 20 product categories and will use its funding to expand into more. Its commodities include high-value products like lobster, which are shipped by exporters to markets like Malaysia, Singapore, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>One of Aruna’s main requirements for fisheries on the platform is sticking to its sustainability process. According to the World Bank, one of the biggest issues facing Indonesia fisheries is overfishing, which hurts marine biodiversity. Aruna team members work with fisheries to standardize their equipment so they comply with government regulations and chose locations that are not overfished.</p>
<p>By focusing on a few types of seafood each, fisheries that work with Aruna are better able to ensure the quality and traceability of their products, and manage pricing fluctuations.</p>
<p>The second problem Aruna is working on is lack of access to working capital. To help fisheries get low interest, collateral-free loans for equipment and other things they need for their businesses, Aruna partners with financial institutions and fintech companies. When an Aruna fishery applies for a loan, the platform is able to provide transaction data collected on the platform for credit scoring.</p>
<p>The company also announced today that it has appointed Budiman Goh as its president, and Octavianty as its chief sustainability officer. Its funding will be used to expand to new areas in Indonesia, hiring data analytics and tech development, including IoT devices to help perform quality checks.</p>
<p>Aruna plans to focus on Indonesia for the near future because of the large number of fisheries in the country.</p>
<p>“Currently we have 21,000 fishermen on the platform, yet there are about 2.7 million fishermen in Indonesia, so there is a lot of room to grow,” Aslam said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sachin Bhanot, Prosus Ventures’ head of Southeast Asia investment said, “Having built a robust supply chain and technology infrastructure steeped with deep industry knowledge and expertise, we believe Aruna is uniquely positioned to service the growing global demand for sustainable fishery product, while supporting the livelihood of local fishermen.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Extra Crunch for July 21, 2021. It’s been a good day for crypto fans, with major coins seeing some recovery from recent lows. Bitcoin and ether remain depressed on a seven-day time frame, however. And the stock market is up today. What more can we ask for on a Wednesday? Well, how about a huge run of startup and tech news? We can do that! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">Clubhouse leaves beta:</a></strong> Clubhouse, the buzzy live-audio startup that captivated the technology world earlier this year, is out of beta. The move feels a hair late given the work that Twitter has done with its Spaces product, but is welcome all the same. Data indicates that Clubhouse is having a moment in India, a key tech market as Daily Crunch has discussed ad nauseam.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">Tumblr goes pro:</a> </strong>Feeling like a comeback story? Tumblr certainly does. After winding up as part of Yahoo thanks to a $1.3 billion deal, and later part of Verizon after the company (and still TechCrunch’s parent company’s parent company) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/verizon-buys-yahoo-for-4-83-billion/#:~:text=Verizon%20%28which%20owns%20AOL%2C%20which%20owns%20TechCrunch%29%20is,includes%20Yahoo%E2%80%99s%20advertising%2C%20content%2C%20search%20and%20mobile%20activities.">bought the online portal giant</a>, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/what-will-tumblr-become-under-the-ownership-of-techs-only-goldilocks-founder/">got sold to Automattic for a song</a>. Now it wants to join the creator economy boom by allowing its users to put up paywalls. We’re here for it &#8212; the internet would be more fun with a healthy Tumblr in the mix.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/byjus-acquires-reading-platform-epic-for-500-million-in-us-expansion-push/">Byju’s comes to America:</a> </strong>Indian edtech superstar Byju’s is coming to the U.S. on the heels of its newly announced $500 million deal for Epic, what TechCrunch described as a “California-headquartered reading platform.” The edtech market is hot, something that we’ve long known. Duolingo’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">IPO is also in the mix</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/sololearn-raises-24m-for-its-bite-sized-duolingo-like-mobile-first-coding-education-app/">is a recent $24 million round for Sololearn</a>, a startup that wants to take the Duolingo model and apply it to learning to code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have lots to chat about today from the world of startups thanks to the supercharged venture capital cadence around the world. Up top, if you are keeping tabs on the Robinhood IPO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/what-robinhoods-warnings-about-crypto-trading-say-about-coinbases-near-term-future/">our latest notes are here</a>. Now, let’s talk tech upstarts and private capital, starting with some fintech updates.</p>
<h3>Fintech</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/"><strong>Lending startup Upgrade embraces crypto:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Back in 2019, TechCrunch took note of Upgrade, a consumer lending startup from LendingClub founder Renaud Laplanche. Today the startup rolled out a credit card with bitcoin rewards. If you need a few more satoshis worth of $BTC and want to build credit, this might be for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/whenthens-no-code-payments-platform-attracts-6m-from-european-vcs-stride-and-cavalry/"><strong>No-code + Payments = WhenThen:</strong></a> WhenThen’s no-code payments service is not struggling to explain itself to investors, its latest $6 million round indicates. Its service, TechCrunch reports, allows customers to “autonomously orchestrate, monitor, improve and manage all customer payments and payments ops.” The no-code element likely means it&#8217;s a bit more friendly to the non-developers out there. We grade this idea neat out of 10.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/spendesk-raises-118-million-for-its-corporate-spend-management-service/">$118M more for corporate spend management:</a> </strong>Here in the U.S., the corporate spend wars have Ramp versus Airbase versus Brex on the front lines. But that doesn’t mean that the popular model of fusing corporate cards and software to help companies manage their overall dispensation of funds is fully figured out. Especially in a global context. And now Spendesk has a fresh €100 million in its own accounts to spend taking on the EU market. I wonder what service it will use to track those costs?</li>

<h2>These simple metrics will tell you if your startup is ready to scale</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a temptation inside early-stage startups to claim that the go-to-market strategy is fully operational. In reality, GTM is a stark numbers game, and even with a solid plan in place, it can be easily foiled by common problems like turf battles and poor communication.</p>
<p>Finding GTM fit is a milestone for any startup that can include anything from expanding the engineering team to launching your first media buy. But how do you know when you&#8217;ve reached that magic moment?</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to consider three metrics: gross churn rate, the magic number and gross margin,&#8221; says Tae Hea Nahm, co-founder and managing director of Storm Ventures.</p>
<p>High churn means customers aren&#8217;t delighted, low gross margins mean poor unit economics, and that so-called magic number?</p>
<p>&#8220;You can calculate it by taking new ARR divided by your marketing and sales spending,&#8221; according to Nahm. &#8220;But keep in mind that the magic number is a lagging indicator, and it may take you a few quarters to see a positive result.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian electric vehicle charging stations are coming to yet another state park system. The EV startup said it would install its so-called &#8220;waypoint&#8221; chargers at all of Tennessee’s 56 state parks, just four months after announcing a similar agreement with the state of Colorado.</p>
<p>It’s the next step in Rivian’s plans to build out its network of more than 10,000 Level 2 AC chargers by the end of 2023. Installing chargers at state parks and other far-flung locales is a key facet of Rivian’s brand strategy: to position itself as an eco-friendly automaker for the outdoorsy type regardless of whether they own a Rivian vehicle. The waypoint chargers will be open to the public and accessible to all electric vehicle brands with a J1772 plug.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Rivian will design and install the chargers at no cost, and cover all servicing, maintenance and upgrades for 10 years. The automaker said it will also cover any needed utility upgrades associated with the charger installations — for example, improvements to electrical service panels or transformers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Rivian could start installing chargers as early as this fall. The Level 2 chargers can provide up to 11.5 kilowatts of power. That roughly translates to adding up to 25 miles of range every hour for both the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV. While waiting hours for a battery refill isn’t ideal for chargers located along highways and busy thoroughfares, Rivian says these sites will allow drivers “to top up on miles while enjoying a day trip or an overnight campout.”</p>
<p>Charging will initially be provided at no cost, though the automaker noted that future costs could be dependent on how the state decides to recover electricity costs.</p>
<p>Rivian Waypoints are separate from the company’s so-called Adventure Network, its plan to build <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/rivian-to-install-more-than-10000-ev-chargers-by-end-of-2023/">more than 3,500 DC fast chargers</a> exclusively for Rivian customers. Those chargers will be able to provide up to 140 miles of range in around 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Rivian founder RJ Scaringe has been open about his desire to develop a charging network inclusive of hard-to-reach places — a notable difference from a company like Tesla, whose proprietary network of Superchargers is located in more conventional and even high-end places.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about the opportunity to create Rivian charging locations that aren’t on the interstate, that help draw you or enable you to go to places that normally are not the kinds of places that invite or welcome electric vehicles because of charging infrastructure,” he said in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/rivian-is-building-its-own-ev-charging-network-but-with-an-adventurous-twist/">wide-ranging interview</a> with TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec. “We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how you can essentially create these curated drives where, depending on your point of interest, you can pick different paths. If you want to stop midway through the trip for a one-mile, two-mile or five-mile hike, you know, here’s a route that you want to take and here’s a charging location right next to it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As longtime TechCrunch readers know well, Michael Arrington co-founded TechCrunch and Crunchbase, as well as the venture fund CrunchFund, which was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crunchfund-rebrands-as-tuesday-capital-1528935755">later renamed</a> Tuesday Capital. But In 2017, Arrington announced that he was shifting gears and becoming a full-time crypto investor, and despite a volatile ride since, he isn&#8217;t looking back, seemingly. As he said during an interview late last week from his new home in Miami, &#8220;I like reinventing myself and I think more people should do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the heels of a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/arrington-capital-launches-100m-algorand-ecosystem-fund">new fund</a> announcement last month, we decided to catch up with Arrington to learn more about the hedge fund firm he has been building in recent years with longtime business partner Heather Harde; longtime investor-entrepreneur Ron Palmeri; and Ninor and Ninos Mansor, brothers whose crypto firm <a href="https://www.tokenpost.com/Arrington-XRP-Capital-acquires-crypto-focused-private-fund-ByteSize-Capital-1549">merged</a> with Arrington&#8217;s <a href="https://arringtonxrpcapital.com/">Arrington XRP Capital</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Our chat has been edited for length and clarity below. You can hear that longer conversation <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8877590">here</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You recently moved to Miami. Why?</strong></p>
<p>MA: I visited Miami earlier this year for the first time in a couple decades and was here just for fun on a vacation. Part of it might have been that it was one of the first times I&#8217;ve been out and social since COVID. Part of it might just be it&#8217;s actually wonderful here in the winter. I think it was February when I came. But we just fell in love with the city and got to know the mayor, got to know some people here. A lot of my friends, particularly from New York and San Francisco, had already moved here, and it just felt very welcoming. The city’s government seems to care about its citizens and wants them to be happy, or at least not explicitly trying to make them unhappy. So we came back to look at houses a couple times [and] moved here pretty quickly.</p>
<p><strong>A number of venture firms have recently relocated to Miami &#8212; is there a kind of Sand Hill Road forming anywhere?</strong></p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve learned so far is that there are three areas of Miami that people live in. The first is downtown Miami, which is very centrally located and where business gets done. Another area south of that is where all the schools are, and it&#8217;s more suburban, and that&#8217;s where we live. The last area is Miami Beach where all the fun happens.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a young entrepreneur, just trying to figure out where you&#8217;re going to make your mark, they all seem to be located downtown. A lot of the really wealthy entrepreneurs are in Miami Beach, and then people who have kids are generally down south.</p>
<p><strong>Is the process of meeting with founders any different in Miami than in California?</strong></p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m doing crypto now, it&#8217;s still a lot of Zoom meetings with Asia and Europe and Russia and all over the world. But there are a lot of in-person meetings here. I&#8217;ve already been to a few events here. It’s very much like Silicon Valley was in 2005 when I was starting TechCrunch. It&#8217;s a small community, people are very [helpful to one another].</p>
<p><strong>People who haven’t followed your career might wonder why you veered so directly into crypto when you did. </strong></p>
<p>I started it just because it was new and I like reinventing myself and I think more people should do that. I think a lot of people become very good at something, and then keep doing that, and stop exploring the world. Even though some VCs I know are multibillionaires, they just keep doing [the same thing]. And it&#8217;s like, well, you&#8217;ve made all the money, why not just explore something else?</p>
<p>My career has always been a series of reinventions. TechCrunch was one of those reinventions. So for me, this is just the next step. And I&#8217;m 50. Now, I plan on doing this right now for the rest of my career, but we&#8217;ll see in five or seven years if something else takes my fancy.</p>
<p><strong> When you <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/11/28/arrington-xrp/">announced</a> your first crypto fund, there were some twists. It was a hedge fund, not a venture fund, and it was denominated in the crypto currency XRP, created by Ripple Labs. Why hitch your wagon to XRP, and what is your relationship with Ripple exactly?</strong></p>
<p>As I was getting into crypto, I was talking to Brad Garlinghouse, who was CEO at the time, and he told me that some people had approached him about maybe doing a venture fund or a hedge fund that was funded by Ripple. And I said, ‘Well, that&#8217;s interesting, because I&#8217;m thinking about raising a fund.’ And so we explored it. Ultimately, we realized it didn&#8217;t work for tax reasons. Ripple holds a lot of XRP, and they do different things with it to try to make the ecosystem for XRP more robust, but if they were to put a sizable amount of XRP into a new fund, that&#8217;s a tax-free exchange, but as soon as a fund invests it, then that underlying XRP would be taxed at capital-gains rates based on a zero basis and it would just be a huge tax bill.</p>
<p>At that point, I started talking to some non-tax foundations about doing the exact same thing. And it does work with the foundations because they don&#8217;t have to pay taxes and gains, and so a couple of foundations in Silicon Valley contributed a relatively large amount of XRP to us for our first close. And that provided the foundation of our fund. We went from there and took other LPs who put in money, or bitcoin or whatever, but that started with them. So we owe a lot to Ripple and to XRP. And we&#8217;ve been very loyal to them.</p>
<p><strong>Why structure it as a hedge fund?</strong></p>
<p>The reason why we wanted to create a hedge fund was we wanted to be able to recycle capital indefinitely. We make private investments very much like a venture fund. But we also have a pretty large active team based in Asia, and when you&#8217;re trading the venture fund, if you buy bitcoin and then you sell bitcoin, that&#8217;s it, you&#8217;re done. You return whatever you got from the sale to investors, and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s nuance to that. Venture funds usually can recycle 25% of their capital, for example, and over time, some of the newer venture funds and crypto funds have actually gotten to the point where they can recycle indefinitely for a period of time [and] look a lot more like hedge funds. But at the time we created our fund, that wasn&#8217;t state of the art.</p>
<p><strong>Ripple has been battling with the SEC since the agency<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338"> filed a lawsuit in December</a> accusing the company of violating federal securities laws. What do you make of what’s happening?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand it. The SEC basically let Ripple do its thing for half a decade before they said anything. And it&#8217;s odd to me that at some point, on [former SEC chief] Jay Clayton’s last day in office [as he was returning last year to private practice], they filed a lawsuit. So I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s political, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s personal, I literally just don&#8217;t know. And I have no idea how this is going to come out. It hinges on whether or not XRP is a security. And that depends on securities laws that were created in the ‘40s. Frankly, I think it&#8217;s all bullshit. But who knows?</p>
<p><strong>You’ve talked openly about having a terrible year in 2018. Your fund lost a lot of its value as the broader crypto market collapsed. You narrowly avoided entering into a death spiral. Where have you made the most money as a crypto investor?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, bitcoin and ETH fell 80%. I think XRP fell 90%, something like that. We fell 42% that first year, so it was bad &#8212; 42% first year out the door is not good. But we beat the market. And so one of our main LPs actually reupped in December of 2018 and gave us another $30 million in XRP that we ended up using mostly to buy bitcoin at $3,500 and that provided a foundation of bitcoin in our fund that we hold even until today.</p>
<p>When bitcoin is doing terribly, historically it&#8217;s been a wonderful time to buy it, and that will remain true until it isn&#8217;t true anymore. So we remain very bullish in down markets and very cautious in up markets. It&#8217;s not clear to me what market we&#8217;re in right now. We think we&#8217;re in the middle of an up market with a pause here for 60 or 90 days.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think we&#8217;re in the middle of an up market?</strong></p>
<p>One of the things we look at are the derivatives markets &#8212; so people longing and shorting and there&#8217;s a bunch of interesting derivatives markets with bitcoin and ETH and others; there are these perpetual futures contracts where people are betting and you see the longs and the shorts stack up. And right now we&#8217;re seeing a lot of shorting in different ways of bitcoin. When that happens, you can have short squeezes, which tend to drive the price way up. So when the market gets super, super short, we get very, very bullish, because you can see squeezes happen and drive the price up as people are liquidated and have to buy to cover their positions. You see that all the time. It happens the other way, too. Sometimes the market gets very, very long, and you see long squeezes, and when that happens, we get nervous and we start to hedge our positions there.</p>
<p><strong>You’re watching the derivatives markets. Are you also participating in them?</strong></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t get too exotic. A lot of the really exotic stuff is on unregulated exchanges with fairly serious counter-party risk and it&#8217;s fine if you&#8217;re doing bets of $100,000. It&#8217;s definitely not fine if you&#8217;re doing bets of $30 million to $40 million at a time, which we sometimes do.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve done well by stocking up on bitcoin; where have you seen the biggest losses?</strong></p>
<p>So we&#8217;re doing some equity investments, and it’s indistinguishable from venture investing … but most of our deals are in tokens that we’re purchasing well before they&#8217;re released … these token deals tend to mature much more quickly than equity deals. Sometimes, it’s a year or two but usually it’s a much shorter time frame. We had a deal 50x this year like a month after we invested. They tend to fail faster and succeed faster. So we’ve had losses all over the place.</p>
<p>But our venture side, our losses are much smaller than they should be, so that worries me. It worries me that it&#8217;s not sustainable, because of course it isn&#8217;t, and so we were worried about that. We&#8217;re trying not to make long-term investment decisions based on short-term success. But the real losses just come in the wild swings of the market. I mean … last year, we had well over $1 billion in assets under management and that has taken a dramatic haircut in the last several weeks … it&#8217;s just part of crypto’s volatility.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve got other funds cooking. You recently announced you were <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/arrington-capital-launches-100m-algorand-ecosystem-fund">launching</a> a $100 million fund for bets on projects building on the Algorand blockchain.</strong></p>
<p>That fund is just getting its legs under it now.</p>
<p><strong>Why index so heavily on Algorand?</strong></p>
<p>Algorand is a layer-one coin, and that means it&#8217;s a network coin that has infrastructure to allow third parties to create new companies and protocols on the coin. And the founder Silvio [Micali] is literally, like, Einstein-level brilliant, and he has come up with what he thinks is a way to have your cake and eat it, too [in terms of developing a network that’s both decentralized and where transactions can happen quickly], and we believe he&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><strong>Just before we hopped on this call, Dogecoin&#8217;s founder, Jackson Palmer, published a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/dogecoin-co-creator-jackson-palmer-criticizes-the-crypto-industry.html">streak of tweets</a> in which he accuses the crypto industry of all the things that already worry people about it. He says he believes that &#8220;cryptocurrency is an inherently right wing hypercapital capitalistic technology built primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight and artificial enforced scarcity.&#8221; Have you seen these? Do you think there&#8217;s some truth to what he&#8217;s saying here?</strong></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t looked at these specific tweets yet, but based on what you just said, I don&#8217;t disagree entirely. Crypto &#8212; Bitcoin in particular &#8212; is fundamentally anti-statist. It&#8217;s trying to rip the idea of money away from the state in the name of economic freedom, and people either agree with that or disagree with that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a libertarian and it just happens to fit my world worldview perfectly. But there are tons of statists in crypto and tax avoidance is hard. As an American, it&#8217;s pretty darn hard to avoid crypto taxes at this point, and I certainly don&#8217;t even try. I just pay the taxes and smile and go on my way. But there are a lot of people who are in crypto for the money and not for the politics of it, and that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m not sure they see the ultimate outcome of Bitcoin being what I see it as.</p>
<p>There are a lot of multibillionaires who control large parts of crypto, but I think that&#8217;s why we need to see more and more people get into crypto, so that that [wealth] gets distributed among more people as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As phones and other consumer devices have gained feature after feature, they have also declined in how easily they can be repaired, with Apple at the head of this ignoble pack. The FTC has taken note, admitting that the agency has been lax on this front but that going forward it will prioritize what could be illegal restrictions by companies as to how consumers can repair, repurpose and reuse their own property.</p>
<p>Devices are often built today with no concessions made toward easy repair or refurbishment, or even once-routine upgrades like adding RAM or swapping out an ailing battery. While companies like Apple do often support hardware for a long time in some respects, the trade-off seems to be that if you crack your screen, the maker is your only real option to fix it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a problem for many reasons, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/massachusetts-voters-pass-a-right-to-repair-measure-giving-them-unprecedented-access-to-their-car-data/">right-to-repair</a> activist and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/ifixit-introduces-a-free-database-of-medical-repair-manuals/">iFixit founder</a> Kyle Wiens has argued indefatigably for years (the company <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/51520/ftc-unanimously-approves-policy-of-fighting-repair-restrictions">posted proudly about the statement on its blog</a>). The FTC sought comment on this topic back in 2019, issued a report on the state of things a few months ago, and now (perhaps emboldened by new chair Lina Khan&#8217;s green light to all things fearful to Big Tech companies) has issued a policy statement.</p>
<p>The gist of the unanimously approved statement is that they found that the practice of deliberately restricting repairs may have serious repercussions, especially among people who don&#8217;t have the cash to pay the Apple tax for what ought to be (and once was) a simple repair.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Commission’s report on repair restrictions explores and discusses a number of these issues and describes the hardships repair restrictions create for families and businesses. The Commission is concerned that this burden is borne more heavily by underserved communities, including communities of color and lower-income Americans. The pandemic exacerbated these effects as consumers relied more heavily on technology than ever before.</p>
<p>While unlawful repair restrictions have generally not been an enforcement priority for the Commission for a number of years, the Commission has determined that it will devote more enforcement resources to combat these practices. Accordingly, the Commission will now prioritize investigations into unlawful repair restrictions under relevant statutes&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement then makes four basic points. First, it reiterates the need for consumers and other public organizations to report and characterize what they perceive as unfair or problematic repair restrictions. The FTC doesn&#8217;t go out and spontaneously investigate companies, it generally needs a complaint to set the wheels in motion, such as people alleging that Facebook is misusing their data.</p>
<p>Second is a surprising antitrust tie-in, where the FTC says it will look at said restrictions aiming to answer whether monopolistic practices like tying and exclusionary design are in play. This could be something like refusing to allow upgrades, then charging an order of magnitude higher than market price for something like a few extra gigs of storage or RAM, or designing products in such a way that it moots competition. Or perhaps arbitrary warranty violations for doing things like removing screws or taking the device to a third party for repairs. (Of course, these would depend on establishing monopoly status or market power for the company, something the FTC has had trouble doing.)</p>
<p>More in line with the FTC&#8217;s usual commercial regulations, it will assess whether the restrictions are &#8220;unfair acts or practices,&#8221; which is a much broader and easier to meet requirement. You don&#8217;t need a monopoly to make claims of an &#8220;open standard&#8221; to be misleading, or for a hidden setting to slow the operations of third-party apps or peripherals, for instance.</p>
<p>And lastly the agency mentions that it will be working with states in its push to establish new regulations and laws. This is perhaps a reference to the pioneering &#8220;right to repair&#8221; bills like the one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/massachusetts-voters-pass-a-right-to-repair-measure-giving-them-unprecedented-access-to-their-car-data/">passed by Massachusetts last year</a>. Successes and failures along those lines will be taken into account and the feds and state policymakers will be comparing notes.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first movement in this direction by a long shot, but it is one of the plainest. Tech companies have seen the writing on the wall, and done things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/apple-expands-its-independent-repair-program-to-mac-after-us-antitrust-investigation-examined-companys-repair-policies/">expand independent repair programs</a> — but it&#8217;s arguable that these actions were taken in anticipation of the FTC&#8217;s expected shift toward establishing hard lines on the topic.</p>
<p>The FTC isn&#8217;t showing its full hand here, but it&#8217;s certainly hinting that it&#8217;s ready to play if the companies involved want to push their luck. We&#8217;ll probably know more soon once it starts ingesting consumer complaints and builds a picture of the repair landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.draftkings.com/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2F">DraftKings</a> is charging into the NFT game, announcing a marketplace aimed at curating sports and entertainment-themed digital collectibles for its audience of enthusiasts. The platform is &#8220;debuting later this summer,&#8221; and showcases another potentially lucrative expansion for the fantasy sports betting company.</p>
<p>DraftKings is entering a market that is both crowded and sparse &#8212; with plenty of NFT marketplace options for today&#8217;s niche group of collectors, though offerings are still light when considering the billions that have flowed through the space in the first several months of the year. This week, investors gave NFT marketplace OpenSea a $1.5 billion valuation. Dapper Labs, which makes NBA Top Shot, recently raised at a reported $7.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Dapper&#8217;s existing sway in the space will leave DraftKings pursuing opportunities outside exclusive league partnerships. NBA Top Shot allows players to buy &#8220;Moments&#8221; from NBA history, clips of actual game and player footage to which it has access via league and players&#8217; association partnerships. In addition to the NBA, Dapper has already partnered with other leagues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DraftKings&#8217; foothold in the space will come from an exclusive partnership with <a href="https://autograph.io/">Autograph</a>, a newly launched NFT startup co-founded by quarterback Tom Brady. The company has inked exclusive NFT deals with some top athletes, including Tiger Woods, Wayne Gretzky, Derek Jeter, Naomi Osaka and Tony Hawk, hoping to build out its platform as the hub for sports personality collectibles.</p>
<p>Aside from the partnerships, DraftKings is hoping to get a leg up in the space by further simplifying the user onboarding process, allowing users to buy NFTs without loading a wallet with cryptocurrency, instead purchasing with USD. When the platform launches, users will be able to purchase NFTs from DraftKings and resell or trade them through the platform.</p>

<p>For DraftKings, which has raised some $720 million in funding since launch in 2012, the NFT expansion could offer an opportunity of funneling their existing audience into the new vertical. Few existing tech startups have made noteworthy expansions into the NFT world despite plenty of hype and investor interest. DraftKings co-founder Matt Kalish tells TechCrunch that the startup&#8217;s devoted community is its biggest asset to winning in the rising space.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;DraftKings has millions of people in our community who show up to out-platform every day and every week,&#8221; Kalish says. &#8220;We think our biggest advantage is the strength and size of our community&#8230; [We] will bring a lot of eyeballs to the table.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla will &#8216;most likely&#8217; resume accepting bitcoin as a form of payment once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables, CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday at a virtual panel discussion hosted by the Crypto Council for Innovation, remarks that are in line with statements he made last month on Twitter.</p>
<p>Tesla started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in February, the same time that the company purchased a historic $1.5 billion in bitcoin — before reneging on its decision just three months later, citing environmental concerns.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Cryptocurrencies get a bad rap for energy usage because they do indeed use up an awful lot of energy, at least many of them do. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the space’s two biggest currencies, use a mechanism called proof-of-work to power their networks and mint new blocks of each currency. The “work” is solving complex cryptographic problems and miners do so by stringing together high-end graphics cards to tackle these problems. Major mining centers have thousands of GPUs running around the clock.</p>
<p>While Ethereum has already committed to transitioning away from proof-of-work to something called proof-of-stake, which vastly reduces energy usage, Bitcoin seems less likely to make this transition. So, becoming “eco-friendly” likely doesn’t mean making any major underlying changes to Bitcoin, but rather shifting what energy sources are powering those mining centers.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin’s global mining network does clearly lean on renewables, it’s pretty difficult to get exact insights on what the spread of renewables usage is given how, ahem, decentralized the grid is. What is clear is that it’s going to take some unprecedented transparency from the global network to even give Musk a starting point here to judge Bitcoin’s current or future “eco-friendliness,” and in all likelihood Musk will have a lot of wiggle room to make this decision based on anecdotal data whenever he wants.</p>
<p>Today’s comments come as no surprise: He tweeted in June, “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.”</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.</p>
<p>When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1404132183254523905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p>His comments do give him plenty of wiggle room, however. “As long as there is a conscious effort to move bitcoin miners toward renewables then Tesla can support that,” he added later in the talk. A large portion of bitcoin mining was done in China, where cheap coal and hydropower made it slightly more economical; but Musk noted that some of these coal plants have been shut down (and a large portion of miners in China have started to migrate abroad, in response to mining crackdowns by the Chinese party).</p>
<p>It should also be noted that his concerns over bitcoin’s environmental impact have caused controversy in the bitcoin community, with some arguing that bitcoin receives an oversized amount of scrutiny relative to its actual energy consumption. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who also participated in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwx_7XAJ3p0&amp;ab_channel=ARKInvest">virtual panel</a>, has actually argued that bitcoin can incentivize the transition to renewable energy. A <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf">white paper</a> published by the Bitcoin Clean Energy Initiative, a program created by Square, argues that bitcoin mining could make renewables even cheaper and more economically feasible than they are today.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s comments, as ambiguous as they were, shows he still exerts considerable power over cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin price fell below $30,000 on Monday, after hitting an all-time high of over $63,000 in April. But after the billionaire founder revealed more details about his and his companies’ holdings at the virtual panel, the price rebounded.</p>
<p>In addition to personal bitcoin holdings and Tesla’s bitcoin holdings, his aerospace company SpaceX also owns bitcoin. Musk added that he also personally owns ether and (of course) dogecoin. The price for all three cryptocurrencies rose after his comments.</p>
