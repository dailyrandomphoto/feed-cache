										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart and TikTok announced this morning they will be partnering on the first pilot test of a new shoppable product experience on TikTok&#8217;s social video app. Walmart, as you may recall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-deal/">had planned to invest in TikTok</a> when the app was being threatened with a ban from the U.S. market unless it sold its U.S. operations to an American company, per a Trump administration executive order &#8212;  a ban that&#8217;s now<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/second-federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administrations-tiktok-ban/"> on pause after multiple legal challenges</a>. Walmart&#8217;s interest in TikTok, however, has not waned. The retailer, though seemingly an odd fit for a social network, had seen the potential to attract a younger online consumer through video and, in particular, live streamed video.</p>
<p>This is what the new test on TikTok will involve, as well.</p>
<p>During a Walmart live stream, TikTok users will be able to shop from Walmart&#8217;s fashion items without having to leave the TikTok app, in a pilot of TikTok&#8217;s new &#8220;shoppable product.&#8221; The fashion items themselves will be featured in content from ten TikTok creators, led by host <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@justmaiko">Michael Le, </a>whose TikTok dances have earned him 43+ million fans. Other creators will be more up-and-coming stars, like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@devanondeck">Devan Anderson</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tayhage">Taylor Hage</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@muslimthicc">Zahra Hashimee</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All will be participating in a special event hosted on TikTok called the &#8220;Holiday Shop-Along Spectacular,&#8221; which will take place on Friday, Dec. 18 at 8 PM ET on Walmart&#8217;s TikTok profile.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088386" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088386" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2088386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Edge_Walmart_TheScoop_ScoopNewsletter_16x9.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088386" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>During this special, the creators will show off their favorite Walmart fashion finds in their own unique ways. For some, that will mean giving fans a peek inside their closet. Others may do a living room runway or even a fashionable &#8220;dance off,&#8221; Walmart says.</p>
<p>There are two ways TikTok users can shop for the fashion items featured.</p>
<p>As products are shown on screen, pins will pop-up which users can tap to add the item to their cart. They&#8217;re then directed to a mobile checkout experience. Alternately, customers can choose to tap on a shopping cart pin at the end of the event to look through all the items featured and select what they’d like to purchase.</p>
<p>And for anyone who misses the event, they&#8217;ll still be able to shop the items from Walmart&#8217;s TikTok profile when the Shop-Along event is over.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re constantly looking for ways to innovate the shopping experience for our customers,&#8221; said Walmart&#8217;s U.S. Chief Marketing Officer, William White, in an announcement. &#8220;We’re moving faster than ever to find new and improved ways to better serve our customers and meet them where they are. We created this event for, about, and by our community, reflecting the lives, passions and styles of a diverse set of creators so everyone watching will feel represented, no matter who they are or how they outfit their closet,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Walmart said the idea to partner on mobile shopping didn&#8217;t emerge as a result of the recent deal talks, as it&#8217;s been an active brand on the platform for over a year. (In fact, it&#8217;s even tasked its employees with making TikTok videos, <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/a-true-influencer-program-inside-walmarts-growing-army-of-employee-tiktokers/">a recent report from ModernRetail detailed</a>.)</p>
<p>The retailer also told TechCrunch there&#8217;s not a revenue share with TikTok on the sales it makes through the app, nor any fees, as this is considered a joint test.</p>

<p>This is not TikTok&#8217;s first foray into shoppable video.</p>
<p>The company has been exploring this space for some time, including with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/tiktoks-new-hashtag-challenge-plus-lets-video-viewers-shop-for-products-in-the-app/">last year&#8217;s launch of the Hashtag Challenge Plus</a> which added a shoppable component to a hashtag, directing video viewers to shop a site from within TikTok. This year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/levis-partnered-with-tiktok-on-social-commerce-and-doubled-its-product-views/">brands like Levi&#8217;s leveraged</a> TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;Shop Now&#8221; buttons that allowed consumers to make purchases through links posted on TikTok. And in a significant deal just this fall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">TikTok formally partnered with Shopify on social commerce</a> by allowing Shopify merchants to create, run and optimize their TikTok marketing campaigns directly from the Shopify dashboard.</p>
<p>Live-streamed shopping is also a fast-growing and lucrative market, as younger users are turning to influencers and online video to both be entertained and to shop.</p>
<p>All the major tech companies have invested in this space as well, to varying degrees, including not only Facebook (in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">an aggressive push</a> across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/facebook-shop-instagram-live-shopping/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">Instagram</a>), but also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/googles-latest-rd-project-is-shoploop-a-mobile-video-shopping-platform/">Google through its R&amp;D arm</a>, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/08/amazon-live-is-the-retailers-latest-effort-to-take-on-qvc-with-live-streamed-video/">through its QVC-like Amazon Live</a>, Alibaba <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/alibaba-aliexpress-influencer-recruitment/">through AliExpress</a>, JD.com, Pinduoduo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/wechat-livestreaming-china-economy/">WeChat</a>, and even TikTok’s Chinese sister app, Douyin.</p>
<p>The trend is also fueling startups, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/bambuser-live-video-shopping/">Bambuser</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/">Popshop Live</a>, which have raised new rounds in 2020 for their own live-streamed shopping products.</p>
<p>For TikTok, however, is more of a natural evolution of its product where influencers are already showing off their favorite items, their fashion and style.</p>
<p>&#8220;At TikTok, we&#8217;re constantly exploring new ways to inspire creativity, bring joy and add value for our community,&#8221; said Blake Chandlee, Vice President, Global Business Solutions at TikTok. &#8220;Creators and brands have found a creative outlet to connect with audiences through TikTok Live, and we&#8217;re excited to further innovate on this interactive experience to enable our community to discover and engage with the brands they love,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brands have had an incredible impact on the community throughout this year, and we&#8217;re thrilled to see Walmart embrace the creativity of TikTok and this first-of-a-kind experience to meaningfully engage with their community,&#8221; Chandlee said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The idea sounds almost too simple. Create a version of Linkedin that&#8217;s specifically for the healthcare industry, where professionals can find out not just who has what credentials, but also learn about the research those professionals are conducting and the specialties they have.</p>
<p>In the middle of a global pandemic, when industry insiders are all trying to find out who is an expert in particular fields of medicine that are most impacted by a novel virus spreading like wildfire around the world, that simple idea becomes a necessity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the situation that <a href="https://h1insights.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup which just raised $58 million in new financing, found themselves in as the pandemic hit American shores earlier this year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/h1-insights-is-giving-the-healthcare-industry-the-ultimate-professional-database/"> only graduated from Y Combinator in January</a>, and now, less than a year later is closing on over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/y-combinator-graduate-h1-closes-on-12-9-million-for-its-professional-healthcare-database/">$70 million in total financing</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9JVZaNFsGK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/h1-insights-is-giving-the-healthcare-industry-the-ultimate-professional-database/">H1 Insights is giving the healthcare industry the ultimate professional database</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;H1 Insights is giving the healthcare industry the ultimate professional database&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/h1-insights-is-giving-the-healthcare-industry-the-ultimate-professional-database/embed/#?secret=9JVZaNFsGK" data-secret="9JVZaNFsGK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Doubling down on its previous investment in the company is <a href="https://www.menlovc.com/">Menlo Ventures</a>, which along with the growth stage investment firm, <a href="https://www.ivp.com/">IVP</a>, co-led the new financing for the company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their rationale for investing can be attributed to H1&#8217;s explosive growth. The company now has 250 employees after launching from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> just 12 months ago. Already a player in the US, H1 is looking to expand to Europe and Asia in 2021 and counts 13 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies as its clients. As of its last tally, the company already had profiles on over 9 million healthcare professionals worldwide.</p>
<p>According to one person with knowledge of the company&#8217;s fundraising history, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/menlo-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="menlo-ventures">Menlo Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was so pleased with the company&#8217;s performance that it offered tens of millions of dollars in pre-emptive financing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have created a platform for the healthcare ecosystem to connect in the same way Linkedin connected professional workers in the early 2000’s. There hasn’t been a global platform like H1 before that has connected industry to the right doctors the way H1 does,” said H1 co-founder and CEO Ariel Katz. “This next round of funding, with our excellent investment group, including Menlo who has been a great partner for us, will help us continue to become the largest healthcare professional platform and ultimately create a healthier future.”</span></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/menlo-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="menlo-ventures">Menlo Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> certainly thinks so.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we started working with H1, we could already see early evidence of product-market fit, including both early &#8216;beachhead&#8217; pharma deals and good logo velocity in smaller biotechs. Feedback from customers was stellar, both in terms of product value and commitment to customer success by the H1 team,&#8221; wrote Menlo Ventures partner Greg Yap and JP Sanday in a blog post. &#8220;One of our diligence intros even turned into a multi-million dollar customer and investor. But H1 was clearly still at an early stage of maturity for supporting large demanding enterprise customers. Now, at the Series B, H1 has ramped up execution, winning 13 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies as customers and meeting top-tier venture metrics in gross retention, net retention, and sales efficiency.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a> is launching a new product today called <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>. It competes directly with <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>, two cloud hosting companies that let you build and deploy sites using JAMstack frameworks. Popular JAMstack frameworks include Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, Vue.js, Next.js, etc.</p>
<p>If that announcement sounds familiar, that’s because reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong</a>, leaked <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1335198021131194370">details</a> about the upcoming product by looking into Cloudflare’s code. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cloudflare-is-testing-a-netlify-competitor-to-host-JAMstack-sites/">covered the leak</a> a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>“You saw Jane’s tweet and she sort of spilled the beans a little early, which I thought was kinda awesome,” <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cloudflare" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cloudflare">Cloudflare <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jqbiwi8C6d"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cloudflare-is-testing-a-netlify-competitor-to-host-jamstack-sites/">Cloudflare is testing a Netlify competitor to host Jamstack sites</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cloudflare is testing a Netlify competitor to host Jamstack sites&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cloudflare-is-testing-a-netlify-competitor-to-host-jamstack-sites/embed/#?secret=jqbiwi8C6d" data-secret="jqbiwi8C6d" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But now, Cloudflare Pages is live for real. It integrates seamlessly with a Git repository and existing JAMstack frameworks. When you push a new version of your site to your Git repository, Cloudflare automatically starts building and deploying your site on its network.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with JAMstack, it’s a popular way of developing and deploying websites at scale. It lets you take advantage of global edge networks with a focus on performance.</p>
<p>A JAMstack framework lets you decouple the frontend from the backend of your website. Every time you change something to your site, the entire frontend is prebuilt. Your pages are transformed into optimized static pages that can be hosted and cached on a global edge network. This way, pages are served in a few milliseconds across the world.</p>
<p>JAMstack websites don’t have to be 100% static. You can use APIs from popular API-based services, such as Stripe. Payment modules are loaded directly from Stripe’s server when the page is rendered in your web browser. You can also build your own microservices that are loaded on demand and that can scale easily.</p>
<p>Coming back to Cloudflare Pages, it integrates with GitHub and GitLab repositories if you’re hosting your source code on those platforms. Once you your site is configured, you can preview each commit from Cloudflare’s interface — each commit gets its own unique URL and there’s a preview environment.</p>
<p>You can collaborate with other Cloudflare users by inviting them to your Pages project. When your site looks good in the preview branch, you can push it to the production branch.</p>
<p>Cloudflare started working on Pages when people who don’t consider themselves as devops wanted to use Cloudflare. “People on the creative side told us, ‘hey are you interested in building a website builder?’” Prince said. He identified Wix and Squarespace as website builders.</p>
<p>At the same time, Cloudflare noticed that JAMstack was getting quite popular. “A lot of Netlify and Vercel customers actually put Cloudflare in front of their Netlify or Vercel sites,” he added. That doesn’t really make sense when it comes to cost and performance as you’re stacking multiple CDNs.</p>
<p>As Cloudflare already has a huge network of servers around the world, it doesn’t cost them that much money to host JAMstack websites on its edge network — it&#8217;s cheaper than caching content hosted by Netlify. That’s why there’s a generous free tier with unlimited bandwidth and unlimited requests.</p>
<p>“We timed the release intentionally to be this time of the year. We really wanted to give a gift back to the developer community,” Prince said.</p>
<p>The company expects to get a lot of attention with today’s release. It’s going to add a thousand people to the service per day up until January. After that, it’ll open the service to everyone.</p>
<p>Cloudflare thinks you’ll choose Pages for JAMstack projects because of the free tier and its robust infrastructure. But the company also expects users to try out other Cloudflare services down the road.</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to go beyond static websites, Cloudflare offers a serverless platform called <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Workers</a>. You can deploy some code on Workers and use it in your Pages site. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, you can go beyond stateless functions as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, as you start using Pages, you might be interesting Cloudflare’s advanced security features and other Cloudflare products. The company has always been betting on the long tail of developers to find its next customers, and Pages is another example of that strategy.</p>

<p>Launch startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astra-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astra-3">Astra <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had a monumental week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/launch-startup-astras-rocket-reaches-space-for-the-first-time/">achieving their first spaceflight with a rocket test on Tuesday</a>. Astra CEO Chris Kemp joined Relativity CEO Tim Ellis, and VOX Space President Mandy Vaughn at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">TC Sessions: Space</a> event on Wednesday, and with Relativity&#8217;s huge $500 million round earlier this year, and Virgin Orbit&#8217;s milestone test flight in May, it was a big year for all involved.</p>
<p>A significant portion of our discussion focused on the very different approaches that each of these launch companies is taking to solving what boils down to the same problem – improving cost and availability of launch. Kemp first described Astra&#8217;s approach, which boils down to rigorous and continuous process and cost optimization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Where we focus our software effort is in understanding where to make engineering optimizations,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;So by having an Astra operating system that is making it visible to all of our engineers, where your costs are, because you have a long lead time on this part, because there&#8217;s a lot of labor to assemble this part. [&#8230;] We&#8217;re not throwing any specific technology solution at a problem, we&#8217;re trying to basically triage the trade-offs that you&#8217;re making between the performance of the rocket – you can always use a higher-cost material, and you can potentially also use a higher cost manufacturing process, like 3D printing, but it isn&#8217;t always the right approach.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kemp added that Astra is essentially technology-agnostic when it comes to their production stack, and flexible in terms of how to configure that based on available resources and end goal parameters.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to optimize the overall economics of the business without regard to what technology you&#8217;re going to use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we pick the right technology to optimize the business based on the capital we have, and the production rate and the launch rate that we&#8217;re trying to target.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis, meanwhile, talked about <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kcura" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kcura">Relativity&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> use of 3D printing, and how it differs significantly from its use in the production stack of other existing rocket manufacturers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing at Relativity is completely different than then what almost everyone else is doing with using 3d printing for bits and pieces of a rocket,&#8221; he said.&#8221; From Apollo and launching rockets to the Moon, how we fundamentally build and develop, and the tool sets we use to make rockets and aerospace products is more or less the same as what it was 60 years ago – you walk into a factory, and it&#8217;s full of giant, expensive, fixed tooling, very complicated supply chains building products one at a time by hand with hundreds of thousands, to even millions of parts, depending on whether it&#8217;s a rocket or commercial aircraft.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088506" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088506" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2088506" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="639" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg 1072w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg?resize=768,479 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg?resize=680,424 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rocket-trio.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Virgin Orbit, Astra, Relativity Space</p></div></p>
<p>By contrast, Ellis pointed out that it&#8217;s creating rockets with less than 1,000 total components by viewing 3D printing from a top-down angle, and using it for the vast majority of the production process, rather than for select components.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re able to actually build each rocket and from raw material and fly it in 60 days, once our factories operational, and then 60 days later, we&#8217;ll do a better version and 60 days later, a better version than that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So the compounding rate of progress that&#8217;s possible with an all-in 3d printing approach, I believe, is equivalent to going from on-premise servers to cloud, or from gas internal combustion engines to electric – it&#8217;s really actually an entirely different tech stack and value chain, it&#8217;s not just the rocket itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vaughn pointed out that while all the companies have different approaches, they all seek to change the accessibility and cost of getting payloads to orbit. She then pointed out that Virgin Orbit has identified launch location flexibility as one of the key levers to speed that change in the right direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about getting mass to orbit. It&#8217;s about how do we change what is that cost point to do, and how do we change the accessibility to do so,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Also, really unique from our perspective is, what is that just kind of inherent mobility to do – so how can we actually just fly the launch pad around, and really change the CONOPS [concept of operations] of what it takes to establish an infrastructure and leverage that infrastructure to have access to space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit&#8217;s LauncherOne is carried by a modified 747 passenger airplane, which takes off from and lands at a traditional runway. That not only means the rocket itself requires less fuel, and therefore less mass, to deliver its cargo to orbit, but also introduces a lot of launch site flexibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;By changing the discussion in terms of what is a launch, and what is the end game, it&#8217;s not just about mass to orbit, it&#8217;s about all of these other elements of how can we react quickly, how can we design and produce something quickly, as well as deploy that capability, maybe in a unique way from an unexpected location, and then get the on-space effects delivered uniquely and quickly,&#8221; Vaughn said.</p>
<p>All three panelists agreed that the market will likely support many providers when it comes to small launch vehicles, and their existing sold inventory queues reflects that. We also heard later in the day from Amazon SVP Dave Limp, who pointed out that they alone will require multiple launch providers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/amazons-project-kuiper-will-seek-multiple-launch-providers-to-carry-its-satellites-to-space/">contracted for multiple missions to get Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper constellation in place on orbit</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corporate spend management startup <a href="https://t.co/robCWKydUu?amp=1">Ramp</a> has raised $30 million more in a new round, it announced today. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/">covered Ramp&#8217;s launch earlier this year</a>, when it also detailed that it had raised around $23 million up to that point.</p>
<p>The startup raised its latest round in August of 2020, with conversations about the deal kicking off in June. The new capital is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ramp-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ramp-3">Ramp&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> second priced raise after its August, 2019 seed round worth $8 million and the first after its February, 2020-era $15 million raise. D1 and Coatue were new investors in this new investment, which included some prior backers.</p>
<p>Ramp CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/eglyman">Eric Glyman</a> called the new equity something akin to a Series A3, noting that it had effectively reused docs from a preceding round, albeit with a new price attached. Venture history purists could argue that Ramp&#8217;s new raise was the company&#8217;s Series B &#8212; the second priced round after its seed &#8212; or that it is really a Series C, as the startup&#8217;s seed round was as big as a 2000s-era A and was also a priced event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Ramp did not need the funds. Per Glyman, the startup still had part of its original seed round in the bank when it raised the latest check. That implies that the company had more than $45 million in cash as of August, 2020.</p>
<p>Asked why he raised the capital if it was not needed, the CEO told TechCrunch that its new investors had &#8220;pretty unbelievable&#8221; investment track records. And Glyman added that the round was attractively priced, limiting dilution. The exec also said that having the new funds helped Ramp hire more aggressively with confidence.</p>
<p>But while the round is interesting to a degree, more intriguing is the space in which Ramp competes. So let&#8217;s talk about the power of software, and when the startup and its competitors might start charging more for their deployed code.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Ramp competes for market share in corporate spend management, an active vertical with a number of venture-backed players. That actor density has generated a level of competition that has rewritten the ground rules for getting credit and charge cards into the hands of companies. The table stakes are higher than ever in the niche.</p>
<p>Why? Because issuing credit and debit cards to consumers and corporations has largely been commoditized, causing startups hunting for slices of spend via interchange to build increasingly powerful software suites around their original products; if you can&#8217;t entice new customers with fancy cards, how about lots of digital tooling built around spend itself, to help your company manage and limit cash outflows?</p>
<p>The examples of this trend are myriad: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/brex" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="brex">Brex <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> built out a cash management solution, for example, and <a href="https://www.brex.com/solution/spend-management/">expense management</a> tools. Ramp itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/corp-card-startup-ramp-launches-expense-management-software/">launched expense management software of its own this year</a>, and Divvy <a href="https://getdivvy.com/expenses/">has a similar service</a> along with other card-related software tools.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HsCEDRjFPb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/corp-card-startup-ramp-launches-expense-management-software/">Corp card startup Ramp launches expense management software</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Corp card startup Ramp launches expense management software&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/corp-card-startup-ramp-launches-expense-management-software/embed/#?secret=HsCEDRjFPb" data-secret="HsCEDRjFPb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Venture capitalists have poured $55 million into Ramp, by our count, north of $400 million into Brex, not counting debt raised by the unicorn, and more than $250 million into <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/divvy-7ad9" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="divvy-7ad9">Divvy <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. So, the game of building increasingly robust software stacks atop corporate cards is one to watch, as the scale of venture bets made on the key players in the space is titanic.</p>
<p>Ramp is dropping new code with its funding news, underscoring the point. The company recently added <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ramp-vendor-management">vendor management tooling</a>, and is now adding reimbursing capabilities so that employees can be paid back for expenses not made on the startup&#8217;s cards.</p>
<p>Which of the three has the best software stack? They each think that they do, we reckon.</p>
<p>The result of the efforts by Ramp and its competitors to build out software around their card offerings has been rapid customer growth. Divvy, reached this week concerning its own metrics, told TechCrunch that it has seen its customer number expand 120% in 2020 and total spend on its platform rise 100% this year. Brex declined to share growth metrics.</p>
<p>Ramp announced its own growth figures as part of its news passel, including that it reached $100 million in spend on its platform in the first 18 months following its incorporation (a somewhat non-GAAP time frame, we admit), and that a quarter of the total spend that it has supported for corporations was recorded in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>There appears to be plenty of market for the startups to grow into, just as there is plenty of capital available for them to tap.</p>
<p>To close, a question: When will corporate spend management startups flip the switch, and start to charge for their software suite? Currently the trio make money largely from interchange, collecting a tiny piece of transactions that they power with their cards. This scales well, and keeps friction of signing up new customers low; after all, who doesn&#8217;t want a free set of financial tooling?</p>
<p>But, eventually, they will charge for their software. SaaS revenue is simply too highly valued to <em>not</em> go after. At some point. Perhaps that day will mark the end of the corporate spend <del>land</del> logo grab, and the start of the software niche&#8217;s maturation. At which point I expect new competitors to sprout up and <a href="https://media0.giphy.com/media/hWR9s5HqrbP3y/giphy.gif">the cycle to repeat</a>.</p>

SpaceX&#8217;s at-sea launches were introduced to allow for recovery of rocket boosters that didn&#8217;t have enough fuel remaining on board to make it all the way back to land – meaning this NRO mission&#8217;s parameters allow for a &#8216;return to sender&#8217; trip back home.</p>
<p>Typically, when there&#8217;s a longer launch window, SpaceX will aim to launch at the beginning, depending on weather conditions. If that&#8217;s the case today, the stream above should begin at around 8:45 AM EST (15 minutes prior to the opening of the window).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup with a new type of spacecraft propulsion system could make the interplanetary travel seen in Star Trek a reality. <a href="http://magdrivespace.com">Magdrive</a> has just closed a £1.4M seed round led by Founders Fund, an early investor in SpaceX, backed by Luminous Ventures, 7percent Ventures, and Entrepreneur First.</p>
<p>Magdrive is developing a next generation of spacecraft propulsion for small satellites. The startup says its engine’s thrust and efficiency are a &#8220;generational leap&#8221; ahead of any other electrical thrusters, opening up the space industry to completely new types of missions that were not possible before, without resorting to much larger, expensive and heavier chemical thrusters. It says its engine would make fast and affordable interplanetary space travel possible, as well as operations in Very Low Earth orbit. The engine would also make orbital manufacturing far more possible than previously.</p>
<p>Existing electrical solutions are very efficient but have very low thrust. Chemical thrusters have high thrust but lack efficiency and are hazardous and expensive to handle. Magdrive says its engine can deliver both high thrust and high efficiency in one system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2088476" style="width: 407px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088476" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png" alt="Magdrive prototype render" width="397" height="377" class="size-full wp-image-2088476" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png 397w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png?resize=150,142 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png?resize=300,285 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088476" class="wp-caption-text">Magdrive prototype render</p></div></p>
<p>If it works, the Magdrive engine could make spacecraft go faster for longer. This could open up the industry to new space missions, such as a satellite (or X-wing fighter?) that can make multiple, fast maneuvers, without worrying about conserving fuel. In order to do this right now, satellites require a chemical thruster, which requires a significant payload in fuel for launch. A 200kg satellite would require 50kg of hydrazine fuel, which would cost £1,350,000 in launch mass alone.</p>
<p>Co-founder (and Star Trek fan) Dr Thomas Clayson did a PhD in plasma physics, working on advanced electromagnetic fields. He realized this could be a cornerstone for developing a plasma thruster that could achieve the accelerations required for interplanetary space travel. After meeting Mark Stokes, a mechanical engineer at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/imperial-college-london" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="imperial-college-london">Imperial College London <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with similar dreams of space travel, they decided to build a small scale thruster for satellites.</p>
<p>But Magdrive is not alone. Other companies are developing so-called &#8216;Hall Effect Thrusters&#8217;, which is a technology that has existed since the 1960’s. Much of the development is towards miniaturization and mass reduction, but thrust and efficiency remain the same. These companies include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/busek" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="busek">Busek, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Exotrail, Apollo Fusion, Enpusion, Nanoavionics. Meanwhile, large international companies with huge technology portfolios are working on improving chemical propulsion and making it non-toxic to handle, such as Aerojet Rocketdyne and Moog ISP.</p>
<p>They plan to scale up our technology to power larger manned spacecraft (once in orbit) to long-distance destinations such as the Moon and Mars. Our system would present a much more affordable than a chemical or nuclear solution, due to the huge reduction in fuel costs, and because it is reusable.</p>
<p>Andrew J Scott, Founding Partner, 7percent Ventures: “At 7percent we seek founding teams with &#8216;moonshot&#8217; ambitions. With Magdrive this is not just a metaphor: their revolutionary plasma thruster will soon be powering satellites, but in the future could take us to deep space. While the UK&#8217;s expertise in constructing satellites is world-renowned, there has been far less focus on propulsion. In fact, Great Britain is the only country to have successfully developed and then, in the 1970&#8217;s abandoned, an indigenous satellite launch capability, which undoubtedly curbed the UK&#8217;s space sector. So we&#8217;re excited to be backing Magdrive, one of a new generation of British space startups, which has the vision and ambition to become a world-beating company in this burgeoning sector.”</p>
<p>The satellite industry is worth $5 Billion in 2020, predicted to grow to USD$30Billion by 2030, due to the rise in mega-constellations. Some 5,000 satellites are due to be launched in the next two years and 75% of all the companies launching these satellites have already flown something in space.</p>
<p>Magdrive is at the European Space Agency Business Incubation Centre in Harwell, Oxford.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a major upswing in virtual learning &#8212; where some schools have gone (and stayed) remote, and others have incorporated significantly stronger online components, in order to help communities maintain more social distancing. That has in turn led to a surge in the usage of tools to help home learners do their work better, and today, one of them is announcing a growth round that speaks to the opportunity in that market.</p>
<p><a href="https://brainly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainly</a>, a startup from Poland that has built a popular network for students and their parents to engage with each other for advice and help with homework questions, has raised $80 million, a series D that it will be using both to continue building out the tools that it offers to students as well as to hone in on expansion in some key emerging markets such as Indonesia and Brazil. The news comes on the heels of dramatic growth for the company, which has seen its user base grow from 150 million users in 2019 to 350 million today.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by previous backer Learn Capital, with past investors <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/prosus-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="prosus-ventures">Prosus Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/runa-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="runa-capital">Runa Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> MantaRay, and General Catalyst Partners also participating. The company has now raised some $150 million and while it&#8217;s not disclosing valuation, CEO and co-founder Michał Borkowski confirmed it is &#8220;definitely&#8221; an upround for the company. For more context, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/brainly-a-crowdsourced-homework-helper-for-students-raises-30m-to-expand-in-the-us/">Pitchbook estimates</a> that the company was valued at $180 million in its last round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/brainly-a-crowdsourced-homework-helper-for-students-raises-30m-to-expand-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Series C of $30 million in 2019</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That C round was raised specifically to help <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/brainly-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="brainly-com">Brainly <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> grow in the U.S. It currently has some 30 million users in that market, and it happens to be the only one in which Brainly is monetising users. Everywhere else, Brainly is currently free to use. (In the U.S. there are also some formidable competitors, like Chegg, which has <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamBlacker25/status/1339546254922158081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong traction</a> in the market of helping students with homework, with some 74% of Chegg&#8217;s user spend concentrated in that one single country.)</p>
<p>“Brainly has become one of the world’s largest learning communities, achieving significant organic growth in over 35 countries,” said Vinit Sukhija, Partner at Learn Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2088466" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="471" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png 6500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=1536,1063 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=2048,1418 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, Brainly was finding an audience with students &#8212; primarily those aged 13-19, said Borkowski &#8212; who were turning to the service to connect with people who could help them with homework when they found themselves at an impasse with, say, a math problem or getting to grips with the sequence of events that led to the revolutions of 1848. The platform is open-ended and is a little like a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quora" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quora">Quora <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for homework, in that people can find and answer questions they are interested in, as well as ask questions themselves.</p>
<p>That platform, however, took on a whole new dimension of importance with the shift to virtual learning, Borkowski said.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;In the western world, online education wasn’t a big investment area [pre-Covid] and that has changed a lot, with huge adoption by students, parents and teachers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But that big transition, switching from offline to online, has left kids struggling because teachers have so much more to do, so they can&#8217;t engage in the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>So with &#8220;homework&#8221; becoming &#8220;all work&#8221;, that has effectively led to needing more help than ever with home studies. And while many parents have tried to get more involved to make up the difference, &#8220;having parents as teachers has been hard,&#8221; he added. They may have been taught differently from how their kids are learning, or they don&#8217;t remember or know answers.</p>
<p>One thing that Brainly started to see, he said, was that with the pandemic more parents started using the app alongside students, either to work out answers together or to get the help themselves before helping their kids, with a number of these being from parents of kids younger than 13. He said that 15-20% of all new registrations currently are coming from parents.</p>
<p>Brainly up to now has been mainly focused on how to build out more tools for the students &#8212; and now parents &#8212; that use it, and has so far been about organic growth for those communities.</p>
<p>However, there is clearly scope to expand that to more educational stakeholders to better organise what kind of questions are answered and how. Borkowski said that the company has indeed been approached by educators, those building curriculums and others so that answers might tie in better with the kinds of questions that they are most likely to ask of students, although for now the company &#8220;wants to keep the focus on students and parents getting stuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of future products, Brainly is looking at ways of bringing in more tutoring, video and AI into the mix. The AI aspect is very interesting and will in fact tie in to wider curriculum coverage based on more localised needs.</p>
<p>For example, if you ask for help with a particular kind of quadratic equation technique, you can then be served lots of same practice questions to help better learn and apply what you&#8217;ve just been learning, and you might even then get suggested related topics that will appear alongside that in a wider mathematics examination. And, you might be offered the chance to meet with a tutor for further help.</p>
<p>Tutoring, he said, is something that Brainly has already been quietly piloting and has run some 150,000 sessions to date. Having such a large user base, Borkowski said, helps the startup run services at scale while still effectively keeping them in test mode.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It will be about looking at what students are studying and how to map that to the curriculum in the country, and what we can do to help with that.&#8221; Borkowski said. &#8220;But it will require a heavy lift and and machine learning to pinpoint students&#8221; for it to work properly, which is one reason it has yet to roll it out more comprehensively, he added.</p>
<p>Tutoring and more personalization are not the only areas where Brainly is actively testing out new services.</p>
<p>The company is also creating more space for adding in video to demonstrate different techniques (which I suspect is especially good for something like mathematics, but equally helpful for, say, an art technique). This is presumably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/brainly-bask/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in part based on a 2018 acquisition the startup made to bring on more video tools</a>, which underscores in some ways how deliberate Brainly&#8217;s expansion strategy has been.</p>
<p>There are &#8220;thousands per week&#8221; being added already, but as with tutoring &#8220;that, for us, is a testing stage,&#8221; added Borkowski. There should be more coming in Q1 about new products, he said.</p>

Our vision is to make it accessible to anyone to gain a skill and a certification capable of setting you on the path of a well-paid career that you love,&#8221; said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/blake-garrett" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="blake-garrett">Blake Garrett, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Aceable&#8217;s founder and chief executive. &#8220;We see <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hggc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hggc">HGGC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as a strategic, long-term financial partner that embraces and accelerates our vision to create unparalleled education experiences that make it accessible for people to change their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other startups have also landed tens of millions of dollars to capture this newfound interest in reskilling or upskilling. In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/degreed-lands-new-cash-for-upskilling-in-a-down-market/">Degreed raised $32 million for its own spin on the edtech market</a>. But there&#8217;s still some question over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/reskilling-upskilling-future-of-edtech/">who benefits from these new platforms</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AAUyKZ1gtB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/reskilling-upskilling-future-of-edtech/">Who really benefits from reskilling?</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s possible that Aceable could exist along a continuum with some of these other platforms, or serve communities that aren&#8217;t addressed by the current options on the market.</p>
<p>As the company notes, one in four working professionals takes license and certification training a year &#8212; and these classes are often the gatekeeper to greater financial success.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are big believers in Aceable&#8217;s mission and their long track record of success in developing mobile-first education technology,&#8221; said John Block, Partner at HGGC. &#8220;Our investment reinforces our confidence in the team and will allow Aceable to grow to the next level while helping people achieve the life they want through continuing education.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aceable now counts more than 2,200 hours of educational content on its platform, which have been used to train 13 million students across 36 states. The company was first spun up from the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Capital Factory accelerator program and has raised its cash from investors including Sageview Capital, Silverton Partners, Floodgate Fund, Next Coast Venture Partners, Wildcat VC, Nextgen Partners and now HGGC.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://photoroom.com">PhotoRoom</a> is launching its app on Android today. The company has been working on a utility photography app that lets you remove the background from a photo, swaps it for another background and tweaks your photo.</p>
<p>And it’s been working well on iOS already as the company attended Y Combinator, doubled its annual recurring revenue to $2 million and raised a $1.2 million seed round.</p>
<p>In particular, influencers and people reselling clothes and fashion items have been relying on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/photoroom" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="photoroom">PhotoRoom <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. They use their phone as their main creativity platform. Like other professional photography apps, the startup relies on subscriptions to generate revenue ($9.49 per month or $46.99 per year).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PhotoRoom relies on machine learning to identify objects and separate them from the rest of the photo. This way, you can manipulate a specific part of your photo.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088173" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088173" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png" alt="" width="1024" height="619" class="size-full wp-image-2088173" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png 1420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=768,464 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088173" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PhotoRoom</p></div></p>
<p>When the startup raised its seed round after Y Combinator, it chose to raise from Nicolas Wittenborn’s Adjacent fund, Liquid2 Ventures as well as two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group of business angels focused on machine learning, such as Yann LeCun (Chief AI Scientist at Facebook), Zehan Wang (Head of Twitter Machine Learning Cortex, co-founder of Magic Poney), Nicolas Pinto (Perceptio founder), etc.</li>
<li>And another group of business angels focused on mobile subscriptions, such as Holger Seim (Blinkist), Jacob Eiting (RevenueCat), John Bonten (advisor for Calm and Spotify) and Eric Setton (Tango).</li>
</ul>
<p>With this funding round, the company plans to grow the team from 3 to 8 persons and work on its deep learning algorithm. If you want to learn more about PhotoRoom, feel free to read my take on the product:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://betterdairy.co.uk/">Better Dairy</a>, a U.K. startup developing animal-free dairy that was founded out of Entrepreneur First (EF), has picked up £1.6 million in seed funding. The London-based company is currently in the R&amp;D stages of developing products that are &#8220;molecularly identical&#8221; to traditional dairy without using animals as part of the production process.</p>
<p>This seed round was led by Happiness Capital, alongside a number of other investors in the space. They include CPT Capital, Stray Dog Capital and Veg Capital, in addition to various unnamed angel investors. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/better-dairy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="better-dairy">Better Dairy <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says it will use the funds to accelerate its R&amp;D efforts with the aim of commercialising its first products by early 2022.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Jevan Nagarajah (CEO) and Dr. Christopher Reynolds (CTO), both alumni of Imperial College London but who paired up during EF’s company builder program, Better Dairy is using advancements in technology to address the hugely unsustainable dairy market. Nagarajah has plenty of tech company experience, including stints at Rocket Internet, SumUp, and Ritua, as well as founding early ‘dark kitchen’ startup ShareDining. Meanwhile, Reynolds holds a PhD and a number of post-doctorates across bioinformatics and synthetic biology, and has a degree in natural sciences spanning chemistry and biochemistry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nagarajah says animal-based dairy farming is “hugely unsustainable,” noting that it emits the equivalent of over 1.7 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year and it takes 650 litres of water to produce just 1 litre of milk. “Dairy products themselves contain several unwanted pollutants such as growth hormones and antibiotics by virtue of the process of milking mothering cows and are thus not the most suitable for human consumption,” he adds.</p>
<p>However, although plant based alternatives are gaining popularity, Nagarajah argues that they are not a complete solution, often lacking in flavour, texture and nutritional profile. And while they might be able to capture market share, he doesn’t believe plant based alternatives to dairy will be successful in “radically” disrupting the existing $700 billion dairy industry and supply chain. That’s where Better Dairy comes in.</p>
<p>“We are instead using yeast fermentation and biology to produce products that are molecularly identical to traditional dairy,” he explains. “We follow a process very similar to beer brewing but the end result in our case is large vats of dairy instead of beer. This production process, while seemingly futuristic, is actually already being used to produce several enzymes for food production, for example rennet, as well as to produce numerous medical products such as insulin, so we are just building on this”.</p>
<p>Better Dairy is still early on in its R&amp;D process, but has already managed to produce its first dairy samples in the lab. The first challenge was to manipulate yeast to produce initial dairy proof of concepts. “Following this, we believe we have identified a clear path to get us to commercially viable products,” says Nagarajah. “While some of our milestones are box ticking exercises, for example the scaling up of our manufacturing capabilities, the major challenges we need to overcome revolve around the optimisation of our end to end production process”.</p>
<p>That’s because, explains the Better Dairy co-founder, dairy is a relatively low cost good. To realistically disrupt the existing dairy market, the startup will need to achieve a certain level of efficiency otherwise it risks succeeding in producing better dairy but will still fail overall due to prohibitively high pricing.</p>
<p>“We are initially focused on dairy proteins with the view of extending our range to fats over time,” says Nagarajah. “The main dairy proteins whey and casein have many structural and nutritional benefits and are used as ingredients across thousands of food products. They are crucial in providing the texture of dairy products like cheese but are also used heavily in soups and ready meals, baked goods and pastries, chocolates and sweets and also pasta and bread. They even find their way into products like beef burgers and chicken nuggets to bolster protein content and add texture.</p>
<p>“While our intention was initially to enable a wave of better dairy products, our ambitions have grown to target the disruption of the entire dairy supply chain across dairy and non-dairy categories. Our vision is to create a world where humans are vegan without even realising it”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a>, the London fintech that aims to become the one-stop shop globally for businesses that want to let customers pay via recurring bank payments, has raised $95 million in Series F funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/12/14/gocardless-secures-billion-dollar-valuation-raising-95m/">According to The Telegraph newspaper</a>, this gives the company much coveted unicorn status. However, I understand the round values GoCardless at just over $970 million, meaning that the 2011-founded fintech is perhaps best described as a soonicorn (presuming these things are important to you).</p>
<p>The latest fundraise was led by Bain Capital Ventures, and follows 46% year-on-year growth for GoCardless as it benefits from an increase in e-commerce and online payments generally during the pandemic. It brings the total raised by the company to-date to $240 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GoCardless says it will use the funding to accelerate its open banking strategy, which will see it combine open banking-enabled bank-to-bank payments with the global bank debit payments network it has already built out. “For the first time, merchants will be able to access the best of both worlds for recurring payments: Instant open banking payments will provide visibility and speed, while bank debit maximises cash flow and minimises churn by pulling funds automatically from payers &#8211; all at a lower cost than cards,” pitches the fintech.</p>
<p>In addition &#8212; and noteworthy &#8212; GoCardless says it will also expand its offering into the “adjacent e-commerce market” to launch a simple and secure way of making open banking-enabled bank-to-bank payments as a lower-cost alternative to cards.</p>
<p>The company has always pitched direct debits as a much better recurring payments method, especially for subscription commerce and regular B2B payments. That’s because, amongst other things, debit and credit cards expire, breaking any subsequent recurring payments. By adding bank-to-bank payments to its stack, GoCardless is continuing to push up against the card network duopoly of Visa and Mastercard.</p>
<p>“We think the magic is in the combination of open banking payments and our existing direct debit platform,” co-founder and CEO Hiroki Takeuchi tells me, when asked why GoCardless is entering the soon to be commoditized space of open banking payments.</p>
<p>“They are really complimentary as open banking is faster and more secure but direct debit is more flexible and more reliable. The combination will create something entirely new and unique that will not only make our product better for our existing customers but also enable us to go after new markets”.</p>
<p>He says that GoCardless already has the required FCA permissions to do open banking payments, and new products are actively under development. Debut products will be launching in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>“We have been following open banking very closely but we felt it wasn’t reliable enough or slick enough for payments until quite recently,” adds Takeuchi. “This has been changing and we think now is the perfect time to focus on open banking payments”.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of open banking is that the U.K. regulator is currently consulting with the industry on plans to make recurring payments possible via open banking, meaning that they could be used instead of direct debits. Arguably, GoCardless’ biggest moat is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/goamerica/">the global recurring payments network</a> it has built, and so I put it to Takeuchi that open banking is both an opportunity and a threat to GoCardless.</p>
<p>“We don&#8217;t worry about this &#8211; we are agnostic to the rails we build on,” he says, pushing back. “What we care about is getting money from one bank account to another as efficiently as possible. In fact, we processed the first (and I think maybe the only) variable recurring payment via open banking last year as part of a test we worked on with the open banking team.</p>
<p>“If open banking offers rails that replicate direct debit then we will adopt those. The reality is that the payment itself is only a small part of the overall value we provide for our merchants &#8212; there are a lot of other basics such as reconciliation, refunds, international settlement, FX etc. that are really important &#8212; so we are confident that there is still a lot for us to do”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are over 600 million internet users in India, but only a fraction of this population is fluent in English. Most online services and much of the content on the web currently, however, are available exclusively in English.</p>
<p>This language barrier continues to contribute to a digital divide in the world’s second largest internet market that has limited hundreds of millions of users’ rendition of the world wide web to a select few websites and services.</p>
<p>So it comes as no surprise that American tech giants, which are counting on emerging markets such as India to continue their growth. are increasingly attempting to make the web and their services accessible to more people.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Case in point: A feature that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> provides to quickly translate the content of a web page from English to Indian languages has been used more than 17 billion times by users in India in the past year.</p>
<p>Google, which has so far led this effort, on Thursday unveiled some of its new efforts. The company &#8212; which counts India as its biggest market by users, and this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">committed to invest more than $10 billion in the country</a> over the coming years &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">said it plans to invest more in machine learning and AI efforts at Google&#8217;s research center in India and make its AI models accessible to everyone across the ecosystem. The company </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">also plans to partner with local startups that are serving users in local languages, and &#8220;drastically&#8221; improve the experience of Google products and services for Indian language users.</span></p>
<p>On that last part, the company today announced a range of changes it is rolling out across some of its services to make them speak more local languages and unveiled a whole new approach it’s taking to translate languages.</p>
<h2>Product changes</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2088428" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1.gif" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<p>Users will now be able to see search results to their queries in Tamil, Telugu, Bangla, and Marathi, in addition to English and Hindi that are currently available. The addition comes four years after Google added the Hindi tab to the search page in India. The company said the volume of search queries in Hindi grew more than 10 times after the introduction of this tab. If someone prefers to see their query in Tamil, for instance, now they will be able to set Tamil tab next to English and quickly toggle between the two.</p>
<p>Getting search results in a local language is helpful, but often people want to make their queries in those languages as well. Google says it has found that typing in non-English language is another challenge users face today. “As a result, many users search in English even if they really would prefer to see results in a local language they understand,” the company said.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, Search will start to show relevant content in supported Indian languages where appropriate even if the local language query is typed in English. The feature, which the company plans to roll out over the next month, supports five Indian languages: Hindi, Bangla, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical alignnone size-full wp-image-2088426" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.gif" alt="" width="300" height="583" /></p>
<p>Google is also making it easier for users to quickly change the preferred language in which they see results in an app without altering the device’s language settings. The feature, which is currently available in Discover and Google Assistant, will now roll out in Maps. Maps supports 9 Indian languages.</p>
<p>Similarly, Google Lens’s Homework feature, which allows users to take a picture of a math or science problem and then delivers its answer and walks students through the steps on how to get there, now supports Hindi language. India is the biggest market for Google Lens, said Nidhi Gupta, Senior Product Manager at Google India, at the event.</p>
<p>Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst at consultancy firm Convergence Catalyst, said the new feature of Google Lens could pose a threat to some Indian startups such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/two-year-old-indian-edtech-startup-doubtnut-raises-15m/">Sequoia Capital-backed Doubtnut</a> that operates in a similar space.</p>
<h2>MuRIL</h2>
<p>Google executives also detailed a new language AI model, which they are calling <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/MuRIL/1">Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages</a> (MuRIL), that delivers more efficiency and accuracy in handling transliteration, spelling variations and mixed languages and other nuances of languages. MuRIL provides support for transliterated text when writing Hindi using Roman script, which was something missing from previous models of its kind, said Partha Talukdar, Research Scientist at Google Research India, at a virtual event Thursday.</p>
<p>The company said it trained the new model with articles on Wikipedia and texts from a dataset called Common Crawl. It also trained it on transliterated text from, among other sources, Wikipedia (fed through Google&#8217;s existing neural machine translation models). The result is that MuRIL handles Indian languages better than previous, more general language models and can contend with letters and words that have been transliterated &#8212; that is, Google is using the closest corresponding letters of a different alphabet or script.</p>
<p>Talukdar noted that the previous model Google relied on proved unscalable as the company had to build model for each language separately. &#8220;Building such language specific modeling for each and every task is not resource efficient as we often don&#8217;t have training data for tasks like this,&#8221; he said. MuRIL significantly outperforms the earlier model &#8212; by 10% on native text and 27% on transliterated text. MuRIL, which was developed by Google executives in India and is being in use for about a year, is now open source.</p>

<p>One of the many tasks MuRIL is good at, is determining the sentiment of the sentence. For example, “Achha hua account bandh nahi hua” would previously be interpreted as having a negative meaning, but MuRIL correctly identifies this as a positive statement, said Talukdar. Or take the ability to classify a person versus a place: ‘Shirdi ke sai baba’ would previously be interpreted as a place, which is wrong, but MuRIL correctly interprets it as a person.</p>

<p><a href="https://waresix.com/">Waresix</a>, one of Indonesia’s largest logistics startups, has acquired <a href="https://trukita.com/">Trukita</a>, a company that focuses on the &#8220;first mile.&#8221; The term refers to the part of the supply chain where goods are transported from ports to warehouses.</p>
<p>Both Waresix and Trukita operate by connecting businesses to shippers and warehouses, and the acquisition will enable them to lower customer costs. While Waresix&#8217;s platform digitizes all parts of the supply and logistics chain, its current focus is on mid-mile logistics services, or transportation from warehouses to distributors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Trukita has an extended network of over 10,000 trucks, and the combination of the two companies means it is &#8220;now one of the largest logistics technology providers in Indonesia,&#8221; said co-founder and chief executive officer Andree Susanto.</p>

<p>Waresix, which recently announced it <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/indonesian-logistics-tech-startup-waresix-closes-cus100-million-fundraising-301126991.html">raised $100 million</a> in funding over the past year from investors like EV Growth, Jungle Ventures and SoftBank Ventures Asia, works with more than 375 warehouses and 40,000 trucks across Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country. It currently serves about 100 cities.</p>
<p>Indonesia’s geography creates unique challenges for logistics companies, especially those operating outside of major cities. It is an archipelago made up of more than 17,500 islands, of which 6,000 are inhabited. This means supply chains often span ships, trucks and several warehouses before goods make it to their final destination. The high costs of logistics has a sizable impact on Indonesia’s economy and the <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/09/28/govt-to-proceed-with-logistics-system-reform-amid-high-costs.html">government is currently engaged in an initiative </a>to develop more infrastructure, integrate databases and simplify export-import licensing.</p>
<p>Indonesia’s complicated logistics landscape has given rise to startups like Waresix, Kargo and Ritase, which focus on removing middlemen, managing shipments in real-time and using data analytics to uncover inefficiencies in the supply chain.</p>
<p>Trukita was founded in 2017, and its investors include Astra International, EverHaüs and Plug and Play.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No one likes having to go to the automotive repair shop. There&#8217;s little transparency into what happens after a car is dropped off, invoices are often little more than a series of illegible bullet points, and the ordeal can feel chaotic.</p>
<p><a href="https://autoleap.com/">AutoLeap</a>, a six-month-old, Toronto-based startup that quietly raised $5 million in seed funding in September, thinks its team can figure out how to repair that broken experience by bringing car repair shops into the 21st century at long last. Its big idea is to help such shops organize their operations, schedule jobs, order parts, conduct digital inspections, and invoice customers in a transparent and seamless way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first to try to modernize the car repair process. Among other startups, a five-year-old, Seattle-based outfit, Wrench, has already raised <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/wrench-raises-20m-ratchet-growth-tech-powered-car-repair-platform/">$40 million</a> toward that end, while another entrant, <a href="https://www.repairsmith.com/">RepairSmith</a>, a two-year-old, L.A.-based car repair and maintenance service, is backed by Daimler.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, with a global automotive repair market that&#8217;s currently valued at $700 billion, there&#8217;s clearly room for more than one player and one approach, and AutoLeap has a few things going for it.</p>
<p>For starters, it has an investor base with some useful connections. Threshold Ventures, which led AutoLeap&#8217;s seed round, has ties to the automotive world, including through its bet on the car-selling platform <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shiftcars" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shiftcars">Shift, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2020/10/16/586738.htm">went public</a> in October via a reverse merger.</p>
<p>AutoLeap &#8212; whose other venture investors include Maple VC, Liquid2 Ventures, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/global-founders-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="global-founders-capital">Global Founders Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Codename Ventures &#8212; is also backed by some notable individuals that hold sway in the world that AutoLeap is entering. Among them: Shift cofounder George Arison, former General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner, and former senior Bridgestone exec Ned Aguilar.</p>
<p>More importantly, AutoLeap&#8217;s founders worked together once before to reinvigorate a stodgy business. Before launching AutoLeap, co-CEOs Rameez Ansari and Steve Lau spent four years as the co-CEOs of <a href="https://fieldedge.com/">FieldEdge</a>, a SaaS company that helps contractors to run their small businesses.</p>
<p>They two &#8212; college friends who&#8217;d met at the University of Toronto &#8212; didn&#8217;t start the company. Rather, after Lau nabbed an MBA from Wharton and Ansari nabbed his from Stanford, they joined forces to acquire and grow a neglected business after raising a so-called <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/centers-initiatives/ces/research/search-funds">search fund</a>. (If you aren&#8217;t familiar, it&#8217;s vehicle that&#8217;s backed by individual investors who bet on a team to find a company to buy, run it for some period of time, then sell it for far more money.)</p>
<p>It was a productive experience for all involved. After spending $20 million to acquire FieldEdge, whose software had already been around for 30 years, Lau and Ansari so dramatically improved the company&#8217;s offerings that they were able to charge seven times what the company had previously collected for its products, says Lau. Then they<a href="https://www.adventinternational.com/advent-international-acquires-merges-clearent-fieldedge-create-integrated-payments-leader/"> sold</a> it to the private equity firm Advent in 2018 for &#8220;north of $100 million,&#8221; says Lau.</p>
<p>It was a solid exit. Minus that $20 million investment, the team kept 30% of the remaining proceeds from FieldEdge&#8217;s sale, with the rest going to the search fund&#8217;s investors.</p>
<p>Even so, says Lau, he and Ansari might have kept going if not for rival <a href="https://www.servicetitan.com/">ServiceTitan</a>, which &#8220;went crazy on the fundraising front.&#8221; (The seven-year-old company has raised $400 million altogether from investors.)</p>
<p>Between ServiceTitan&#8217;s daunting war chest and &#8220;given this was a first exit for us,&#8221; Lau says, &#8220;we transitioned out instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, neither Lau nor Ansari wants to repeat the scenario with AutoLeap. Indeed, though Lau says the company is &#8220;heads down&#8221; and &#8220;not in any discussions&#8221; with investors now that it has secured seed funding, one imagines it won&#8217;t take long for that to change.</p>
<p>What investors would be funding essentially is a burgeoning software platform that aims to kill off paper flyers, crumbling fax machines, and sheaves of invoices &#8212; if only it can convince car repair shops to slow down long enough to try its software.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t a no-brainer that they will, admits Lau. &#8220;It&#8217;s a material onboarding effort, because you become the lifeblood of their business.&#8221; The sales process also requires convincing the shops to share their existing data and take the time required to be trained on how to use it.</p>
<p>Lau isn&#8217;t dissuaded, plainly. He says the time to onboard a new customer is one to two weeks and that &#8220;once they start seeing value, they get that &#8216;aha&#8217; type of moment.&#8221; In fact, he says that <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">AutoLeap is already working with a handful of shops, including several in Toronto, one in Las Vegas, and another in Boston.</span></p>
<p>As for its expansion plans, Lau says that some of the company&#8217;s seed funding will go toward digital marketing, but it&#8217;s also relying heavily on word of mouth. It helps, he says, that garages are often clustered in a geographic area, which he believes will enable AutoLeap to spread quickly.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t &#8220;a lot of data&#8221; to support that assumption, offers Lau. But if AutoLeap has its way, there will be soon enough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s embattled coffee delivery startup Luckin has reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay a $180 million penalty to settle charges that it overstated its revenues, expenses, and losses by the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The announcement by the market regulator <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-luckin-coffee-to-pay-180-million-to-settle-accounting-fraud-claims-11608157731">arrived</a> Wednesday evening, months after short-seller Muddy Waters first reported the alleged fraud early this year. In response to the allegations, Luckin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/luckin-coffees-board-initiates-investigation-into-300m-potential-fraud/">said</a> in April it would launch an internal probe. In June, the SEC said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/luckin-coffee-will-unluckinly-delist-from-nasdaq-following-fraud-allegations/">would delist Luckin</a>, and in July, Luckin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/after-grinding-investigation-luckin-coffee-confirms-300-million-revenue-fraud/">admitted</a> it did cook its books.</p>
<p>The fiasco came only a year after Luckin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/chinas-luckin-coffee-raises-up-to-651m-in-upsized-us-ipo/">raised $651 million</a> through its first time sale on Nasdaq. The company was founded in October 2017, making it one of the fastest companies to go from a startup to a public company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which aspired to take a piece of Starbucks&#8217; sizable market share in China, allegedly fabricated more than $300 million in sales between at least April 2019 through January 2020, said the SEC announcement. Certain employees were found attempting to conceal the fraud by inflating the firm&#8217;s expenses by more than $190 million, &#8220;creating a fake operations database, and altering accounting and bank records to reflect the false sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckin neither admitted or denied these claims, which were filed in a court in the Southern District of New York. The settlement is subject to court approval and the transfer of funds to security holders will<span id="textmarker_16" class="textmarker textmarker_16"> need approval by Chinese authorities.</span></p>
<p>In September, China&#8217;s market regulator <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-coffee-investigation-fine/china-fines-luckin-coffee-and-linked-firms-a-total-of-9-million-idUSKCN26D07G">fined Luckin and 45 companies involved in Luckin&#8217;s frauds</a> a total of $9 million after an investigation revealed the coffee company faked its numbers.</p>
<p>Despite the fraudulent scandal, Luckin claims business is still as usual. Operations of the firm and its stores are currently &#8220;stable and normal,&#8221; said the company in a notice on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luckin will continue to cooperate with regulators and prioritize compliance. In the meantime, our management and staff will continue to ensure the firm&#8217;s stable operation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Short-sellers have been going after U.S.-listed Chinese firms this year. A <a href="https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/iq-netflix-of-china-good-luckin/">report</a> from Wolfpack Research accused iQiyi, a major Chinese video streaming service backed by Baidu, of inflating its numbers, a claim that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/iqiyi-sec-investigation-into-fraud-allegations-shares-plunge.html">triggered an SEC probe</a>. GSX Techedu, a Chinese after-school tutoring company, was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-probes-chinas-gsx-techedu-after-short-sellers-pleas-11599046396">under a similar SEC investigation</a> after short-seller Citron Research said the company fabricated sales numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there are challenges in our ability to effectively hold foreign issuers and their officers and directors accountable to the same extent as U.S. issuers and persons, we will continue to use all our available resources to protect investors when foreign issuers violate the federal securities laws,&#8221; said Stephanie Avakian, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, in the regulator&#8217;s announcement on Luckin.</p>

He joined Accel as a venture partner <a href="https://accel.com/noteworthy/welcoming-amit-jhawar-to-accel-as-a-venture-partner">in July</a> and he’s going to join Lydia’s board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jhawar joined payments company Braintree in 2011 as COO and CFO. Shortly after, Braintree acquired peer-to-peer payment app Venmo. “When we acquired Venmo it was only 15 people. They had just released their mobile app in April of 2012,” Jhawar told me in a phone interview.</p>
<p>PayPal later acquired Braintree and Venmo — Jhawar stuck around until early 2020 to scale Venmo to the huge fintech consumer app that 52 million people use in the U.S. Jhawar believes that peer-to-peer payments represent the beginning of a long-term consumer relationship.</p>

<p>“You know that P2P is successful when they leave money in their account because they’re going to come back,” he said.</p>
<p>Back in 2014, when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/24/lydia-is-a-fee-free-payment-app-thats-like-venmo-for-france/">I first covered Lydia</a>, I called it the Venmo for France — they had only raised €600,000 back then. It seems like Jhawar agrees with that take. Since then, Lydia has grown quite a lot and has expanded beyond peer-to-peer payments in various ways.</p>
<p>With Lydia, you can send money to another user in just a few seconds. You don’t have to enter an account number in your banking app — as long as you know their phone number, they’ll receive your payment.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lydia partners with Tink to improve open banking features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/lydia-partners-with-tink-to-improve-open-banking-features/embed/#?secret=kfbluqjU39" data-secret="kfbluqjU39" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>If you have money in your account, you can choose to spend it directly using a Visa debit card. Lydia lets you generate a virtual card that works with Apple Pay and Google Pay — you can also order a plastic card.</p>
<p>Lydia also supports direct deposit as you get your own IBAN in the app. You can also create money pots and send a link to other users, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/lydia-partners-with-tink-to-improve-open-banking-features/">view your bank accounts</a> in Lydia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/lydia-lets-you-donate-to-hospitals-and-charities/">donate</a> money to hospitals and charities, get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/05/lydia-expands-credit-offering-in-partnership-with-younited-credit/">a credit line</a>, etc.</p>
<p>But there’s one killer feature that stands out over the rest. Bank accounts tend to be monolithic and don’t reflect how you use money. “If you look at banks today, they call the main account a checking account. It’s outdated by design,” CEO Cyril Chiche said.</p>
<p>Lydia has created flexible sub-accounts that you can use in many different ways. You can create a second sub-account and set some money aside for your bills. You can create a third one and share it with a few friends because you’re going on a vacation together.</p>

<p>You can move money from one account to another by swiping your finger across the account grid. As you can have multiple contributors and you can change the account associated with your debit card, it means that money flows more naturally. It feels like using a messaging app, not a financial app.</p>
<p>And it’s been working well in France. The company now has more than 4 million users. Transactions have doubled over the past year, which means that usage is accelerating.</p>
<p>“Lydia has the largest P2P network in Europe outside of PayPal and has the potential to grow all across Europe with a mobile-first, customer-focused solution. This will bring demand for incremental consumer financial products and high merchant interest to accept the payment,” Jhawar told me in an email.</p>
<p>And 2020 has been a busy year for Lydia. The company has just released a complete redesign to better position the app as a super app for financial services. All the interactions and all the main tabs have been changed.</p>
<p>Lydia also re-launched its premium offering with two new premium plans that offer you higher limits over the free plan and an insurance package for the most expensive offer. Those plans are more in line with what the app offers today and should contribute to the company’s bottom line. “The next step is bringing Lydia to profitability and it’s something that has always been important for us,” Chiche said in a recent interview.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SGVTghCPsA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/lydia-lets-you-donate-to-hospitals-and-charities/">Lydia lets you donate to hospitals and charities</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Behind the scenes, Lydia has also upgraded many core features, such as migrating cards to a new infrastructure, adding alerts to account aggregation, supporting instant SEPA transfers to bank accounts, etc.</p>
<p>In 2021, the company plans to build on top of that new foundation with more financial products. “We’re going to try every single product — credit, savings, investment,” Chiche said.</p>
<p>The company is also slowly expanding to more countries. But it wants to offer a product that feels like a local product with a local card and a local IBAN to increase acceptance rates. Lydia is starting with Portugal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> takes aim at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Texas sues Google and we interview the CEO of Boston Dynamics.

<p><strong>The big story: Facebook escalates Apple criticism</strong></p>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">took a big swing</a> at Apple&#8217;s upcoming app tracking restrictions today with full-page ads in the print editions of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post that argued the social networking giant is &#8220;standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, while Facebook will obviously be affected by Apple&#8217;s change (apps will have to ask users for permission before it can track their IDFA identifier, which will presumably lead to a steep drop in ad targeting), the company said that small businesses relying on targeted ad campaigns will be hurt even more.</p>
<p>And while the two campaigns are very different, it&#8217;s worth noting that another initiative against Apple is also gaining steam, with major U.S. news publishers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/major-u-s-news-publishers-join-the-coalition-for-app-fairness-advocacy-group-to-fight-the-apple-tax/">joining the Coalition for App Fairness</a>, a group fighting app store fees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It took an unusually long time, but <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hbo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hbo">HBO <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Max is set to launch on Roku devices tomorrow.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roku" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roku">Roku <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> users make up a <a href="https://www.whattowatch.com/news/rokus-earnings">massive </a>chunk of the cord-cutting market, so the absence of an HBO Max app for Roku nearly seven months after the service launched was pretty glaring. We&#8217;d been wondering where the Max app was for months, its launch seemingly tied up over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/hbo-max-reached-4-1m-subscribers-in-first-month-despite-lack-of-distribution-on-roku-and-fire-tv/">matter of where and how customers could subscribe</a>.</p>
<p>With &#8220;Wonder Woman 1984&#8221; set to debut on Max in just a few weeks, one can assume there was tremendous pressure all around to get the deal done. As part of the deal, Roku users will be able to sign up for HBO Max using Roku&#8217;s built-in payment system, Roku Pay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This news comes about a month after HBO Max filled a similar gap by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/hbo-max-arrives-on-amazon-fire-tv-devices/">finally launching on Amazon Fire devices</a>, and days after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/warner-bros-hbo-max-simultaneous-release/">announcement of a mega deal</a> that will see all 2021 Warner Bros. films launch on HBO Max on the same day they hit theaters.</p>
<p>With this launch, HBO Max will have most of the key bases covered, with support on iOS, Android, Chromecast, Roku, Amazon&#8217;s Fire devices, PC/Mac and all of the modern gaming consoles minus the Switch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[An IPO? A shoe-reselling marketplace? Sure! At the numbers we know about it, why not?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, TechCrunch reported that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/stockx-raises-275m-series-e-valuing-the-retailer-at-2-8b/">consumer reseller marketplace StockX</a> raised $275 million at a valuation of approximately $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>Selling a tenth of your company for north of a quarter-billion may be somewhat common among late-stage software startups with tremendous growth, but one known for its market share in the sneaker resale niche? Don&#8217;t laugh, the round actually makes pretty OK sense. And given the growth that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stockx" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stockx">StockX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has managed, it could have a path to the public markets in under a year.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Don&#8217;t laugh, the round actually makes pretty OK sense.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In our piece covering the funding round, <a href="https://twitter.com/mjburnsy?lang=en">Matt Burns</a> wrote that StockX saw its nondomestic sales rise 260% in Q3 compared to the year-ago period, recording half of its 13 million transactions in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t really enough to get my head around the round, so I went hunting. Here&#8217;s a grip of other, dated growth metrics that help us put the new funding into proper context:</p>
<ul>
<li> In mid-2019, when StockX became a unicorn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/technology/trading-sneakers-stockx.html">after raising $110 million</a>, it reported $100 million or more in monthly gross merchandise volume. It had around 800 employees at the time.</li>
<li>As part of that deal, a former eBay exec and former NYSE executive vice president of the New York Stock Exchange took over as CEO and took a board seat. The man in question, Scott Cutler, remains the company&#8217;s chief executive.</li>
<li>StockX claimed more than $1 billion in gross merchandise volume <a href="https://stockx.com/news/year-in-review-2019/">in 2019</a> (the company supports streetwear and luxury resales as well as sneakers). The company closed out 2019 with around 1,000 employees.</li>
<li>In mid-2020, StockX released <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stockx-releases-mid-year-marketplace-momentum-report-pointing-to-accelerated-growth-amidst-pandemic-surpasses-2-5-billion-in-gross-merchandise-value-301092276.html">a midyear report</a> &#8212; née &#8220;corporate brag sheet&#8221; &#8212; saying that it had surpassed $2.5 billion in gross merchandise volume, and 10 million trades, half of which had been recorded in the last year.</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand if those numbers are impressive or not, we&#8217;ll need to convert gross merchandise result into revenue. So, we&#8217;ll need to better understand StockX&#8217;s fee structure.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
