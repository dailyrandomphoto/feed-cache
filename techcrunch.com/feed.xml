					<description><![CDATA[Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>This past week, I wrote about the launch of Fractional, a startup that wants to make it easier for friends (and strangers) to co-own real estate together. The co-founders, Stella Han and Carlos Treviño, bonded over their shared background of growing up in real estate families while working at Affirm, the buy now, pay later giant. However, the mission of “pay at your own pace” at Affirm clashed with the duo’s firsthand experience of the taxing time commitment and high costs that come with owning real estate; a contrast that eventually seeded the idea for Fractional.</p>
<p>I get more into the specifics of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/fractional-lands-5-5-million-to-let-friends-and-strangers-invest-in-real-estate-together/">Fractional’s product and its recent fundraise in my story,</a> but today I want to focus on a bit of my interview with Han, the co-founder, that has stuck with me. During our phone call, we chatted about how the future of alternative investing is built on on-ramping folks into a long-exclusionary asset class; we’re seeing it with private equity, art ownership and, now, real estate. While lowering the check size for entry matters — it’s one of Fractional&#8217;s hooks — so does the social aspect. Can you meaningfully educate a cohort of people to understand the value that they’re going to get from putting money into a home versus an index fund? Can you &#8220;disrupt&#8221; hesitation to get into business with friends? Can you plan for the unplanned twists and turns of life and someone in your investment group wanting liquidation sooner rather than later? These questions are all far more interesting, and thorny, than the logistical argument of making home ownership accessible. Fractional, I hope, will make it collaborative as well.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239019" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The way that Fractional has been preparing for the unexpected, so far, looks like some classic curation. Han explained that they’re building investment communities around specific properties, with the goal of putting together like-minded folks. “It doesn&#8217;t make sense for someone who&#8217;s thinking about flipping a property in a year versus someone who wants to hold for like five years,” she said. By eliminating major core differences upfront, and then getting lawyers involved, the startup is beginning to pacify early concerns. Still, the startup’s heaviest lift — like any business promising to bring access to a new asset — will be governance and transparently establishing expectations.</p>
<p>Fractions aren’t enough of an answer when trying to resolve divisions, and that’s a lesson for both startups and the pumpkin pie lovers among us. In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll tease some gift guides, and, um, estate management.

<p>TechCrunch is beginning to roll out our annual gift guides! For those who are new, we have a tradition of publishing niche-yet-nerdy wish lists every year to help gift-givers make decisions. It can range from gadgets to upgrade your work-from-home setup, or gifts to make you less lonely.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>So far, we’ve published gift guides for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/work-from-home-office-gift-ideas/">work-from-home office</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/webcams-and-microphones-for-better-video-calls/">video call setup</a> and the cohort of homeowners who want to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/smart-home-gift-guide-ideas/"> upgrade their home into a smart home</a>. Oh, and we also published a wishlist for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/gift-guide-the-best-tech-gifts-for-plant-geeks/">plant lovers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/stem-toys-for-kids-and-teens/">for kids who love STEM toys</a>. Can you tell that we’ve all been inside for way too long?</p>
<p>Speaking of hardware:</p>

<p>New Culture! Anyone who listens to the podcast knows that I absolutely love a cheesy startup, both figuratively and literally. This week, New Culture raised $25 million in seed funding to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/new-culture-lands-25-million-in-seed-funding-to-commercialize-its-cheesy-vegan-mozzarella/">commercialize its cheesy vegan mozzarella</a>. Maybe it’ll get to grocery stores soon enough!</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> The alternative cheese manufacturer claims that it’s far better for the environment than dairy-based cheese, which can require 56 gallons of water just to produce one ounce. New Culture also touted progress when it comes to land use.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about estate planning (partially because the topic is core to the latest season of &#8220;Insecure,&#8221; and partially because it feels like one of those parts of life no one, understandably, wants to plan for). In a column for TechCrunch+, Gentreo CEO and founder Renee Fry gave founders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/estate-planning-basics-for-founders-and-entrepreneurs/">some basic estate planning tips</a>, both for high-net-worth individuals and simple startup owners.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Fry argues that estate plans should constantly be adjusted throughout a person’s life, especially if they’re in charge of a thriving business. The fluidity of a business’ success is exciting in real time but could bring challenges when it comes to succession planning.</p>
<blockquote><p>You must decide whom you trust to take over your company if something happens to you. It is not just about having an estate plan that expresses your wishes — it’s almost equally important to communicate it with a written succession plan. — Renee Fry</p></blockquote>
<p>And, there’s always <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/26/original-content-succession-review/">a succession angle</a>:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/italy-amazon-apple-reseller-collusion/">Italy fines Amazon and Apple $230M over alleged reseller collusion</a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238758" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p>Twitter’s e-commerce initiatives now include livestream shopping, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/walmart-will-be-the-first-retailer-to-test-twitters-new-livestream-shopping-platform/">announced this week,</a> and Walmart will be the first retailer to test the new platform. The Live Shopping service will take advantage of Twitter&#8217;s existing capabilities in livestreaming content and its newer e-commerce features, like the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/twitter-shopping--testing-shoppable-profiles-on-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop Module</a> for business profiles. During the upcoming livestream event, users will be able to watch the show, tweet to join the conversation from the Live Events page, and browse products on the &#8220;Shop&#8221; and &#8220;Latest&#8221; tabs just below the video. When ready to purchase, users will click through to the retailer&#8217;s website where the livestream will continue &#8212; so they don&#8217;t have to miss any of the show.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Walmart was a sensible first partner for the new effort, as the retailer has been increasingly investing in livestream events across social media. Over the past year, it hosted more than 15 livestream events across five platforms, including YouTube, TikTok and its own website, among others.</p>
<p>Its Twitter livestream will focus on Cyber Deals and will kick off on November 28 at 7 PM ET in the U.S. The stream will also be broadcast on Walmart.com/live, and across the retailer’s Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube accounts.</p>
<p>Twitter says this is the first-ever e-commerce livestream on its platform, but it plans to bring more experiences like this to its customers in the future.</p>
<p>The event will also serve as a means of testing the Twitter user base&#8217;s appetite for live shopping, which today often takes place on other social apps, like Instagram and Facebook, on dedicated live commerce platforms and on video services like YouTube and TikTok. But Twitter &#8212;  a place where users tend to track news, events, pop culture trends, politics and more &#8212; hasn&#8217;t yet defined itself as a platform. Its overabundance of new features released in the past year feel more like spaghetti being thrown at the wall to see what sticks, instead of a carefully planned roadmap. Twitter today wants to be a home to live audio, creator subscriptions, newsletters, bitcoin tipping, NFTs, private communities and more. But, in reality, only some of these things will actually work. For example, Twitter already had to kill its Stories feature (Fleets) due to lack of traction. And its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">early days of Super Follow, subscriptions</a> didn&#8217;t produce much revenue.</p>
<p>Whether or not it will be able to offer the sort of live commerce experience that resonates with consumers and delivers retailers&#8217; objectives still remains to be seen.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Snapchat is bringing AR to holiday shopping.</strong> On Black Friday (11/26), the company will launch the Snap Holiday Market, which will feature immersive AR experiences from a half-dozen brand partners, including Amazon Prime Video, Coca-Cola, Hollister, Under Armour, Verizon and Walmart. Each brand will have a dedicated storefront where Snapchat users can browse their products and deal in an AR space designed for each brand. The market will be available from the Lens Carousel and the top of the &#8220;For You&#8221; tab in the Lens Explorer.</li>
<li><strong>Snap also plans to offer AR try-on and e-commerce Lenses throughout the holiday shopping season,</strong> including those from brands like American Eagle, Fendi, Diork Kaja Beauty, NYX Cosmetics, Shein and Tory Burch.</li>
<li><strong>The company announced a new AR stat, as well: Snapchat now sees over 6 billion AR Lens plays</strong> <strong>every day</strong> on average, it said.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Fintech</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The German neobank N26 <a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/german-challenger-bank-n26-to-shutter-us-operations/610285/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will shutter its U.S. operations</a></strong>. The company&#8217;s 500,000 U.S. customers will see their accounts closed on January 11 and will be provided with instructions on how to withdraw their funds. The company said it made the decision to better focus on its core European business and plans to launch to more countries in Eastern Europe, as well as Brazil. The bank had previously shut down its business in the U.K., citing post-Brexit difficulties.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Social</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>TikTok hires a new head of diversity and inclusion.</strong> The company <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/11/22/tiktok-names-shavone-charles-head-of-diversity-inclusion-communications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has hired</a> Shavone Charles, previously of VSCO, Instagram and Twitter, to fill the newly created role. The exec will be LA-based and report to TikTok&#8217;s head of comms, Hilary McQuaide.</li>
<li><strong>Kuaishou, the Chinese maker of the largest short-form video platform after TikTok, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-23/kuaishou-defies-china-crackdown-as-revenue-climbs-33?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported earnings</a>.</strong> Revenue rose 33% as the company reported 20.5 billion yuan ($3.2 billion) for the three months ended September, versus the 20.1 billion yuan average forecast. Total MAUs on its main app reached 573 million, though the company had to shut down its U.S. TikTok rival Zynn earlier this year.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/birdwatch/status/1462834006618214400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made a change</a> to its crowdsourced fact-checking program, Birdwatch,</strong> which now allows users to submit their contributions anonymously. Twitter says pilot users &#8220;overwhelmingly&#8221; requested this feature, particularly women and Black contributors. &#8220;Research has shown that aliases have the potential to reduce bias, by putting focus on the content of a note, not the author,&#8221; Twitter said, adding that aliases may also &#8220;reduce polarization by helping people feel comfortable crossing partisan lines.&#8221;</li>

<li><strong>Twitter also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/twitter-ios-update-prevents-tweets-from-disappearing-while-youre-reading-them/">updated</a> its iOS app to address the annoying bug (which Twitter must have thought was a feature) where your timeline would refresh automatically, making the tweets you were actively reading disappear</strong> from view. After first fixing this issue on the web, Twitter is now rolling it out to iOS users.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit said it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/reddit-is-shutting-down-dubsmash-and-integrating-video-tools-into-its-own-app/">shutting down Dubsmash</a>, the short-form video app it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22796234/reddit-dubsmash-video-creation-tools?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> late last year, and is integrating video tools into its own app.</strong>  Reddit said its camera features will now include the ability to change recording speeds and the option to set a timer, similar to other short-form video apps. Users can now also upload videos in landscape, portrait mode and fill, as well as adjust and trim multiple clips. The company is also adding a new editing screen that includes text Stickers, a drawing tool and filters. And users have the option to add voiceovers or adjust the volume directly on the editing screen.</li>
<li><strong>Social networking app for women <a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peanut</a> announced a new feature called &#8220;Go Global,&#8221; which will allow its users to connect with other women around the world, instead of only those nearby.</strong> The company said there was demand for the option after it launched its live audio feature Pods. But it could also make Peanut more useful in markets where there just aren&#8217;t that many local users to connect with.</li>

<li><strong>The TikTok app ecosystem is huge. Correction!</strong> In our last newsletter, we pointed to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-app-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensor Tower&#8217;s analysis of the TikTok app ecosystem</a> and mistakenly referred to its &#8220;400 or so mobile apps.&#8221; The ecosystem saw 400 apps <em>debut in 2020</em>, but in total, there are some 900 apps tied to TikTok to offer things like downloading videos, viewing analytics, tracking hashtags and more. Meanwhile, those 900 apps reached over 1 billion downloads worldwide, not 3 billion. (But TikTok, including its sister app Douyin, have 3.3 billion installs, for comparison.)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Messaging</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook, err Meta, said it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebook-delays-completing-e2ee-until-2023/">delaying</a> the launch of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) across its messaging products until 2023 following warnings from child safety campaigns</strong>, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Such a system would prevent law enforcement and tech platforms from being able to detect child abusers, critics warned, and asked Meta to not proceed until it had a plan in place to prevent child abuse from being undetected on its platform. A former Facebook employee also <a href="https://twitter.com/elegant_wallaby/status/1462845336288825344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused</a> Meta of announcing an absurdly accelerated timeline for E2EE to preempt antitrust action and for &#8220;good marketing,&#8221; which would have resulted in systems to identify child grooming, sextortion and CSAM distribution operating at less than 10% of the effectiveness of the systems that did inspect content.</li>
<li><strong>WhatsApp introduced a new feature that would allow its web and desktop users to make their own custom stickers for use in the messaging app.</strong> The sticker maker is available from any chat from the paperclip icon, then clicking on &#8220;Sticker.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple Podcasts <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791968/apple-podcasts-star-score-review-prompt?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gets a suspicious boost</a> in its App Store ratings.</strong> At first, it looked like angry podcast listeners and creators would finally have their say about the app&#8217;s decline by downrating Apple&#8217;s Podcasts app after Apple, for the first time, made its first-party apps reviewable by the public. But soon thereafter, the previously (embarrassingly) 1.8 star-rated app jumped, in a little over a month, to a 4.6 star rating. What gives? Apple critic Kosta Eleftheriou<a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856197393772547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1460856197393772547%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791968%2Fapple-podcasts-star-score-review-prompt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> first noticed the change</a>, and theorizes it&#8217;s because Apple is now intelligently prompting users for reviews &#8212; which, to be fair, is its right. But many of the reviews seem to be people reviewing the podcasts themselves, not the actual app, which is odd and&#8230;a bit suspicious.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify <a href="https://www.imore.com/spotify-dropping-its-auto-shuffle-feature-and-replacing-it-play-button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will drop</a> its shuffle feature on albums, after Adele asked.</strong> The streamer would previously default to shuffle mode but Adele had asked Spotify to allow her new album to play in the intended order. The artist <a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify/status/1462273326722605060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1462273326722605060%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imore.com%2Fspotify-dropping-its-auto-shuffle-feature-and-replacing-it-play-button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that &#8220;our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended,&#8221; when thanking Spotify for the adjustment.</li>
<li><strong>Music streaming app Tidal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/tidal-is-investing-direct-artist-payments-a-step-toward-fair-streaming-payouts/">introduced</a> direct artist payments,</strong> which aims to more equitably distribute funds to artists, compared with the models used by Apple and Spotify. With this user-centric payment system, subscription fees are directly distributed to the artists a user streams.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok expands its TV footprint.</strong> The short-form video app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/tiktok-brings-its-tv-app-to-more-devices-across-the-u-s-and-canada/">rolled out to more TV devices</a> across the U.S. and Canada with the addition of support for Google TV and Android TV OS, as well as LG and Samsung Smart TVs. Amazon Fire TV was previously supported.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify tests a TikTok-like feed.</strong> The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/spotify-tests-a-tiktok-like-vertical-video-feed-in-its-app/">is the latest to experiment with short-form video</a> in its app as a means of content discovery. Except in Spotify&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s capitalizing on its existing Canvas video format but presenting it in a new place.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/spotify-debuts-a-netflix-hub-featuring-music-and-podcasts-tied-to-netflix-shows-and-movies/">debuted</a> a &#8220;Netflix Hub&#8221; on its app, which features playlists, soundtracks and podcasts tied to Netlflix shows and movies.</strong> The companies had partnered on other initiatives before now, and see the hub as a way to serve their respective audiences with new and, sometimes exclusive, entertainment content.</li>

<h3><strong>Gaming</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Netflix&#8217;s new gaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-two-more-titles-including-the-return-of-gamelofts-asphalt-xtreme/">added two more titles</a>, including the return of Gameloft&#8217;s &#8220;Asphalt Xtreme.&#8221;</strong> The streamer recently expanded its service worldwide across iOS and Android, with a handful of titles, including a few casual games and two &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221;-themed games. Now, it&#8217;s added another arcade title, &#8220;Bowling Ballers,&#8221; and a reboot of Gameloft&#8217;s action racing game, &#8220;Asphalt Xtreme,&#8221; which had officially shut down just in September.</li>

<li><strong>Telsa&#8217;s app <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/teslas-app-outage-exposes-the-bigger-problem-of-iot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced</a> an outage that prevented car owners from opening their doors or starting their vehicles.</strong> Users reported getting a 500 server error on their iOS app, leading them to tweet at Elon Musk directly for help.</li>

<p>Of course, the metaverse has bitcoin? I mean, for sheer rubbernecking purposes we have to check out Niantic&#8217;s latest app. The Pokémon GO maker has weirdly teamed up with a bitcoin rewards and payments app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fold-bitcoin-cashback-rewards/id1480424785#?platform=iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fold</a>, to launch an AR bitcoin mining experience called <a href="https://foldapp.com/features/bitcoin-augmented-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fold AR</a>. Currently in beta, Fold AR lets users earn bitcoin and other in-app benefits by exploring their physical surroundings using augmented reality. Unlike in Pokémon GO, where users seek out rare creatures, Fold users will collect bitcoin and other prizes, including those that increase their bitcoin cashback rewards. The company believes the game will appeal to bitcoin newcomers and existing cryptocurrency fans alike and will drive users to Fold&#8217;s app &#8212; where the in-app AR experience lives. Before the AR launch, Fold was focused on its bitcoin cashback experience where users connect their credit card, their Fold card or a bitcoin wallet, in order to purchase gift cards and receive cash back in the form of BTC. Fold AR rolls out on November 23 to select users and will add more users over time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Hello from the blisteringly cold East Coast of the United States, where I am <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1463516913594777606">eating doughnuts</a> to ward off the effects of my COVID-19 vaccine booster shot. Thus far the third dose of Moderna is not as bad as the second, but who knows what is coming. So we’ll stay brief today in case I fall out of my desk chair and straight into a nap midkeystroke.</p>
<p>To start, thank you. This little weekend newsletter now has comfortably over 30,000 subscribers, and an open rate that sits in the mid- to high-40s each week. It’s part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">larger project</a> I kicked off at TechCrunch when I came back but was far from a settled question when we added the newsletter to the regular Exchange columns.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239381" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Frankly, I figured it was a coin flip if it would get an audience. The bet wound up paying out, and because of you, The Exchange now publishes six times weekly. That’s just good fun. Thank you.</p>
<p>Now, risk!</p>
<p>A little while back we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/as-valuations-soar-and-ipos-accelerate-the-public-is-taking-on-more-startup-risk/">chatted through the point</a> that risks from the startup market are slipping more frequently into the public markets. This meant that the regular investor can now get their hands on more nascent, higher-priced startup equity than before thanks to SPACs and some, well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/"><em>interesting</em> public offerings</a>.</p>
<p>But inside that point was the implicit argument that <em>startup</em> risk is also rising for its <em>private</em> market backers. Let’s talk about what is going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup valuations are rising thanks to ample capital availability, limited investments with strong yield and related issues. You’ve heard this bit before.</li>
<li>Startup valuations are <em>also</em> rising thanks to more investors going earlier in the investing process. Again, you’ve heard this before. But you may not be aware of how it’s a self-reinforcing issue. Large funds can invest a stage “earlier” than they might given the size of their funds, essentially taking out an option contract on a larger purchase of shares in the startup in question without risking their overall returns profile. This pushes later-stage money, generally, earlier. And valuations rise as later-stage investors are less price-sensitive to early-stage valuations thanks to a dollar differential. More simply, if you have $1 billion to invest and you put $5 million into a Series A, you don’t care that much if it’s at a $65 million pre-money valuation or a $75 million pre-money valuation. What you <em>do</em> care about is putting $50 million more into winners when they raise their next round.</li>
<li>But there’s more: Venture investors report to The Exchange that startup valuations are rising in part thanks to growth rates not only proving stronger than anticipated at tech companies, but also that growth rates are proving to be more <em>durable</em> than expected. That’s to say that former startups are going public with faster growth than many expected, and they are holding onto that pace of expansion longer. The impact of that is that tech companies may be worth more in the future than anticipated, so investors can pay more now and not worry as much incrementally as you’d expect.</li>
<li>Another factor to consider regarding rising prices that Menlo investor <a href="https://twitter.com/mmurph">Matt Murphy</a> explained to me recently is that the old venture expectations of startup failure rates are now incorrect. The failure rate is lower than it was, and the all-important <em>hit</em> rate is higher, he said.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might look at the above as a whole, and think <em>well, maybe all those insta-unicorns and six-figure rounds make sense?</em> It’s a somewhat comforting perspective to take. After all, the putatively smart money is taking the wager that faster, more durable growth and fewer failures — essentially that SaaS is hard to kill — will balance out higher costs to generate the sort of returns required to make venture math square up.</p>
<p>But, <em>butttttttttt</em>, there’s more and more risk being taken on because the fundamentals of the startup market have not improved much since the COVID-induced boom in software buying took off after the initial shocks of the pandemic wore off. That’s to say: The startups that venture investors are backing this year haven’t really seen their macro fortunes improve since mid-2020, but they are busy raising lots more money, lots faster. That generates increased investment risk.</p>
<p>There are more than 900 unicorns in the market today, all of which will need IPOs to generate the sort of return that their backers expect. If the market does finally correct a bit, just to get a <em>little</em> more historically aligned, quite a number of high-priced private companies could find themselves stuck in limbo between their private-market valuation and what the public markets might pay. It <em>could</em> get sticky. People are just betting that it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>All this is to say that despite there being some reasonable reasons for why startup prices are going up as they also raise more capital, earlier and faster, it is hardly a zero-marginal-risk wager.</p>
<p>Now, go eat some leftovers and get the fuck offline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Riding a scooter in Paris will soon feel incredibly… slow. The City of Paris has <a href="https://www.paris.fr/pages/mobilites-paris-accelere-pour-mieux-reguler-l-espace-public-19830">announced</a> that scooter sharing services should restrict the maximum top speed to 10km/h (that&#8217;s 6.2mph). That decision comes following a number of pedestrian injuries that involved a scooter.</p>
<p>Paris has been an important market for scooter sharing companies. It’s a dense city with an important network of bike lanes. There are also a lot of tourists looking for different ways to explore the city.</p>
<p>For those reasons, the situation used to be a bit out of control. At some point, 16 different scooter startups wanted to operate a fleet of scooters in Paris. Paris ended up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/lime-dott-and-tier-win-paris-scooter-permits-delivering-bird-a-loss-in-a-key-market/">selecting three companies</a> and implementing a set of rules. Dott, Lime and Tier won permits to operate shared electric scooters for two years.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239852" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Since then, things have been going well for those three companies. This year alone, Dott <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-e-scooter-and-micromobility-startup-dott-raises-85-million/">raised</a> $85 million in a mix of equity and asset-backed debt financing, Tier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/e-scooter-startup-tier-raises-250-million-round-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/">recently raised</a> $200 million in debt and equity, and Lime <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/lime-raises-523-million-as-it-prepares-to-go-public/">closed a $523 million raise</a> in convertible debt and term loan financing. Except that scooters became a public safety issues for riders, but also for people just walking down the street. According to <a href="https://www.lematin.ch/story/les-trottinettes-seront-limitees-a-10-km-h-a-paris-669769881277">the AFP</a>, scooters have been involved in 298 accidents in 2021 alone. 329 people have been injured and two persons died.</p>
<p>In particular, a <a href="https://www.lci.fr/justice-faits-divers/italienne-tuee-par-une-trottinette-a-paris-la-conductrice-mise-en-examen-2189668.html">dramatic event</a> occurred back in June 2021. Two women were riding a scooter near the Seine at night. They hit a pedestrian and left her there. A couple of days later, she passed away at the hospital.</p>
<p>The relationship between the City of Paris and scooter startups never really went back to normal following the accident. On July 1st, Paris listed <a href="https://mairiepariscentre.paris.fr/pages/trottinettes-en-libre-service-paris-centre-pionnier-sur-la-regulation-des-vitesses-18148">a dozen areas</a> with a high density of pedestrians, such as the Tuileries and Palais Royal gardens or the Bastille and République squares. Scooter sharing companies agreed to limit the maximum speed to 10km/h in these areas using real-time geolocation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.frandroid.com/produits-android/mobilite-urbaine/trottinette-electrique/1051647_trottinettes-electriques-en-libre-service-leur-bridage-a-10-km-h-pourrait-prendre-de-lampleur">September</a>, the City of Paris asked each <i>arrondissement</i> administration to list areas where the top speed of scooters should be limited to 10km/h. The result was a <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/entry/a-paris-la-vitesse-des-trottinettes-electriques-limitee-a-10kmh-dans-pres-de-700-zones_fr_6192021be4b06c5987c9b664">patchwork of 700 slow zones</a>. And scooter startups agreed to implement those zones in their respective service.</p>

<p>But the City of Paris wants to go even further than that. The entire city is now a slow zone for scooter startups, except a couple of streets that have wide lanes for bikes, scooters and other micromobility vehicles. Of couse, if you have your own scooter, those restrictions won&#8217;t apply to your personal device. The new restrictions on scooter sharing services will be implemented during the first half of December.</p>
<p>The only good news is that the scooter tender has been extended by six months. Dott, Lime and Tier will keep their scooter permits until February 2023. But today&#8217;s new rules could have some significant consequences on usage in Paris.</p>
<h2>Regulating mopeds</h2>
<p>In other news, the City of Paris is also going to regulate free-floating electric mopeds. There are currently five companies operating in Paris — Cityscoot, Cooltra, Lime, Yego and Troopy. Other companies are also working on a launch in Paris.</p>
<p>Paris wants to regulate mopeds with permits. It’ll work a bit like scooter permits, except that those permits will last five years. Only two or three companies will be able to operate a fleet of mopeds in Paris. The new system will start on September 1st, 2022.</p>

With both processors in place, the headset won&#8217;t need to be tethered to an iPhone or a Mac.</p>
<p>The device will be able to provide not just augmented, but also virtual reality experiences, Kuo said, thanks to a pair of 4K Micro OLED displays from Sony. That&#8217;ll only be possible, because the M1 chip has the power needed to be able to support the displays. As for the separate processor for its sensor, it&#8217;s apparently necessary because &#8220;the computing power of the sensor is significantly higher than that of the iPhone.&#8221; Kuo expects the device to arrive in late 2022 and said Apple will make sure it can support a &#8220;comprehensive range of applications&#8221; with the ultimate goal of replacing the iPhone in a decade&#8217;s time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple and Google have been fined €10 million apiece by <a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/PS11147-PS11150">Italy&#8217;s competition and market authority</a> (AGCM) which has found they did not provide their users with clear enough information on commercial uses of their data &#8212; in violation of the country&#8217;s consumer code.</p>
<p>The regulator also accuses the pair of deploying &#8220;aggressive&#8221; practices to push users to accept the commercial processing.</p>
<p>Apple and Google were both contacted for a response to the ACGM&#8217;s sanction. Both said they will appeal.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239836" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Google is accused of omitting relevant information at the account creation phase and as consumers are using its services &#8212; information the regulator says should be providing in order for people to decide whether or not to consent to its use of their data for commercial ends.</p>
<p>The AGCM has also accused Apple of failing to immediately provide users with clear information on how it uses their information commercially when they create an Apple ID or access its digital stores, such as the App Store.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the rather more surprising sanction &#8212; given Apple&#8217;s carefully cultivated image as a champion of consumer privacy (not to mention the premium its devices and services tend to command vs cheaper, ad-supported alternatives, such as stuff made by Google).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook fined again in Italy for misleading users over what it does with their data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-fined-again-in-italy-for-misleading-users-over-what-it-does-with-their-data/embed/#?secret=qlx6cIDXQL" data-secret="qlx6cIDXQL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Italian regulator lumps both companies&#8217; practices together in a <a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/PS11147-PS11150">press release</a> announcing the sanctions &#8212; accusing each one of being especially aggressive in pushing self-serving commercial terms on their respective users, especially at the account creation phase.</p>
<p>For Google, the ACGM notes that it pre-sets user acceptance of commercial processing &#8212; and also notes that the adtech giant fails to provide a clear way for users to revoke consent for these data transfers later or otherwise change their choice after the account step has been completed.</p>
<p>It also takes the view that Apple&#8217;s approach denies users the ability to properly exercise choice over its commercial use of their data, with the regulator arguing the iPhone maker&#8217;s data acquisition practices and architecture essentially &#8220;condition&#8221; the consumer to accept its commercial terms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an awkward accusation for a company that splashes major marketing cash on suggesting its devices and software are superior to alternatives (such as tech made by Google) exactly because it claims to put user privacy at the core of what it does.</p>
<p>In a statement, Apple rejected the ACGM&#8217;s finding &#8212; writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We believe the Authority’s view is wrong and will be appealing the decision. <span class="il">Apple</span> has a long-standing commitment to the privacy of our users and we work incredibly hard to design products and features that protect customer data. We provide industry-leading transparency and control to all users so they can choose what information to share or not, and how it is used.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A Google spokeswoman also disagreed with the findings, sending this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have transparent and fair practices in order to provide our users with helpful tools and clear information about their usage. We give people simple controls to manage their information and limit the use of personal data, and we work hard to be fully compliant with the consumer protection rules. We disagree with the Authority&#8217;s decision and we will appeal.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Italian regulator has had a busy few days slapping big tech: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/italy-amazon-apple-reseller-collusion/">Earlier this week</a> it issued a $230M fine (total) for Apple and Amazon over alleged collusion around the sale of Apple kit on Amazon&#8217;s Italian marketplace.</p>
<p>It has also been stepping up investigations of tech giants over a period of years &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-fined-again-in-italy-for-misleading-users-over-what-it-does-with-their-data/">earlier this year</a> it fined Facebook over similar issues with its commercial use of people&#8217;s data, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/google-hit-with-123m-antitrust-fine-in-italy-over-android-auto/">this summer</a> it hit Google with a $123M fine related to Android Auto. It also has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/googles-display-advertising-business-is-under-antitrust-probe-in-italy/">open probe into Google&#8217;s displaying advertising business</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you celebrated the American Thanksgiving yesterday, you’re probably stuffed to the gills and barely able to move. Good news, though. It takes only a few clicks — no cardio required — to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">score a $20 pass</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> before our Black Friday sale ends <strong>Sunday,</strong> <strong>November 28 at 11:59 pm (PT). </strong>Maximum savings for minimal effort — keep $95 in your pocket.</p>
<p>Join the global community of space visionaries — founders, makers, scientists, investors and policy wonks — for two days devoted to funding, building and sustaining the new space economy driven by both public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the presentations on tap:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>Backing the Brightest</strong> — There’s an art to later stage space company funding, especially as the exit picture for the sector is still only just starting to take shape. We’ll talk to BVP’s Tess Hatch, Sequoia’s Shaun Maguire and Hemisphere’s Lisa Rich too learn how they evaluate which companies look primed for growth.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing NASA to the Moon and Back</strong> — Kathy Leuders is the head of the new Space Operations Mission Directorate, responsible for activities in orbit and soon, well beyond that. How will she and NASA meet the unprecedented challenge of establishing a lasting human presence on the Moon?</p>
<p><strong>From Building the Space Economy to Visiting</strong> — DCVC Partner, Chris Boshuizen has not only backed a number of leading space companies, including Rocket Lab, he also founded one of the pioneers in Planet Labs. But he also has the rare distinction of being able to say he’s personally traveled to space thanks to Blue Origin, and we’ll hear from him about that experience.</p>
<p><strong>Space Tourism Takes Off</strong> — Blue Origin’s 2021 included its first trips to space for paying passengers — including company founder Jeff Bezos and TV starship captain William Shatner. Ariane Cornell, the company’s director of astronaut and orbital Sales, will tell us what it’s like to retail those rides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Happy Friday! The TechCrunch crew is still in a modest period of repose thanks to the Thanksgiving holiday, but we wanted you to have numbers to chew on all the same. So, this morning, we&#8217;re taking a brief look at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001642896/000119312521334578/d261594ds1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsara&#8217;s IPO filing</a>.</p>

<p>You may have heard of Samsara. Founded in 2015, it&#8217;s raised more than $900 million during its life as a private company, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/samsara-2/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per Crunchbase data</a>, including a <a href="https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/FRANKLIN-RESOURCES-INC-11807/news/Samsara-Networks-Inc-announced-that-it-has-received-700-million-in-funding-from-a-group-of-investo-33866129/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simply massive $700 million round</a> in 2020 that valued Samsara at $5.4 billion.</p>
<p>Big bucks for a young company, yes, but does it have the results to back them up?</p>

But first, we have to talk about what Samsara actually does. And for that, we have to start with a phrase that you haven&#8217;t read as much about lately: IoT.</p>
<h2>What does Samsara do?</h2>
<p>If you are new to a company, reading its IPO filing is always good fun. You get to play a very diverting game &#8212; <em>Can the Company Actually Explain What It Does? </em>Most companies cannot.</p>
<p>It seems, in many cases, that after seventy-eleven rounds of edits between lawyers, bankers, comms staff, PR pros and executives, how most companies talk about themselves when they go public has been reduced to a lukewarm stew of corporate gibberish.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this is not the case with Samsara. Its business is actually pretty easy to understand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://jefa.io">Jefa</a> has raised a $2 million seed round to build a fintech startup offering digital accounts with a product specifically designed for women living in Latin America and the Caribbean. The company has managed to attract 115,000 women on its waitlist and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/jefa-is-a-challenger-bank-for-women-without-a-bank-account/">participated</a> in TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield last year.</p>
<p>Investors in Jefa include The Venture Collective, DST Global, Foundation Capital, Amador Holdings, The Fund, FINCA Ventures, Rarebreed VC, Siesta Ventures, Springbank Collective, Bridge Partners, Hustle Fund, Foundation Capital, Latitud, J20 and Magma Partners. Several business angels also participated, such as Daniel Bilbao, JP Duque, Ricardo Schaefer, Jean-Paul Orillac and Allan Arguello.</p>
<p>In addition to this founding round, the startup has also signed a deal with Visa. It’s a multi-year strategic partnership agreement. Jefa will be able to take advantage of Visa’s resources and products to create its payment products and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239718" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Visa believes in empowering women,” senior director of fintech partnerships for Visa Latin America and the Caribbean Sonia Michaca said in a statement. “Financial and digital inclusion transform economies. Women, who control the lion-share of everyday household spending, should be at the core of this transformation, yet women are vastly underserved by traditional banks. We are thrilled to be partnering with Jefa, a women-led platform in Latin America and the Caribbean, and one which explicitly serves women’s financial needs in the region.”</p>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="5f62605eccf1972ba5823488" post-id="2047736"></div> </p>
<p>The team behind Jefa believes that banks have neglected women for too long. Even challenger banks have mostly been designed for male customers in the first place. It doesn’t necessarily mean that women can’t open an account with a challenger bank. But some product decisions are unfriendly to women.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/jefa-is-a-challenger-bank-for-women-without-a-bank-account/">when Jefa founder and CEO Emma Smith pitched</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt, she listed some of the reasons why most people in Latin America who don’t currently have a bank account are women. For instance, minimum balance requirements are hostile to women who statistically earn less than men.</p>
<p>When Jefa launches, the company will let you open a digital account for free from a mobile app. You don’t have to visit a bank branch. A few days later, you’ll receive a Visa debit card. There will be a built-in savings feature and a reward program.</p>
<p>The startup plans to roll out its product in Mexico first, then Colombia and Central America. Jefa isn’t the first fintech startup trying to branch out from the unified banking offering. There are several startups trying to create vertical banks, such as banks for kids (<a href="https://www.greenlight.com">Greenlight</a> or <a href="https://www.step.com">Step</a>) or banks for climate change-focused customers (<a href="https://www.aspiration.com">Aspiration</a>). And there’s now Jefa offering digital accounts for women.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When TechCrunch asks <a href="https://www.flowrite.com/">Flowrite</a> if it&#8217;s &#8216;Grammarly on steroids&#8217;, CEO and co-founder Aaro Isosaari laughs, saying that&#8217;s the comment they always get for the AI writing productivity tool they&#8217;ve been building since late summer 2020 &#8212; drawing on early access to OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3 API, and attracting a wait-list of some 30,000 email-efficiency seeking prosumers keen to get their typing fingers on its beta.</p>
<p>The quest for &#8216;Inbox zero&#8217; &#8212; via lightning speed email composition &#8212; could be rather easier with this AI-powered sidekick. At least if you&#8217;re the sort of person who fires off a bunch of fairly formulaic emails each and every day.</p>
<p>What does Flowrite do exactly? It turns a few instructions (yes you do have to type these) into a fully fledged, nice to read email. So where Grammarly helps improve a piece of (existing) writing, by suggesting tweaks to grammar/syntax/style etc., Flowrite helps you write the thing in the first place, so long as the thing is email or some other professional messaging type comms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239762" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Email is what Flowrite&#8217;s AI models have been trained on, per Isosaari. And frustration with how much time he was having to spend composing emails was the inspiration for the startup. So its focus is firmly professional comms &#8212; rather than broader use cases for AI-generated words, such as copy writing etc (which GPT-3 is also being used for).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aWpEKnHEjX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/grammarly-raises-200m-at-a-13b-valuation-to-make-you-an-even-better-writer-through-ai/">Grammarly raises $200M at a $13B valuation to make you an even better writer using AI</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Grammarly raises $200M at a $13B valuation to make you an even better writer using AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/grammarly-raises-200m-at-a-13b-valuation-to-make-you-an-even-better-writer-through-ai/embed/#?secret=aWpEKnHEjX" data-secret="aWpEKnHEjX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In my previous work I knew that this is a problem that I had &#8212; I&#8217;d spend several hours every day communicating with different stakeholders on email and other messaging platforms,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We also knew that there are a lot more people &#8212; it&#8217;s not just our problem as co-founders; there&#8217;s millions of people who could benefit from communicating more effectively and efficiently in their day to day work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Flowrite works: The user provides a set of basic (bullet pointed) instructions covering the key points of what they want to say and the AI-powered tool does the rest &#8212; generating a full email text that conveys the required info in a way that, well, flows.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Automation is thus doing the wordy leg work of filling in courteous greetings/sign-offs and figuring out appropriate phrasing to convey the sought for tone and impression.</p>
<p>Compared to email templates (an existing tech for email productivity), Isosaari says the advantage is the AI-powered tool adapts to context and &#8220;isn&#8217;t static&#8221;.</p>
<p>One obvious but important point is that the user does also of course get the chance to check over &#8212; and edit/tweak &#8212; the AI&#8217;s suggested text before hitting send so the human remains firmly the agent in the loop.</p>
<p>Isosaari gives an example use-case of a sales email where the instructions might boil down to typing something like &#8220;sounds amazing • let&#8217;s talk more in a call • next week, Monday PM&#8221; &#8212; in order to get a Flowrite-generated email that includes the essential details plus &#8220;all the greetings&#8221; and &#8220;added formalities&#8221; the extended email format requires.</p>
<p>(Sidenote: Flowrite&#8217;s initial pitch to TechCrunch was via email &#8212; but did not <em>apparently</em> involve the use of its tool. At least the email did not include a disclosure that: &#8220;<i>This email is <a href="https://www.flowrite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.flowrite.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638000703035000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YRBAXpVn10Ckn2tmpUf6U">Flowritten</a>&#8221; </i>as a later missive from Isosaari (to send the PR as requested) did. Which, perhaps, gives an indication of the sorts of email comms you might want to speed-write (with AI) and those you maybe want to dedicated more of your human brain to composing (or at least look like you wrote it all yourself).)</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve built an AI powered writing tools that helps professionals of all kinds to write and communicate faster as part of their daily workflow,&#8221; Isosaari tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We know that there&#8217;s millions of people who spend hours every day on emails and messages in a professional context &#8212; so communicating with different stakeholders, internally and externally, takes a lot of work, daily working hours. And Flowrite helps people to do that faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>The AI tool could also be a great help to people who find writing difficult for specific reasons such as dyslexia or because English is not their native language, he further suggests.</p>
<p>One obvious limitation is that Flowrite is only able to turn out emails in English. And while GPT-3 does have models for some other common languages, Isosaari suggests the quality of its &#8216;human-like&#8217; responses there &#8220;might not be as good&#8221; as they are in English &#8212; hence he says they&#8217;ll remain focused there for now.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re using GPT-3&#8217;s language model as the core AI tech &#8212; but have also, recently, begun to use their own accumulated data to &#8220;fine tune it&#8221;, with Isosaari noting: &#8220;Already we&#8217;ve built a lot of things on top of GPT-3 as opposed to building a wrapper on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s promise for the email productivity tool is also that the AI will adapt to the user&#8217;s writing style &#8212; so that faster emails won&#8217;t also mean curtly out of character emails (which could lead to fresh emails asking if you&#8217;re okay?).</p>
<p>Isosaari says the tech is not not mining your entire email history to do this &#8212; but rather only looks at the directly preceding context in an email thread (if there is one).</p>
<p>Flowrite does also currently rely on cloud processing, since it&#8217;s calling GPT-3&#8217;s tech, but he says they want to move to on-device processing, which would obviously help address any confidentiality concerns, when we ask about that.</p>
<p>For now the tool is browser-based and integrates with web email. Currently it only works for Chrome and Gmail but Isosaari confirms the team&#8217;s plan is to expand integrations &#8212; such as for messaging platforms like Slack (but still initially at least, only for the web app version).</p>
<p>While the tech tool is still in a closed beta, the startup has just announced a $4.4 million seed raise.</p>
<p>The seed is led by Project A, along with Moonfire Ventures and angel investors Ilkka Paananen (CEO &amp; Co-founder of Supercell), Sven Ahrens (director of global growth at Spotify), and Johannes Schildt (CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Kry). Existing investors Lifeline Ventures and Seedcamp also joined in the round.</p>
<p>What types of emails and professionals is Flowrite best suited for? On the content side, Isosaari says it&#8217;s &#8220;typically replies where there&#8217;s some kind of existing context that you are responding to&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s able to understand the situation really well and adapt to it in a really natural way,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;And also for outreaches &#8212; things like pitches and proposals&#8230; What it doesn&#8217;t work that well for is if you want to write something that is really, really complex &#8212; because then in order to do that you would need to have all that information in the instructions. And then obviously if you need to spend a lot of time writing the instruction that could be even close to the final email &#8212; and there&#8217;s not much value that Flowrite can provide at that point.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also obviously not going to offer great utility if you&#8217;re firing off &#8220;really, really short emails&#8221; &#8212; since if you&#8217;re just answering with a couple of words it&#8217;s likely quicker to type that yourself.</p>
<p>In terms of who&#8217;s likely to use Flowrite, Isosaari says they&#8217;ve had a broad range of early adopters seeking to tap into the beta. But he describes the main user profile as &#8220;executives, managers, entrepreneurs who communicate a lot on a daily basis&#8221; &#8212; aka, people who &#8220;need to give a good impression about themselves and communicate very thoughtfully&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the business model front, Flowrite&#8217;s initial focus is on prosumers/individual users &#8212; although Isosaari says it may look to expand out from there, perhaps first supporting teams. And he also says he could envisage some kind of SaaS offering for businesses down the line.</p>
<p>C<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">urrently, it&#8217;s not charging for the beta &#8212; but does plan to add pricing early next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Once we move out of the beta then we&#8217;ll be starting to monetize,&#8221; he adds, suggesting that a full launch out of beta (so no more waitlist) could happen by mid 2022. </span></p>
<p>The seed funding will primarily be spent on growing the team, according to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Isosaari, </span>especially on the engineering side &#8212; with the main goal at this early stage being to tool up around AI and core product.</p>
<p>Expanding features is another priority &#8212; including adding a &#8220;horizontal way&#8221; of using the tool across the browser, such as with different email clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of an ongoing antitrust investigation into Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox by the UK&#8217;s competition regulator, the adtech giant has agreed to an expanded set of commitments related to oversight of its planned migration away from tracking cookies, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-secures-improved-commitments-on-google-s-privacy-sandbox">regulator</a> announced today.</p>
<p>Google has also put out its own <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/update-our-privacy-sandbox-commitments/">blog post</a> on the revisions &#8212; which it says are intended to &#8220;underline our commitment to ensuring that the changes we make in Chrome will apply in the same way to Google’s ad tech products as to any third party, and that the Privacy Sandbox APIs will be designed, developed and implemented with regulatory oversight and input from the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority] and the ICO [Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office]&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google announced its intention to deprecate support for the third party tracking cookies that are used for targeting ads at individuals in its Chrome browser all the way back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">2019</a> &#8212; and has been working on a stack of what it claims are less intrusive alternative ad-targeting technologies (aka, the &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221;) since then.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239759" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The basic idea is to shift away from ads being targeted at individuals (which is horrible for Internet users&#8217; privacy) to targeting methods that put Internet users in interest-based buckets and serve ads to so-called &#8220;cohorts&#8221; of users (aka, FloCs) which may be less individually intrusive &#8212; however it&#8217;s important to note that Google&#8217;s proposed alternative still has plenty of critics (the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">EFF</a>, for example, has suggested it could even amplify problems like discrimination and predatory ad targeting).</p>
<p>And many privacy advocates would argue that pure-play contextual targeting poses the least risk to Internet users&#8217; rights while still offering advertisers the ability to reach relevant audiences and publishers to monetize their content.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google&#8217;s Sandbox plan has attracted the loudest blow-back from advertisers and publishers, who will be directly affected by the changes. Some of whom have raised concerns that the shift away from tracking cookies will simply increase Google&#8217;s market power &#8212; hence the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opening an antitrust investigation into the plan in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">January</a>.</p>
<p>As part of that probe, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">CMA had already secured one set of commitments from Google</a> around how it would go about the switch, including that it would agree to halt any move to deprecate cookies if the regulator was not satisfied the transition could take place in a way that respects both competition and privacy; and agreements on self-preferencing, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A market consultation on the early set of commitments drew responses from more than 40 third parties &#8212; including, TechCrunch understands, input from international regulators (some of who are also investigating Google&#8217;s Sandbox, such as the European Commission, which opened its own probe of Google&#8217;s adtech in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">June</a>) .</p>
<p>Following that, the first set of proposed commitments has been expanded and beefed up with additional requirements (see below for a summary; and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1036204/211126_FINAL_modification_notice.pdf">here</a> for fuller detail from the CMA&#8217;s &#8220;Notice of intent to accept the modified commitments&#8221;).</p>
<p>The CMA will now consult on the expanded set &#8212; with a deadline of 5pm on December 17, 2021, to take fresh feedback.</p>
<p>It will then make a call on whether the beefed up bundle bakes in enough checks-and-balances to ensure that Google carries out the move away from tracking cookies with the least impact on competition and the least harm to user privacy (although it will be the UK&#8217;s ICO that&#8217;s ultimately responsible for oversight of the latter piece).</p>
<p>If the CMA is happy with responses to the revised commitments, it would then close the investigation and move to a new phase of active oversight, as set out in the detail of what it&#8217;s proposing to agree with Google.</p>
<p>A potential timeline for this to happen is early 2022 &#8212; but nothing is confirmed as yet.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, CMA CEO Andrea Coscelli said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have always been clear that Google’s efforts to protect user’s privacy cannot come at the cost of reduced competition.</p>
<p>That’s why we have worked with the Information Commissioner’s Office, the CMA’s international counterparts and parties across this sector throughout this process to secure an outcome that works for everyone.</p>
<p>We welcome Google’s co-operation and are grateful to all the interested parties who engaged with us during the consultation.</p>
<p class="last-child">If accepted, the commitments we have obtained from Google become legally binding, promoting competition in digital markets, helping to protect the ability of online publishers to raise money through advertising and safeguarding users’ privacy.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>More market reassurance</h2>
<p>In general, the expanded commitments look intended to offer a greater level of reassurance to the market that Google will not be able to exploit loopholes in regulatory oversight of the Sandbox to undo the intended effect of addressing competition risks and privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Notably, Google has agreed to appoint a CMA approved monitoring trustee &#8212; as one of the additional measures it&#8217;s suggesting to improve the provisions around reporting and compliance.</p>
<p>It will also dial up reporting requirements, agreeing to ensure that the CMA’s role and the regulator&#8217;s ongoing process &#8212; which the CMA now suggests should continue for a period of six years &#8212; are mentioned in its &#8220;key public announcements&#8221;; and to regular (quarterly) reporting to the CMA on how it is taking account of third party views as it continues building out the tech bundle.</p>
<p>Transparency around testing is also being beefed up.</p>
<p>On that, there have been instances, in recent months, where Google staffers have not been exactly fulsome in articulating the details of feedback related to the Origin Trial of its FloCs technology to the market, for example. So it&#8217;s notable that another highlighted change requires Google to instruct its staff not to make claims to customers which contradict the commitments.</p>
<p>Another concern reflected in the revisions is the worry of market participants of Google removing functionality or information before the full Privacy Sandbox changes are implemented &#8212; hence it has offered to delay enforcement of its Privacy Budget proposal and<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> offered commitments around the introduction of measures to reduce access to IP addresses. </span></p>
<p>We understand that concerns from market participants also covered Google removing other functionality &#8212; such as the user agent string &#8212; and that strengthened commitments are intended to address those wider worries too.</p>
<p>Self-preferencing requirements have also been dialled up. And the revised commitments include clarifications on the internal limits on the data that Google can use &#8212; and monitoring those elements will be a key focus for the trustee.</p>
<p>The period of active oversight by the CMA has also been extended vs the earlier plan &#8212; to six years from the date of any decision to accept Google’s modified commitments (up from around five).</p>
<p>This means that if the CMA agrees to the commitments next year they could be in place until 2028. And by then the UK expects to have reformed competition rules wrapping tech giant &#8212; as</p>
<p>In its own blog post, Google condenses the revised commitments thus:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Monitoring and reporting.</b> We have offered to appoint an independent Monitoring Trustee who will have the access and technical expertise needed to ensure compliance.</li>
<li><b>Testing and consultation.</b> We have offered the CMA more extensive testing commitments, along with a more transparent process to take market feedback on the Privacy Sandbox proposals.</li>
<li><b>Further clarity on our use of data.</b> We are underscoring our commitment not to use Google first-party personal data to track users for targeting and measurement of ads shown on non-Google websites. Our commitments would also restrict the use of Chrome browsing history and Analytics data to do this on Google or non-Google websites.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with the earlier set of pledges, it has agreed to apply the additional commitments globally &#8212; assuming the package gets accepted by the UK regulator.</p>
<p>So the UK regulator continues playing a key role in shaping how key web infrastructure evolves.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s blog most also makes reference to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">an opinion published yesterday by the UK&#8217;s information commission</a> &#8212; which urged the adtech industry of the need to move away from current tracking and profiling methods of ad targeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also support the objectives set out yesterday in the ICO’s <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/4019050/opinion-on-data-protection-and-privacy-expectations-for-online-advertising-proposals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/4019050/opinion-on-data-protection-and-privacy-expectations-for-online-advertising-proposals.pdf&quot;}">Opinion</a> on Data protection and privacy expectations for online advertising proposals, including the importance of supporting and developing privacy-safe advertising tools that protect people’s privacy and prevent covert tracking,&#8221; Google noted.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">This summer</a> Google announced a delay to its earlier timeline for the deprecation of tracking cookies &#8212; saying support wouldn&#8217;t start being phased out in Chrome until the second half of 2023.</p>
<p>There is no suggestion from the tech giant as this point of any additional delay to that timeline &#8212; assuming it gets the regulatory greenlight to go ahead.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Germany plans to phase out coal use by 2030, eight years earlier than previously planned, as part of its latest climate pledge. That same year, the country wants 80 percent of its electricity to come from renewable sources. Per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59399702" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>BBC</ins></em></a>, Olaf Scholz, the leader of Germany’s Social Democratic Party, announced the plan on Wednesday as part of a deal that will see the former vice-chancellor govern the country at the head of a three-party coalition made up of the Greens and Free Democrats.</p>
<p>Germany’s September 28th national election saw the Greens claim 118 seats in the Bundestag, making it the party’s best-ever showing. Scholz is expected to tap Greens leader Annalena Baerbock to serve as his foreign minister. Moreover, it’s likely Greens co-leader Robert Habeck will get the vice-chancellorship and the chance to oversee the country’s energy transition.</p>
<p>Notably, the coalition didn’t set a more aggressive emissions reduction target. By 2030, the country still plans to cut emissions by 65 percent from 1990 levels. According to an estimate from nonprofit <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/germany/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>Climate Action Tracker</ins></a>, Germany needs to reduce its greenhouse gas output by at least 70 percent by the end of the decade to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius target put forward by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-15-countries-reach-deal-to-implement-paris-climate-change-agreement.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Paris Agreement</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239781" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Additionally, in making a deal with the Social Democratic Party, the Greens made a significant compromise. Per <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/germany-s-new-climate-policies-fall-short-of-greens-promises-1.1686832" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, the country will use natural gas to ease the transition between coal and renewables. Critics also say the coalition had to do more to push electric vehicle adoption. The government only plans to have 15 million EVs on German roads by 2030. “This does not look like a coalition for progress,” Christoph Bautz, the head of Campact, told <a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/reactions-climate-and-energy-plans-germanys-next-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Clean Energy Wire</ins></em></a>. “The climate movement will have to keep pushing the coalition to truly make it a climate government.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been well over two years since the UK&#8217;s data protection watchdog warned the behavioural advertising industry it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">wildly out of control</a>.</p>
<p>The ICO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">hasn&#8217;t done anything</a> to stop the systematic unlawfulness of the tracking and targeting industry abusing Internet users&#8217; personal data to try to manipulate their attention &#8212; not in terms of actually enforcing the law against offenders and stopping what digital rights campaigners have described as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">biggest data breach in history</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">sued over inaction against real-time-bidding&#8217;s misuse of personal data</a> by complainants who filed a petition on the issue all the way back in September 2018.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239714" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But today the UK&#8217;s (outgoing) information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, published an <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/4019050/opinion-on-data-protection-and-privacy-expectations-for-online-advertising-proposals.pdf">opinion</a> &#8212; in which she warns the industry that its old unlawful tricks simply won&#8217;t do in the future.</p>
<p>New methods of advertising must be compliant with a set of what she describes as &#8220;clear data protection standards&#8221; in order to safeguard people’s privacy online, she writes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8URFMDzwJw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">Privacy experts slam UK&#8217;s &#8216;disastrous&#8217; failure to tackle unlawful adtech</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Among the data protection and privacy &#8220;expectations&#8221; Denham suggests she wants to see from the next wave of online ad technologies are:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>• engineer data protection requirements by default into the design of the initiative;</p>
<p>• offer users the choice of receiving adverts without tracking, profiling or targeting based on personal data;</p>
<p>• be transparent about how and why personal data is processed across the ecosystem and who is responsible for that processing;</p>
<p>• articulate the specific purposes for processing personal data and demonstrate how this is fair, lawful and transparent;</p>
<p>• address existing privacy risks and mitigate any new privacy risks that their proposal introduces</p>
<p>Denham says the goal of the opinion is to provide &#8220;further regulatory clarity&#8221; as new ad technologies are developed, further specifying that she welcomes efforts that propose to:</p>
<p>• move away from the current methods of online tracking and profiling practices;</p>
<p>• improve transparency for individuals and organisations;</p>
<p>• reduce existing frictions in the online experience;</p>
<p>• provide individuals with meaningful control and choice over the processing of device information and personal data;</p>
<p>• ensure valid consent is obtained where required;</p>
<p>• ensure there is demonstrable accountability across the supply chain;</p>
<p>The timing of the opinion is interesting &#8212; given an impending decision by Belgium&#8217;s data protection agency on a flagship ad industry consent gathering tool. (And current UK data protection rules share the same foundation as the rest of the EU, as the country transposed the General Data Protection Regulation into national law prior to Brexit.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">Earlier this month</a> the IAB Europe warned that it expects to be found in breach of the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation, and that its so-called &#8216;transparency and consent&#8217; framework (TCF) hasn&#8217;t managed to achieve either of the things claimed on the tin.</p>

<p>But this is also just the latest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">&#8216;reform&#8217; missive from the ICO to rule-breaking adtech</a>.</p>
<p>And Denham is merely restating requirements that are derived from standards that already exist in UK law &#8212; and wouldn&#8217;t need reiterating had her office actually enforced the law against adtech breache(r)s. But this is the regulatory dance she has preferred.</p>
<p>This latest ICO salvo looks more like an attempt by the outgoing commissioner to claim credit for wider industry shifts as she prepares to leave office &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">Google&#8217;s slow-mo shift toward phasing out support for third party cookies</a> (aka, it&#8217;s &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; proposal, which is actually a response to evolving web standards such as competing browsers baking in privacy protections; rising consumer concern about online tracking and data breaches; and a big rise in attention on digital matters from lawmakers) &#8212; than it is about actually moving the needle on unlawful tracking.</p>
<p>If Denham wanted to do that she could have taken actual enforcement action long ago.</p>
<p>Instead the ICO has opted for &#8212; at best &#8212; a partial commentary on embedded adtech&#8217;s systematic compliance problem. And, essentially, to stand by as the breach continues; and wait/hope for future compliance.</p>

<p>Change may be coming regardless of regulatory inaction, however.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And, notably, Google&#8217;s &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; proposal (which claims &#8216;privacy safe&#8217; ad targeting of cohorts of users, rather than microtargeting of individual web users) gets a significant call-out in the ICO&#8217;s remarks &#8212; with Denham&#8217;s office writing in a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/ico-calls-on-google-and-other-companies-to-eliminate-existing-privacy-risks-posed-by-adtech-industry/">press release</a> that it is: &#8220;Currently, one of the most significant proposals in the online advertising space is the Google Privacy Sandbox, which aims to replace the use of third party cookies with alternative technologies that still enable targeted digital advertising.&#8221;</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The ICO has been working with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to review how Google’s plans will safeguard people’s personal data while, at the same time, supporting the CMA’s mission of ensuring competition in digital markets,&#8221; the ICO goes on, giving a nod to ongoing regulatory oversight, led by the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">has the power to prevent Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox ever being implemented</a> &#8212; and therefore to stop Google phasing out support for tracking cookies in Chrome &#8212; if the CMA decides the tech giant can&#8217;t do it in a way that meets competition and privacy criteria.</p>
<p>So this reference is also a nod to a dilution of the ICO&#8217;s own regulatory influence in a core adtech-related arena &#8212; one that&#8217;s of market-reforming scale and import.</p>
<p>The backstory here is that the UK government has been working on a competition reform that will bring in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">bespoke rules for platform giants</a> considered to have &#8216;strategic market status&#8217; (and therefore the power to damage digital competition); with a dedicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">Digital Markets Unit already established and up and running within the CMA</a> to lead the work (but which is still pending being empowered by incoming UK legislation).</p>
<p>So the question of what happens to &#8216;old school&#8217; regulatory silos (and narrowly-focused regulatory specialisms) is a key one for our data-driven digital era.</p>
<p>Increased cooperation between regulators like the ICO and the CMA may give way to oversight that&#8217;s even more converged or even merged &#8212; to ensure powerful digital technologies don&#8217;t fall between regulatory cracks &#8212; and therefore that the ball isn&#8217;t so spectacularly dropped on vital issues like ad tracking in the future.</p>
<p>Intersectional digital oversight FTW?</p>
<p>As for the ICO itself, there is a further sizeable caveat in that Denham is not only on the way out (ergo her &#8220;opinion&#8221; naturally has a short shelf life) but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">UK government is busy consulting on &#8216;reforms&#8217; to the UK&#8217;s data protection rules</a>.</p>
<p>Said reforms could see a major downgrading of domestic privacy and data protections; and even legitimize abusive ad tracking &#8212; if ministers, who seem more interested in vacuous soundbites (about removing barriers to &#8220;innovation&#8221;), end up ditching legal requirements to ask Internet users for consent to do stuff like track and profile them in the first place, per some of the proposals.</p>
<p>So the UK&#8217;s next information commissioner, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/uk-names-john-edwards-as-its-choice-for-next-data-protection-chief-as-govt-eyes-watering-down-privacy-standards/">John Edwards</a>, may have a very different set of &#8216;data rules&#8217; to apply.</p>
<p>And &#8212; if that&#8217;s the case &#8212; Denham will, in her roundabout way, have helped make sliding standards happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Polestar launched its first all-electric vehicle last year, it came in a single flavor: a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive configuration that cost around $50,000 before incentives. Next year, the automaker is adding some variety.</p>
<p>Polestar is rolling out a more affordable, single-motor, two-wheel-drive version of the sedan that still offers many of the features of the dual-motor Polestar 2 along with a few changes that make it a bit more affordable, appealing and greener for those looking to make the electric switch. In a recent drive, we put it to the test.</p>
<h2>Single or dual motor</h2>

<p>The 2022 Polestar 2 single motor offers a Polestar-estimated 270 miles of range, a bit less oomph and fewer options yet plenty of technology to make your drive easier.</p>
<p>Rather than having two motors that power all four wheels — like it does with the dual motor — this single-motor version pushes all its 231 horsepower and 243 pound-feet of torque to the front wheels. The 2022 Polestar 2 single motor comes with a 78 kWh battery pack that sits under the floor between the front and rear wheels. Polestar says that its usable capacity is 75 kWh. The same battery pack is in the Polestar 2 dual motor. Polestar can and has pushed over-the-air updates to all of its vehicles to help make charging faster and tweak battery settings to make them more efficient.</p>
<p>The 2022 Polestar 2 Single motor sedans also get the optional addition of a mechanical heat pump (available in the Plus Pack for $4,000 more) that helps maintain that charge in more adverse climates. Polestar says that under certain climate conditions the heat pump will scavenge heat from the outside air to extend the range of the vehicle by as much as 10%. Using Polestar&#8217;s estimate, that means that the 2022 Polestar 2 Single motor could gain an additional 27 miles of range thanks to the heat pump.</p>
<p>For this model year, the fully loaded Launch Edition has been eliminated. The Polestar 2 Single motor replaces it and comes with a simplified and less loaded setup including a metal roof instead of the Launch Edition&#8217;s glass one, environmentally-friendly upholstery and a choice of a handful of option &#8220;packs,&#8221; as Polestar calls them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can opt for the Plus Pack, which includes the heat pump, a glass panoramic roof, Harman Kardon premium audio and a wireless phone charger (amongst other things). This pack was on the prototype Polestar 2 I drove. You can also opt for the the Pilot Pack ($3,200 more) that includes things like adaptive cruise control and LED exterior lighting. Sadly, the vehicle I drove did not have the upgraded ADAS system so I was not able to test out what Polestar says offers Level 2 driver support aids on my drive.</p>
<h2>Native Android OS and OTA updates</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2239495" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239495" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2239495 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg" alt="2022 Polestar 2 interior google" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_2212.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2239495" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>The Polestar 2 has the distinction of being the first vehicle to use Google&#8217;s Android Automotive operating system. While Volvo has also rolled out the Android Automotive OS in some of its vehicles like the Volvo XC40 Recharge, the entire Polestar brand uses the platform.</p>
<p>Android Automotive OS is an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-it-easier-to-bring-android-apps-to-your-car/">open source operating system</a> that runs on Linux and is used as the underlying operating system in vehicle infotainment systems, including Polestar. As a result, Google services such as Google Assistant, Google Maps and the Google Play Store are embedded into the car. Android OS is not the same as Android Auto, a secondary interface that lies on top of an operating system and lets users project the functions and feel of their smartphone to the vehicle&#8217;s center display.</p>
<p>In the 2022 Polestar 2, users can choose to access almost everything in the vehicle via voice control by using the convenient &#8220;Hey Google,&#8221; initiation phrase. This phrase gets you access to climate control and driving directions. Since the public has been so deeply steeped in the Google infrastructure for so long now, it&#8217;s all highly intuitive.</p>
<p>Tell the system your feet are hot and Google OS will lower the temperature in the footwell. Want to find the best taco place in Santa Barbara? Just ask Google to search then navigate there like I did. I rarely touched the touchscreen while driving, as I could pretty much do everything I needed just by asking Google to do it for me.</p>
<p>Natural language recognition is something Google has been working on diligently for many years and it keeps getting better. A few times, when using the system, I botched a request or awkwardly asked for something like adding a stop at a local beach to take photos. The system didn&#8217;t miss a beat and untangled my language to do just what I asked it to do.</p>
<p>In the Polestar 2 Single motor I drove, charging locations were somewhat integrated to the Google Maps platform on Android OS. There are some caveats, however.</p>
<p>Ask Google to find charging stations along your route, and you can filter by brand. While doing so in Google Maps, the system won&#8217;t tell you if a charger is available or working. Polestar has partnered with ChargePoint to provide charging access, and you can use the ChargePoint App, installed on the center screen, to learn more about your selected charger. It does take some tapping around the screen before hitting the road, which means you&#8217;ll still need to pull over and stop before heading to the nearest charger. On my 200-mile roundtrip from the Pacific Design Center in Hollywood to Santa Barbara I didn&#8217;t need to stop to recharge.</p>
<p>If I had needed to recharge, Polestar says that on DC fast chargers, I could have expected to get to 80% charge in just about 30 minutes. That&#8217;s down from the 40 minutes it used to take to get to an 80% charge, according to Glenn Parker, a Polestar technical operations specialist. Parker also said that continued over-the-air updates will improve the efficiency and range of the entire portfolio as the company rolls out updates to all owners.</p>
<p>While finding an available charger is still clunky, the integration of Google Maps into the very technological fabric of the Polestar 2 means that your estimated range is displayed each time you navigate to a new place or add a stop along the way. On my day trip, I arrived at each destination with a few miles more range than the system originally thought I&#8217;d have, which was a nice surprise given that I timed my return to LA badly and sat in Westside traffic for 45 minutes, while the range hovered down around 20%.</p>
<h2>On the road</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2199792" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/car-pass-lights.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199792" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199792 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/car-pass-lights.gif" alt="Animated image of a car passing by on a curve with flashing headlights and tail lights." width="640" height="404" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2199792" class="wp-caption-text">S<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">eparate drive of 2022 Polestar 2 Dual motor.</span><strong style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Video</strong> <strong style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Credits:</strong><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Kirsten Korosec</span></p></div></p>
<p>The Polestar 2 Single motor is quiet, comfortable and quick. Polestar says that it does 0 to 60 mph in seven seconds, and while that doesn&#8217;t seem like much, it&#8217;s plenty to get you merged into traffic on the highway, especially because the low-end torque is so readily available.</p>
<p>On the prototype I drove, I could adjust a few driving features, including steering feel and one-pedal braking and could toggle some of the driver assistance systems like lane departure warning on and off. Unfortunately, as previously mentioned, my test vehicle did not have any of the advanced driver aids that Polestar offers in the Pilot pack so I didn&#8217;t get to test those.</p>
<p>One of the joys of electric vehicles is the availability of braking mode (B Mode), or one-pedal driving. Essentially you&#8217;re adjusting the level of regeneration you get from the rolling wheels when you lift off the accelerator.</p>
<p>In the Polestar 2, you can roll to a stop, or toggle on the &#8220;Creep&#8221; mode setting through the infotainment screen and the vehicle will move slowly without the accelerator pedal being necessary. I drive most electric vehicles with the most aggressive braking setting, as it&#8217;s the most efficient and most enjoyable mode to employ in Los Angeles traffic. While most people may find the highest setting in the Polestar 2 to be a bit surprising, after a few minutes of getting used to it, it becomes intuitive to use. I did however turn off the &#8220;Creep&#8221; function as it felt unnatural when paired with the regenerative braking mode.</p>
<p>I also spent 90% of my time behind the wheel using the most aggressive steering setting, called &#8220;Firm.&#8221; Essentially the system changes the steering ratio based on the setting you&#8217;ve chosen. Firm offers the most direct-feeling response, while the softer settings make the Polestar feel a bit more roly-poly and slow to respond.</p>
<h2>Right to repair, recondition, recycle</h2>
<p>Polestar makes no bones about its commitment to greener manufacturing and materials. To that end, the company is proactively considering the entire lifecycle of the batteries in its vehicles. According to Parker, the company uses blockchain to track the mining of cobalt for its batteries and is looking into using the system to track other elements used in building their vehicles.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Polestar has also thought relatively comprehensively about the battery and owner lifecycle.</p>
<p>The stacked packs in the Polestar 2 Single motor can be individually replaced as parts fail. Parker said that if one component fails, the company collects that material back to form a closed-loop system. &#8220;We&#8217;re exploring remanufacturing and reusing those components that come back,&#8221; he said. Polestar also offers complete repair instruction and access to a catalog of parts that owners can purchase directly from the company itself, too.</p>
<p>Prices for the Polestar 2 Single motor start at $45,900 and vehicles will be available starting January 2022, not including the destination fee or taxes. With the $7,500 federal tax incentive — as well as incentives from certain states — that price can come down to around $35,000 (again not including taxes and the destination fee).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been almost a year since the EU&#8217;s executive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">announced</a> it would propose rules for political ads transparency in response to concern about online microtargeting and big data techniques making mincemeat of democratic integrity and accountability.</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s come out with its proposal. But frankly it doesn&#8217;t look like the wait was worth it.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_6118">PR</a> claims the proposal will introduce &#8220;strict conditions for targeting and amplifying&#8221; political advertising using digital tools &#8212; including what it describes as a ban on targeting and amplification that use or infer &#8220;sensitive personal data, such as ethnic origin, religious beliefs or sexual orientation&#8221;.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239685" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>However the claimed &#8216;ban&#8217; does not apply if &#8220;explicit consent&#8221; is obtained from the person whose sensitive data is to be exploited to better target them with propaganda &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/cookie-consent-still-a-compliance-trash-fire-in-latest-watchdog-peek/">online &#8216;consents&#8217; to ad targeting</a> are already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">a total trashfire of non-compliance</a> in the region.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not clear why the Commission believes politically vested interests hell-bent on influencing elections are going to play by a privacy rule-book that <em>almost no online advertisers operating in the region currently do</em>, even the ones that are only trying to get people to buy useless plastic trinkets or &#8216;detox&#8217; teas.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_6212">Q&amp;A</a> offering further detail on the proposal, the Commission lists a set of requirements that it says anyone making use of political targeting and amplification will need to comply with, which includes having an internal policy on the use of such techniques; maintaining records of the targeting and use of personal data; and recording the source of said personal data &#8212; so at best it seems to be hoping to burden propagandists with the need to create and maintain a plausible paper trail.</p>
<p>Because it is also allowing a further carve-out to allow for political targeting &#8212; writing: &#8220;Targeting could also be allowed in the context of legitimate activities of foundations, associations or not-for-profit bodies with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim, when it targets their own members.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is incredibly vague. A &#8220;foundation&#8221; or an &#8220;association&#8221; with a political &#8220;aim&#8221; sounds like something any campaign group or vested interest could set up &#8212; i.e. to carry on the &#8220;legitimate&#8221; activity of (behaviorally?) targeting propaganda at voters.</p>
<p>In short, the scope for loopholes for political microtargeting &#8212; including via the dissemination of disinformation &#8212; looks massive.</p>
<p>On scope, the Commission says it wants the incoming rules to apply to &#8220;ads by, for or on behalf of a political actor&#8221; as well as &#8220;so called&#8221; issue-based ads &#8212; aka politically charged issues that can be a potent proxy to sway voters &#8212; which it notes are &#8220;liable to influence the outcome of an election or referendum, a legislative or regulatory process or voting behaviour&#8221;.</p>
<p>But how exactly the regulation will define ads that fall in and out of scope remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most substantial measure of a very thin proposal is around transparency &#8212; where the Commission has proposed &#8220;transparency labels&#8221; for paid political ads.</p>
<p>It says these must be &#8220;clearly labelled&#8221; and provide &#8220;a set of key information&#8221; &#8212; including the name of the sponsor &#8220;prominently displayed and an easily retrievable transparency notice&#8221;; along with the amount spent on the political advertisement; the sources of the funds used; and a link between the advertisement and the relevant elections or referenda.</p>
<p>However, again, the Commission appears to be hoping that a few transparency requirements will enforce a sea change on an infamously opaque and fraud-filled industry &#8212; one that has been fuelled by rampant misuse and unlawful exploitation of people&#8217;s data. Rather than cutting off the head of the hydra by <em>actually</em> curbing targeting &#8212; such as by limiting political targeting to broad-brush contextual buckets.</p>
<p>Hence it writes: &#8220;All political advertising services, from adtech that intermediate the placement of ads, to consultancies and advertising agencies producing the advertising campaigns, will have to retain the information they have access to through the provision of their service about the ad, the sponsor and the dissemination of the ad. They will have to transfer this information to the publisher of the political ad &#8212; this can be the website or app where the ad is seen by an individual, a newspaper, a TV broadcaster, a radio station, etc. The publisher will need to make the information available to the individual who sees the ad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Transparency of political advertising will help people understand when they see a paid political advertisement,&#8221; the Commission further suggests, adding: &#8220;With the proposed rules, every political advertisement – whether on Twitter, Facebook or any other online platform – will have to be clearly marked as political advertisement as well as include the identity of the sponsor and a transparency notice with the wider context of the political advertisement and its aims, or a clear indication of where it can be easily retrieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice theory but for one thing plenty of election interference originates from outside a region where the election itself is taking place.</p>
<p>On that the Commission says it will require<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> organisations that provide political advertising services in the EU but do not have a physical presence there to designate a legal representative in a Member States where the services are offered, suggesting: </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This will ensure more transparency and accountability of services providers acting from outside the Union.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>How exactly it will require (and enforce) that stipulation isn&#8217;t clear.</p>
<p>Another problem is that all these transparency obligations will only apply to &#8220;political advertising services&#8221;.</p>
<p>Propaganda that gets uploaded to online platforms like Facebook by a mere &#8220;user&#8221; &#8212; aka an entity that does not <em>self-identify</em> as a political advertising service &#8212; will apparently escape the need for any transparency accountability at all.</p>
<p>Even if they&#8217;re &#8212; y&#8217;know &#8212; working out of a Russian trollfarm that&#8217;s actively trying to destabilize the European Union&#8230; Just so long as they claim to be &#8216;Hans, 32, Berliner, loves cats, hates the CSU&#8217;.</p>
<p>Now if platforms like Facebook were perfectly great at identifying, reporting and purging inauthentic activity, fake accounts and shadey influence ops in their own backyards it <em>might</em> not be such a problem to leave the door open for &#8220;a user&#8221; to post unaccountable political propaganda. But a whole clutch of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/29/1030260/facebook-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-global-political-manipulation/">whistleblowers</a> have pointed out, in excruciating detail, that Facebook at least is very much not that.</p>
<p>So that looks like another massive loophole &#8212; one which underlines why the only genuine way to fix the problem of online disinformation and election interference is to put an end to behavioral targeting period, rather than just fiddling around the edges. Not least because by fiddly with some tepid measures that will offer only a flawed, partial transparency you risk lulling people into a false sense of security &#8212; as well as further normalizing exploitative manipulation (just so long as you have a &#8216;policy&#8217; in place).</p>
<p>Once online ads and content can be targeted at individuals based on tracking their digital activity and harvesting their personal data for profiling, it&#8217;s open season for opaque InfluenceOps and malicious interests to workaround whatever political ads transparency rules you try to layer on top of the cheap, highly scalable tools offered by advertising giants like Facebook to keep spreading their propaganda &#8212; at the expense of your free and fair elections.</p>
<p>Really what this regulation proposes is to create a large admin burden for advertisers who intend to run genuinely public/above board political campaigns &#8212; leaving the underbelly of paid mud slingers, hate spreaders and disinformation peddlers to exploit its plentiful loopholes to run mass manipulation campaigns right through it.</p>
<p>So it will be interesting to see whether the European Parliament takes steps to school the Commission by adding some choice amendments to its draft &#8212; as MEPs have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">taking a stronger line against microtargeting</a> in recent months.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/embed/#?secret=QQ7dhYOxzD" data-secret="QQ7dhYOxzD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On penalties, for now, under the Commission proposal, &#8216;official&#8217; advertising services could be fined for breaking things like the transparency and record-keeping requirements but how much will be determined locally, by Member States &#8212; at a level the Commission says should be &#8220;effective, proportionate and dissuasive&#8221;.</p>
<p>What might that mean? Well under the proposal, national Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) will be responsible for monitoring the use of personal data in political targeting and for imposing fines &#8212; so, ultimately, for determining the level of fines that domestic rule-breaking political operators might face.</p>
<p>Which does not exactly inspire a whole lot of confidence. DPAs are, after all, resourced by the same set of political entities &#8212; or whichever flavor happens to be in government.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s ICO carried out an extensive audit of political parties data processing activities following the 2018 Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal &#8212; and in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/data-audit-of-uk-political-parties-finds-laundry-list-of-failings/">2020 it reported finding a laundry list of failures</a> across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>So what did the EU&#8217;s (at the time) best resourced DPA do about all these flagrant breaches by UK political parties?</p>
<p>The ICO&#8217;s enforcement action at that point consisted of &#8212; <em>checks notes</em> &#8212; issuing a series of recommendations.</p>
<p>There was also a warning that it <em>might</em> take further action in the future. And this summer the ICO did issue one fine: Slapping the Conservative Party with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/uk-pm-boris-johnsons-tories-guilty-of-spamming-voters/">a £10,000 penalty for spamming voters</a>. Which doesn&#8217;t really sound very dissuasive tbh.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/labour-party-data-breach-ransomware/">Earlier this month</a> another of these UK political data offenders, the Labour Party, was forced to fess up to what it dubbed a &#8220;data incident&#8221; &#8212; involving an unnamed third party data processor. It remains to be seen what sanction it may face for failing to protect supporters&#8217; information in that (post-ICO-audit) instance.</p>
<p>Adtech generally has also faced very little enforcement from EU DPAs &#8212; despite scores of complaints against its privacy-eviscerating targeting methods &#8212; and despite the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">ICO saying back in 2019</a> that its methods are rampantly unlawful under existing data protection law.</p>
<p>Vested interests in Europe have been incredibly successful at stymieing regulatory enforcement against invasive ad targeting.</p>
<p>And, apparently, also derailing progress by defanging incoming EU rules &#8212; so they won&#8217;t do anything much to stop the big-data &#8216;sausage-factory&#8217; of (in this case) political microtargeting from keeping on slicing &#8216;n&#8217; dicing up the eyeballs of the citizenry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To find out why voice AI company SoundHound is set to go public via a SPAC at a nearly $2.1 billion valuation, let's have a closer look at its history, and the case for its double unicorn valuation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voice AI company SoundHound is set to go public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC transaction at a nearly $2.1 billion valuation in early 2022, blank check company Archimedes and its target <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211116005518/en/SoundHound-Inc.-Global-Leader-in-Voice-AI-Technology-to-Become-Publicly-Traded-Through-Proposed-Merger-With-Archimedes-Tech-SPAC-Partners-Co">announced</a>.</p>
<p>The last time you heard SoundHound&#8217;s name might have been several years ago when it was considered a lesser-known Shazam competitor. Now it&#8217;s worth 5.25x what Apple paid for the leading music recognition service – some $400 million, in a transaction that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/apple-closes-its-shazam-acquisition-and-says-the-music-recognition-app-will-soon-become-ad-free/">closed in the fall of 2018</a>. That was five years after TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/17/now-with-175m-users-soundhound-launches-its-ios-7-app-as-company-struggles-to-exit-shazams-shadow/">reported</a> on <a href="https://www.soundhound.com/">SoundHound</a>&#8216;s &#8220;struggles to exit Shazam&#8217;s shadow,&#8221; despite boasting more than 175 million users.</p>
<p>So what happened that would make SoundHound now significantly more valuable than its British counterpart?</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Well, some of the discrepancy might be due to Shazam&#8217;s somewhat bumpy trajectory; after all, it was valued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/sources-apple-is-acquiring-music-recognition-app-shazam/">at $1.02 million post money</a> in its 2015 fundraise. But it&#8217;s SoundHound we are looking at today, because if its <a href="https://voices.soundhound.com/pdfs/SoundHound_Investor_Presentation_11_16_2021.pdf">SPAC deck</a> is to be believed, it seems it is just doing magic in plain sight.</p>
<p>To find out more, let&#8217;s have a closer look at SoundHound&#8217;s history, and dig into the case it is making to argue for its double unicorn valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s always been a slight puzzle why <a href="http://AngelList.com">AngelList</a> never really <em>properly </em>took off in Europe, especially when, a few years ago, there was such a dearth of funding options for poorly served European startups. But the reasons are fairly simple when you look at them. For starters, the US tech industry boomed in the last ten years. Why bother spreading your resources, when your home market is taking off, right? Secondly, the sheer complexity of building such a platform across Europe’s myriad regulatory borders would tend to dissuade even the boldest of actors. So this is why the market for such a fund-raising platform has been more or less wide open for such a long time. Until now.</p>
<p><a href="https://vauban.io/">Vauban</a> is a new startup based out of London which provides venture capital fund managers with tools to raise a fund and invest capital. It’s now closed a Post-Seed / Pre-Series A funding round of £4.7m or $6.3m.</p>
<p>Vauban says it will now deepen its tech and regulatory infrastructure, and launch a new office in Luxembourg to strengthen its European / EU offering, alongside its headquarters in London. Thus it will be able to span the entire European ecosystem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239690" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The investment round was co-led by Pentech and Outward, in addition to 7percent Ventures and MJ Hudson. A roster of angel investors have also participated including CEO of Nested Matt Robinson;  the founder of Grabayo, Will Neale; the founder and CEO of ComplyAdvantage, Charles Delingpole; Partner at Augmentum Fintech Perry Blacher; and Al Giles, from legal services provider Axiom.</p>
<p>Vauban allows VCs and angel investors to raise funds, create angel syndicates, and manage fundraising and investment activities. The platform claims it enables users to set-up and deploy Funds and SPVs, from multiple global investment jurisdictions, at “a fraction of the usual time and cost”, covering structuring, legal documents, investor onboarding, banking, and reporting.</p>
<p>Vauban says it is onboarding “at least one new client every day” and current VC users include Anthemis, Passion Capital and Octopus Ventures. In total, it says over 5,000 LPs are using its platform.</p>
<p>Founder and Co-CEO Rémy Astié said: “Our goal is to reduce the friction between those who have the capital, and those who need it to solve humanity&#8217;s biggest problems. So, we decided to start by rebuilding the infrastructure on digital rails, because it&#8217;s mission-critical in order to provide a great UX to everyone in the industry: GPs, LPs and Founders.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vauban has appeared at a time when there is huge investment activity in European tech. Some €41.8bn was raised across Europe in the first half of 2021, up from €32.6bn in 2020.</p>
<p>With VC firms now managing several funds and now often using Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to participate in specific deals, make secondary investments, or set up &#8216;sidecar’ funds alongside EIS vehicles or their main institutional funds, the whole process is becoming more complex, hence the increasing ‘platformization’ of the space. Doing all this on spreadsheets or, similarly simple tools, will no longer cut it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, European angel investors are more and more professionalizing and syndicating deals to boost dealmaking and dealflow, hence why a dedicated platform is likely to be welcome.</p>
<p>Ulric Musset, Founder and Co-CEO says, &#8220;One of the biggest catalysts for new startup creation was the launch of Amazon Web Services in the early 2000s. We believe Vauban will have the same impact that AWS has had on the startup ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Andi Kazeroonian, Investor at Outward VC, commented: “Despite the meteoric growth in alternative investments in recent years, the infrastructure the industry relies on has failed to evolve. Simply creating and administering an investment vehicle remains synonymous with lengthy, cumbersome and expensive processes fragmented across multiple service providers. Vauban’s integrated platform has turned this on its head with a relentless focus on product and user experience, which has unsurprisingly led to exceptional organic growth and its emergence as the standout category leader in Europe.”</p>
<p>Craig Anderson, Partner at Pentech added: “We like to invest in category-leading companies with big ambitions for growth. We believe Vauban is building a modern infrastructure for the alternate asset market which enables users to set up, deploy and manage their funds and SPVs in just a few hours.”</p>
<p>Founder and Co-CEO Rémy Astié told me over a call: “We are different to AngelList in that we are very international and global by design. The idea is to create a global platform, which means that you can raise from LPS anywhere in the world, to invest in a company that&#8217;s anywhere in the world. And yeah, we think that&#8217;s our core strength, that we build everything with international LPs in mind, so you can raise in multiple currencies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese space startup Astroscale has raised $109 million in a new Series F round of financing, bringing the company&#8217;s total funding raised to date to $300 million. The company specializes in on-orbit servicing technology, designed to help reduce the amount of debris that exists in operating orbital altitudes, and also to extend the life of existing satellites as a means of making orbital businesses more sustainable.</p>
<p>This new funding, led by Japan&#8217;s THE FUND and including participation from investors including Seraphim Space, brings Astroscale&#8217;s total funding to $300 million. The startup&#8217;s CEO and founder Nobu Okada said in a press release that the new funds will help them scale and &#8220;dramatically accelerate [their] ability to make on-orbit servicing routine by 2030.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a big year for Astroscale (Okada will be joining us on stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL5fb8xAiw2k3zgvdb5qacvfitrBmeHyPiKqy0Z9UbQBUXt0MyqNULLcLzpjDwtf1p1b0gyhxOOtgnk0KF2bAFKh4XLjwhur7TRCL07FOJvQmEQ9nmFs41kYDrdHsYO_auHC1k6r1LyLym5ZwiSu_YfqDbbDHHLR6QEN3O5tf6ox">TC Sessions: Space 2021 this year</a>, by the way), with a successful tech demo of its end-of-life services product in August.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber will halt its ride-hailing service in most of Belgium tomorrow following a court ruling Wednesday that extends a 2015 order banning its p2p UberPop service to also cover professional drivers providing its ride-hailing service.</p>
<p>Uber told us that it is studying the detail of the ruling to decide whether to appeal the decision with the country&#8217;s Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The move also follows a temporary suspension of Uber&#8217;s service in Brussels<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uber-temporarily-suspends-brussels-service-first-europe-2021-09-30/"> in September</a> &#8212; an action the tech giant called &#8220;exceptional and unprecedented&#8221;, saying it was only taking the step to protest the lack of reform of rules which prohibit drivers from using smartphones.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239658" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Following the ruling by the Brussels Appeal Court this week, private hire vehicle drivers have also been <a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels-2/195102/uber-demonstration-closes-off-brussels-tunnels/">blocking a major tunnel</a> in the Belgian capital.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a statement on Friday&#8217;s looming shutdown, Uber&#8217;s country chief, Laurent Slits, once again attacked the Belgian government for not delivering a reform it&#8217;s been lobbying for, writing: “This decision was made based on outdated regulations written in a time before smartphones, which the government has promised and failed to reform for the last seven years.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-24/uber-in-brussels-faces-friday-partial-shutdown-after-ruling?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google">Bloomberg</a>, which reported on Uber&#8217;s shutdown earlier, it will not apply to a small number of drivers who are licensed in a Flemish region of the country &#8212; and who will therefore still be allowed to use the app.</p>
<p>Uber confirmed the Appeal Court ruling only affects drivers with Brussels licences.</p>
<p>In the statement, Slits added that the tech giant is &#8220;deeply concerned&#8221; about the 2,000 holders of LVC licenses (aka rental car with driver licences) who he said will &#8220;lose their ability to generate earnings [via Uber&#8217;s platform] from Friday&#8221;.</p>
<p>That phrasing &#8212; &#8220;generate earnings&#8221; &#8212; refers to the fact Uber does not employ drivers directly in Belgium; instead it classifies them as independent contractors. So it cannot claim that 2,000 &#8216;jobs&#8217; are about to be lost since it does not provide employment contracts to the LVC drivers in question in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We urge the government to move quickly to reform the taxi and LVC sector once and for all so that drivers can continue working to provide for their families,” Slits added.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-bans-uber-drivers-from-picking-up-rides-through-the-app/">March</a> the local government in Brussels banned Uber drivers from picking up rides via smartphones and geolocation.</p>
<p>Since then Uber drivers in the city have been operating in a legal grey zone &#8212; where they risk sanctions by continuing to drive using its app. However the company suggests drivers have been given mixed messages, claiming authorities are sometimes telling drivers &#8212; in private &#8212; that they can continue driving.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Uber called the government&#8217;s March order &#8220;mistaken&#8221; &#8212; pointing out that it had promised a reform of the law before the summer. Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uber-temporarily-suspends-brussels-service-first-europe-2021-09-30/">Reuters</a>, a draft law to reform the rules was set out by the Belgian government in September. But, according to Uber, the sector as a whole has yet to see the text.</p>
<p>Uber suggested there is widespread backing in Belgium for reforming the 1995 rules &#8212; not just from LVC drivers who serve customers via its platform but also from traditional taxi firms.</p>
<p>However local taxi firms in Brussels have their own reform ideas &#8212; and have also said they are keen to poach Uber drivers to plug a shortage of taxi drivers.</p>
<p>A sector spokesman recently told <a href="https://www.taxipro.be/ondernemen/2021/09/14/uber-chauffeurs-als-antwoord-op-tekort-taxichauffeurs-brussel/?gdpr=accept&amp;gdpr=accept">TaxiPro</a> there&#8217;s a shortfall of 600+ taxi drivers in the capital which could be filled by LVC holders that have been driving for Uber.</p>
<p>“The big advantage is that we offer a solution to these Uber drivers,” Sam Bouchal told the publication in September [translated to English via Google Translate], saying that the Uber drivers could be offered permanent contracts, and adding: &#8220;We&#8217;re getting them out of illegality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bouchal also told TaxiPro that the taxi sector wants to avoid what he couched as &#8220;a social massacre.&#8221;</p>
<p>Concern over gig working conditions has been a fiery topic across Europe for years, leading to scores of legal challenges &#8212; and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/blow-to-uber-in-europe-as-top-court-rules-its-a-transport-service/">2017 ruling by Europe&#8217;s top court</a> that Uber is a transport service and so cannot simply dodge local taxi regulations.</p>
<p>In the UK, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">Uber was also recently been forced to recognize drivers as workers</a> after losing the last of a long line of employment challenges at the country&#8217;s Supreme Court.</p>
<p>However, in Belgium &#8212; a core centre of power for the European Commission &#8212; the ride-hailing giant is continuing to lobby for favorably changes to the law to grease the engines of its platform business.</p>
<p>Uber is also lobbying the Commission to address ride-hailing regulations across the bloc&#8217;s single market in an upcoming <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12916-Sustainable-transport-new-urban-mobility-framework_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12916-Sustainable-transport-new-urban-mobility-framework_en&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637916941304000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2CuSdq_DOgkYbFhLrJViqg">urban mobility framework</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; which the EU exec has said it wants to support the development of urban transport systems that are &#8220;safe, accessible, inclusive, affordable, smart, resilient and emission-free&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s hope here is that EU lawmakers will seek to apply rules that override city level regulations &#8212; setting a pan-EU enabling framework for ride-hailing services which would mean it could just ignore local authority demands.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How four European cities are embracing micromobility to drive out cars&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars/embed/#?secret=Au8JSMczWf" data-secret="Au8JSMczWf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However the Commission has also said it wants the urban mobility framework to tackle &#8220;transport pollution and congestion&#8221; &#8212; so it&#8217;s not clear how removing regulatory barriers to ride-hailing would be anything other than counterproductive on that front.</p>
<p>Cars remain the least efficient way to transport people around dense urban environments given how much space they require and how relatively few people can be moved around in the space occupied by a single car vs a train, bus, cycling, scooting, walking etc. The rise of micromobility has also fuelled the range of available car alternatives &#8212; so the arguments in favor of cars in cities are shrinking rapidly.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has also led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars/">a number of European cities</a> to dial up their focus on transforming street infrastructure to be more pedestrian and locally focused, also leveraging the rise of micromobility to enact policies that deliberately de-emphasize the car. Simply put, cleaner air and more vibrant local streets (and<a href="https://twitter.com/zachklein/status/1450113164775870468"> school bike trains</a>) are hard to argue against.</p>
<p>While Brussels has not been at the forefront of those developments the city has been <a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/57902/a-campaign-in-brussels-to-reduce-the-number-of-cars-entering-and-leaving-the-city/">seeking to reduce the number of cars</a> on its infamously congested, <a href="https://epha.org/brussels-inhabitants-testify-how-air-pollution-impacts-their-health/">pollution-smogged</a> roads in recent years. So Belgium&#8217;s government may well have reason to pause and consider the implications of any ride-hailing reforms.</p>
<p>In parallel, the European Commission has been working on another legislation initiative &#8212; which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">wants to improve conditions for platform workers</a> across the bloc, responding to high levels of concern over factors such as the lack of job security and precarious earnings.</p>
<p>On that front Uber has also been busy lobbying &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">stands accused</a> of pushing EU lawmakers to reduce standards for platform workers, with critics saying it&#8217;s seeking to replicate its success in overturning a California law that had sought to classify gig workers as employees.</p>
<p>So the street-level battle for Europe&#8217;s social contract is very real.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>The Brussels government has <a href="https://rudivervoort.brussels/news_/le-gouvernement-bruxellois-trouve-un-accord-sur-la-reforme-des-services-taxi-et-lvc/">announced</a> reaching an agreement on the reform of the taxi sector &#8212; which it said would focus on four main objectives: A common legal framework for the sector; improving quality of service for customers; regulating booking platforms; and protecting the local economy.</p>
<p>Uber welcomed the development, issuing a statement describing it as &#8220;an important first step for the 2,000 drivers who have been waiting for reform for seven years&#8221;; and adding that it hopes the government will now<i> &#8220;</i>move quickly to consult LVC drivers and bring this proposal to parliament while also taking immediate action to safeguard drivers’ earnings opportunities, so they can continue to provide for their families”.</p>
<p>However in its statement the Brussels government rebuked Uber for creating a situation of legal risk for LVC drivers, with minister Rudi Vervoort calling out Uber for irresponsibly allowing the sector to develop &#8220;with the legal risk of seeing this device banned&#8221; and for &#8220;misleading&#8221; LVC drivers &#8212; pointing out that since the 2015 ruling which banned UberPop there has been an increase of almost 448% in the number of drivers in the LVC sector with a Brussels plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am deeply touched by the distress of LVC drivers. They are not responsible for this situation,&#8221; Vervoort added.</p>

Today, the company announced it raised $2.8 million in its first funding round to aid the initial launch and then expand further in Europe later in 2022.</p>
<p>Backers in the round include EVIG Group, Stray Dog Capital, E2JDJ, Tet Ventures, Good Seed Ventures, Sustainable Food Ventures and Shio Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239291" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Perfeggt CEO Tanja Bogumil co-founded the company, which is part of Lovely Day Foods GmbH, earlier this year with Gary Lin, EVIG’s founder and CEO, and Bernd Becker, who was a long-time head of R&amp;D for Rügenwalder Mühle, a German vegetarian and vegan meat maker.</p>

<p>“I really believe we deserve better food,” Bogumil told TechCrunch. “My mother’s family is from an agriculture background in small-scale farming, so I have always been conscious of where the food we eat comes from. I turned vegetarian at 12 when my uncle brought me to a slaughterhouse to show me that the sausages I ate were not made the right way. I didn’t fully get what was happening there, but it didn’t feel right or humane.”</p>
<p>Unlike dairy, where there is already sustainability, she believes the egg is still largely untapped. Sure, there are companies making similar plant-based alternatives, like Simply Eggless and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/eat-just-the-alt-protein-company-formerly-known-as-hampton-creek-has-raised-another-200-million/">Just Eat, which raised $200 million</a> earlier in the summer, but worldwide, <a href="https://ew-nutrition.com/us/how-producers-keep-the-egg-supply-chain-going-amid-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1.3 trillion eggs are produced annually</a>, meaning there is room to grow, and applications are versatile, Bogumil said.</p>
<p>Perfeggt’s first plant-based egg product is a protein-rich liquid alternative made from fava beans. It can be prepared as a scrambled egg or omelet in the pan. The company will initially be launching its product with food service organizations.</p>
<p>As with all food, taste is king, and with this product, the co-founders worked to create similar mouth feel, sensory, flavors and textures — all elements that Bogumil says are needed to get people to switch to a plant-based equivalent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This is something we spent time on figuring out,” she added. “Our product is built around the fava bean, which is very suited to mimic functionality required for these applications.”</p>
<p>To do this, Perfeggt’s R&amp;D site in Emsland, Germany works closely with Wageningen University &amp; Research, known for its life sciences research, to test plant-based protein sources and their combinations that come closest to the nutritional and functional properties of animal products.</p>
<p>The new funding enables the company to build out its team at its headquarters and R&amp;D facility. The company is currently hiring for food scientists, marketing and R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bogumil believes that more companies coming into the egg alternative space will help Perfeggt’s mission to shift people to plant-based foods.</p>
<p>“This is not a one-winner-takes-all market,” she said. “We have never in history seen alternative proteins be so close to the mainstream market. Clearly that is reflected in the capital markets, and not just for developing niche markets, but for the future of food.”</p>
<p>“We are incredibly impressed by the team&#8217;s rapid technological progress in developing next-generation alternative proteins and finding solutions that improve human, planetary and animal health,” Stephanie Dorsey, founding partner at E2JDJ, added in a written statement. “The egg market is a massive opportunity and this is just the beginning.&#8221;</p>
