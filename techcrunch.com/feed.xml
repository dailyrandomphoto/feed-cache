										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.carta.com/">Carta</a>, the nine-year-old, San Francisco-based cap table management and valuation software company, just raised $500 million in its eighth round of funding, at a $7.4 billion valuation. That&#8217;s more than double where the company was valued eight months ago when it closed its seventh round of funding at a valuation of $3.1 billion.</p>
<p>With so much money flooding into privately held companies, giant leaps in valuation are no longer all that notable. What&#8217;s different about this particular story is how Carta&#8217;s new valuation was established, which was to run an auction using its own trading platform to sell $100 million of its shares to secondary buyers, then use the valuation at which the shares sold &#8212; $6.9 billion &#8212; as evidence to primary investors of Carta&#8217;s true value.</p>
<p>For a company that&#8217;s trying to raise awareness of its trading platform &#8212; Carta wants to sell more of the secondary shares of other companies, too &#8212; it was a smart marketing play. It was Carta eating its own dog food, in the somewhat repellant parlance of the startup world. Still, it&#8217;s unclear whether we&#8217;re likely to see it replicated by other companies going forward.</p>
<p>First, what Carta did is &#8212; we think &#8212; unprecedented in establishing a price for secondary shares. Typically, a small group comes together and negotiates a price or, if it&#8217;s 20 or more sellers who are willing to offload shares to buyers, it&#8217;s considered a &#8220;tender offer&#8221; and out comes the prospectus-type document, including financial statements, risk factors and all that other jazz, which is sent to a set group of potential buyers.</p>
<p>In Carta&#8217;s case, as Carta CEO Henry Ward suggests in a <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/carta-series-g-3a3702f69b11">new Medium post</a>, by running an auction process, many more investors participated in the price discovery of its shares than might have been possible otherwise. (A <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/finally-a-private-stock-exchange-cartax-3c658f30ac97">prior post</a> by Ward pegs this number at 414 participants that participated in 1484 executed orders.)</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense, says longtime startup attorney Tim Harris of Morrison &amp; Foerster, who was not involved in the process but is a student of market efficiencies. &#8220;Ward is basically saying, &#8216;We&#8217;re using a broader market price-seeking process instead of what he describes as one-off. You see it in real estate listings all the time,&#8221; adds Harris. &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason companies can&#8217;t do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question that startup founders may be wondering right now is whether an auction process like Carta&#8217;s can truly help establish a price for primary shares. Naturally, Ward says it can. Indeed, in his Medium post, he says the auction very much strengthened the case that Carta could make to investors, including Silver Lake, the investment firm that ultimately led Carta&#8217;s newest $500 million round (a Series G).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While we don&#8217;t doubt it was a useful data point, Silver Lake is a sophisticated investment firm has been valuing companies for 21 years; likely, it have arrived at the valuation it did without that earlier auction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are other reasons to think an auction like Carta&#8217;s will remain an outlier. For his part, attorney Anthony McCusker, who cochairs the tech practice at Goodwin Proctor, questions whether &#8220;companies are going to outsource their valuation discovery to Carta.&#8221; Most founders and CEOs would prefer to talk directly with investors when it comes to establishing the valuation of their company rather than leave it to the wisdom of crowds, he suggests.</p>
<p>Markets can also &#8220;be gamed,&#8221; as notes Harris of MoFo, observing that the integrity of any platform &#8220;depends on oversight and the quality of bids on a platform,&#8221; (Harris half-kiddingly wonders what happened, for example, to the bidder who said he or she would pay <a href="https://people.com/human-interest/jeff-bezos-space-flight-auction-winning-bid-28-million-brother-mark/">$28 million</a> to join Jeff Bezos on his trip to space, then later cited &#8220;<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/16/blue_origins_flight/">scheduling conflicts</a>.&#8221;)</p>
<p>As for us, we wonder how many founding teams are willing to open up the secondary sale of their shares to a potentially much wider circle of backers when historically, they have not.</p>
<p>We also wonder whether, for some companies, that discovery process could backfire. After all, Carta is a hot commodity that likely didn&#8217;t need to set a floor for its auction offering. But we can imagine scenarios in which companies&#8217; secondary shares aren&#8217;t worth to outsiders what founders think that they are.</p>
<p>Of course, the industry is changing fast, so very little would surprise us at this point. Indeed, whatever happens, the auction is clearly part of a larger trend toward transparency that continues to play out in interesting new ways all the time.</p>
<p>As Harris notes,  when he began practicing law 26 year ago, &#8220;venture was a completely closed ecosystem.&#8221; Now, he says, &#8220;There&#8217;s a wealth of data being shared and disseminated to maker smarter business decisions. You can just go to Pitchbook or Crunchbase to learn a lot of what you need to know.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">After all the leaks and teases, Lamborghini has finally announced its new hybrid-engine Countach.</p>
<p>Thankfully, almost everything you need to know about the car is in its model designation: LPI 800-4.</p>
<p>The first part is short for Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido, referencing how the powertrain is mounted lengthwise toward the back of the supercar and the fact that it&#8217;s a hybrid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the two numbers point to the approximately 802 horsepower the Countach&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-lamborghini-sian-hybrid-technology-interview.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">V12 6.5-liter engine</a> and 48-volt electric motor can output together, as well as the fact that it has four-wheel drive.</p>
<figure>
<p><div style="width: 685px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-08%2Fe0dbabf0-fc53-11eb-bf3f-9ef15cf71548&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=1fcad3b1e2857e37b1ebad635516b1951f6e0703" alt="Countach LPI 800-4" width="675" height="506" data-uuid="5989dadc-a19b-37b8-9284-658f816c4ba7" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lamborghini</p></div></figure>
<p>All of that makes for one powerful car. The Countach can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in less than three seconds and zero to 124 miles per hour in just under nine seconds. As for a top speed, you can push it to 221 miles per hour, and it has a maximum torque of 531 lb-ft.  <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189751" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2189751 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-13-at-12.52.18-PM.png?w=680" alt="Lamborghini interior" width="680" height="505" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-13-at-12.52.18-PM.png 1340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-13-at-12.52.18-PM.png?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-13-at-12.52.18-PM.png?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-13-at-12.52.18-PM.png?resize=768,571 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-13-at-12.52.18-PM.png?resize=680,505 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-13-at-12.52.18-PM.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189751" class="wp-caption-text">Lamborghini</p></div></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Powering the Countach&#8217;s electric motor is a supercapacitor Lamborghini claims delivers three times more power compared to a lithium-ion battery of the same weight. The automaker says it mounted the electric motor directly to the gearbox to preserve the feeling of power transfer you get from a V12 engine.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Carbon fiber makes up most of the chassis and exterior of the Countach LPI 800-4. &#8220;It imagines how the iconic Countach of the 70s and 80s might have evolved into an elite super sports model of this decade,&#8221; Lamborghini says of the design, which is more reminiscent of the Aventador than its original namesake. Inside, you&#8217;ll find an 8.4-inch touchscreen display that includes CarPlay integration and a button labeled &#8220;Stile.&#8221; Pressing it &#8220;explains the Countach design philosophy to its privileged audience.&#8221;</p>
<figure><img class="aligncenter" src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-08%2F3d4b75a0-fc54-11eb-ab2b-040a245611d6&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=5a0c36bb4a9122e0504d89ae37df4f52f401b0d6" alt="Countach LPI 800-4" data-uuid="076479b9-68b5-3c95-8c5d-e3cecc63e4ba" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div>
</figure>
<p>Speaking of a privileged audience, Lamborghini will only make 112 units of the Countach LPI 800-4. The press release the automaker sent over doesn&#8217;t even mention a price tag. It seems Lamborghini is keen on looking forward, but the Countach was too important not to acknowledge with a limited run.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Five years ago, the playbook for launching a new company involved a tried-and-true list of to-dos. Once you built an awesome product with a catchy name, you’d try to get a feature article on TechCrunch, a front-page hit on Hacker News, hunted on ProductHunt and an AMA on Quora.</p>
<p>While all of these today remain impressive milestones, it’s never been harder to corral eyeballs and hit a breakout adoption trajectory.</p>
<p>In this new decade, it is possible to first out-market your competitor, and then raise lots of money, hire the best team and build, rather than the other way around (building first, then marketing).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Outbound marketing tools and company newsletters are useful, but they’re also a slow burn and offer low conversion in the new creator economy. So where does this leave us?</p>
<p>With audiences spread out over so many platforms, reaching cult status requires some level of hacking. Brand-building is no longer a one-hit game, but an exercise in repetition: It may take four or five times for a user to see your startup’s name or logo to recognize, remember or Google it.</p>
<p>Below are some growth tactics that I hope will help jump-start the effort to building an engaged user base.</p>
<h2>Laying the groundwork for user-generated content</h2>
<p>Before users are evangelists, they are observers. Consider creating a bot to alert you of any product mentions on Twitter, or surface subject-matter discussions on Reddit (“Best tools to manage AWS costs?” or “Which marketplace do you resell your old electronics on?&#8221;), which you can then respond to with thoughtful commentary.</p>
<p>Join relevant communities on Discord, infiltrate Slack groups of relevant conferences (including past iterations of a conference  —  chances are those groups are still alive with activity), follow forums on StackOverflow and engage in the discussions on all these channels.</p>
<p>The more often you post, the better your posts convert. The more your handle appears on newsfeeds, the more likely it will be included on widely quoted “listicles.”</p>

<h2>Build in public …</h2>
<p>Building in public is scary given the speed at which ideas can be copied, but competition will always exist, since new ideas are not born in vacuums. Companies like <a href="https://twitter.com/Railway/status/1411137508331585539">Railway</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Replit">Replit</a> post to Twitter every time they post a new changelog. <a href="https://twitter.com/josephpalbanese/status/1353791249912745984">Stir brands its feature releases as “drops,”</a> similar to streetwear drops.</p>
<p>Building in public can also lend opportunities for virality, which requires drama, comedy or both. Hey.com’s launch was buoyed by Basecamp’s public fight against Apple over existing App Store take rates.</p>
<p>Mmhmm, the virtual camera app that adds TV-presenter flair to video meetings, launched with a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8KhKBLoSMk&amp;t=1s"> viral video</a> that hit over 1.5 million views. The company continues to release entertaining<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mmhmm/videos"> YouTube demos</a> to showcase new use cases.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>

</blockquote>
<h2>… or build in private</h2>
<p>Like an artist teasing an upcoming album, some companies are able to drum up substantial anticipation ahead of exiting stealth mode. When two ex-Apple execs founded Humane, they crafted<a href="https://www.instagram.com/hu.ma.ne/?hl=en"> beautiful social media pages</a> full of sophisticated photography without revealing a single hint of what they set out to build.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sequoia is one of the most prestigious and successful venture firms to ever exist. The firm&#8217;s portfolio includes Airbnb, 23andMe, Docker, Dropbox, Figma and GitHub &#8212; and that barely covers the first half of the alphabet.

<p>Rec Room is a Seattle-based startup that allows users to not only play games, but to build them collaboratively with their friends. The gaming world has seen a huge boost in the wake of the pandemic, and Rec Room is thinking way out in the future about what gaming looks like not only as a user, but as a creator.</p>
<p>The company has raised nearly $150 million, and Sequoia led Rec Room&#8217;s seed and Series A financing rounds.</p>
<p>Stephanie Zhan has been with Sequoia as part of the early-stage and seed investment team, with a portfolio that includes Sunday (outdoor home subscription service), Linear (issues tracking tool for modern developers) and Middesk (background checks for businesses). She has also helped lead investments in Graphcore (microprocessors for machine intelligence), Evervault (dev tools for data privacy) and Doppler (secrets management for developers).</p>
<p>Before joining Sequoia, Zhan held product roles at Google and Nest.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hear from this founder/investor duo about how they met, what made them choose each other and how they&#8217;ve worked together and tackled obstacles moving forward. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-sequoia-capital-and-rec-room?ref=cc6f33dc754d">REGISTER HERE FOR FREE!</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Nearly three in 10 employees (29%) would quit their job if they were told they were no longer allowed to work remotely, according to a <a href="https://www.livecareer.com/resources/careers/planning/is-remote-work-here-to-stay">recent survey.</a> In addition, a recent Harvard Business Study found that “companies that let their workers decide where and when to do their jobs — whether in another city or in the middle of the night — increase employee productivity, reduce turnover and lower organizational costs.”</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months, while instituting a remote work model, our turnover rate at Insightly was the lowest in company history and an internal survey found happiness levels to be twice as high from the previous year. This in the midst of a major pandemic, social movement, forest fires and a disruptive election — all happening at the same time.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As long as your employees are available when your customers are in need and goals are consistently met, 9 to 5 no longer needs to be a thing.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>On a larger, global scale, employers from companies around the world are coming to the same realization: You don’t need an office to be productive and employees are happier working from home.</p>
<p>The next logical step is, at the same time, a majorly disruptive one and a 180-degree shift toward how companies have operated for over 100 years — the transition from in-person headquarters to a remote, work-from-anywhere model. In line with this shift, we’ve foregone our 40,000-square-foot Soma office space and employees are able to work from anywhere in the United States while keeping the same salary.</p>
<p>There will no doubt be challenges, and there already have been. But with these challenges also arises immense opportunity. Here are a few battle-tested tips on how to maintain productivity while delivering flexibility with this new work model:</p>
<h2>Reallocate overhead savings</h2>
<p>Let employees choose where they live. Allowing this option will better their lives and make for happy, engaged employees. Overhead costs, especially in large cities such as San Francisco, are the largest operating expense for most companies. Take this large sum of money and invest in employee happiness. You don’t need thousands of square feet in office space to be successful.</p>
<p>That massive overhead cost you just got rid of? Use this toward more meaningful employee experiences that will enhance their lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/salesforce-wants-salesforce-to-be-the-netflix-of-biz-content/">its new business video streaming service</a> called Salesforce+ this week, everyone had a reaction. While not all of it was positive, some company watchers also wondered if there was more to this announcement than meets the eye.</p>
<p>If you look closely, the new initiative suggests that Salesforce wants to take a bite out of LinkedIn and other SaaS content platforms and publishers. The video streaming service could be a launch point for a broader content platform, where its partners are producing their own content and using Salesforce+ infrastructure to help them advertise to and cultivate their own customers.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On its face, Salesforce+ is a giant, ambitious and quite expensive content marketing play. </span>The company reportedly has hired a large professional staff to produce and manage the content, and built a broadcasting and production studio designed to produce quality shows in-house. It believes that by launching with content from Dreamforce, its highly successful customer conference, attended by tens of thousands people every year pre-pandemic, it can prime the viewing pump and build audience momentum that way, perhaps even using celebrities as it often does at its events to drive audience. It is less clear about the long-term business goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kiddom, a platform that offers a digital curriculum that fits the core standards required by states, announced today that it has raised a $35 million Series C round led by Altos Ventures, with participation from Owl Ventures, Khosla Ventures and Outcomes Collective. The financing came nearly three years after Kiddom’s Series B, <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2018/03/kiddom-raises-15m-in-series-b-funding.html">a $15 million round led by Owl.</a></p>
<p>The startup didn’t just raise money, it finally learned how to make some. Founded in 2012, Kiddom was able to raise millions without revenue or a clear business model. But Ahsan Rizvi, CEO and co-founder of Kiddom, and Abbas Manjee, chief academic officer and co-founder of Kiddom, think an early focus on adoption instead of monetization was necessary.</p>
<p>“At our Series B, we were definitely not making money,” Manjee said. “But we have a free product that teachers and students use, and the idea was to build an enterprise product on top of it.” It’s a common strategy with bottom up sales. For example, ClassDojo prioritized adoption for years before it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/">finally introduced a paying version of its classroom socialization product.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="blCidMHSe8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/">ClassDojo&#8217;s second act comes with first profits</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;ClassDojo&#8217;s second act comes with first profits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/embed/#?secret=blCidMHSe8" data-secret="blCidMHSe8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Kiddom poured most of its capital into research and development into its enterprise product. It has two parts. First, it offers a platform that helps schools integrate all of their different platforms into an interface that tracks student utilization and achievement. Second, it offers that platform alongside the product it&#8217;s built up for years, a digital curriculum that fits in with Common Core, a set of math and English academic standards that students are required to learn on a grade by grade level. The latter is perhaps the hardest sell for Kiddom, but also the most lucrative.</p>
<p>Manjee explained vendor approval processes across the States can take a long time, and the stakes are high since decision-makers will only turn to a handful of vendors when it comes to meeting core standards.</p>
<p>A lot of Kiddom’s success depends on if traditional curriculum providers, like the Pearsons and McGraw-Hills of the world, don’t catch up to the digitization of education. Rizvi explained that older companies are “losing market share rapidly” right now. Last year, McGraw-Hill and Cengage <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-05-04-cengage-mcgraw-hill-terminate-proposed-merger-amid-regulatory-scrutiny">terminated a proposed merger</a> that would’ve added some fresh competition to the curriculum world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product has resonated with some users. While Kiddom declined to give specifics, it said that new ARR growth grew 2,525% its first year. In 2020 to 2021, ARR growth is on track to be 300%. It said that at least one teacher uses its product in 70% of schools in the United States, a metric <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-03-14-no-kidding-this-pre-revenue-edtech-startup-just-raised-15m-in-series-b-funding">that has remained consistent since 2018.</a></p>
<p>Kiddom’s fresh funding and revenue shows that its years of product development have kept it competitive in the eyes of investors, synergistic unicorns and the stingiest enterprise customer of them all, school districts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has extended the option of using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/end-to-end-encryption/">end-to-end encryption</a> for Messenger voice calls and video calls.</p>
<p>End-to-end encryption (E2EE) — a security feature that prevents third-parties from eavesdropping on calls and chats —<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/08/messenger-adds-end-to-end-encryption/"> has been available for text conversations on Facebook&#8217;s flagship messaging service since 2016</a>. Although the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/facebook-is-being-leant-on-by-us-uk-australia-to-ditch-its-end-to-end-encryption-expansion-plan/">has faced pressure from governments to roll back</a> its end-to-end encryption plans, Facebook is now extending this protection to both voice and video calls on Messenger, which means that &#8220;nobody else, including Facebook, can see or listen to what’s sent or said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;End-to-end encryption is already widely used by apps like WhatsApp to keep personal conversations safe from hackers and criminals,&#8221; Ruth Kricheli, director of product management for Messenger, said in a <a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/08/13/messenger-updates-end-to-end-encrypted-chats-with-new-features/">blog post</a> on Friday. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;It’s becoming the industry standard and works like a lock and key, where just you and the people in the chat or call have access to the conversation.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook has some other E2EE features in the works, too. It&#8217;s planning to start public tests of end-to-end encryption for group chats and calls in Messenger in the coming weeks and is also planning a limited test of E2EE for Instagram direct messages. Those involved in the trial will be able to opt-in to end-to-end encrypted messages and calls for one-on-one conversations carried out on the photo-sharing platform.</p>
<p>Beyond encryption, the social networking giant is also updating its expiring messages feature, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-now-lets-you-post-disappearing-messages-which-go-away-after-7-days/">which is similar to the ephemeral messages feature available on Facebook-owned WhatsApp</a>. It&#8217;s now offering more options for people in the chat to choose the amount of time before all new messages disappear, from as few as five seconds to as long as 24 hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;People expect their messaging apps to be secure and private, and with these new features, we’re giving them more control over how private they want their calls and chats to be,&#8221; Kricheli added.</p>
<p>News of Facebook ramping up its E2EE rollout plans comes just days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/oh-facebook-changed-its-privacy-settings-again/">the company changed its privacy settings</a> — again.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Do you remember the first time you received a personalized ad? Perhaps you discussed a product with a friend, and the next day, an advertisement for that product popped up on social media. It almost makes you think someone’s listening to your conversations, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Over time, consumers have become increasingly skeptical about ads like these — and for good reason. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-110/Accenture-See-People-Not-Patterns.pdf%23zoom%3D50&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1622651160731000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2VrjdFwMISWa9DFW-ubpvA">A 2019 Accenture study</a> found many customers felt brands communicated in a way they felt was too personal — and 71% of those customers worried how the brands had acquired personal information they hadn’t voluntarily shared.</p>
<p>First-, second- and third-party data make it possible to generate hyperpersonalized ads. But these data collection efforts fall short. Consumers find these methods invasive and a breach of trust — and the data collected is often inaccurate. Google’s third-party cookie is going away, and Apple has made recent changes to its Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), but no one has clarified the effect of these changes on advertisers’ or marketers’ abilities to reach and remarket consumers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Many advertisers have begun leveraging AOOH as a more significant part of their brand and marketing strategy to improve reach, frequency and overall business outcomes.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s not so much that customers <em>don’t </em>appreciate ads targeting their interests — the concern lies in the methods marketers use to collect data and how consumers can maintain control over what personal data they choose to share. Interestingly, as consumer demands for personalization have increased, according to the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/postclick_prod/2021/04/The-2021-State-of-Ad-Personalization-Report-updated.pdf">2021 State of Ad Personalization report</a>, half of marketers have yet to invest in ad personalization.</p>
<p>Personalization and data play a vital role in the success of marketing and advertising campaigns today. Brands and their marketing departments must think outside the box and use a more targeted medium not predicated on invading privacy but designed, nevertheless, to provide a unique, personalized experience for in-store shoppers: audio out-of-home (AOOH) technology.</p>
<p>AOOH technology does not request the use of personal data to work effectively. Instead, it focuses on the in-store customer experience. AOOH broadcasts premium music and programmatic advertisements to enrich customer experiences and reach shoppers directly at the point of sale, influencing buying decisions and positively impacting sales.</p>
<h2>The current generation of personalization and data collection</h2>
<p>In the marketing world, personalization has many nuances. Ultimately, marketers see its goal as providing a unique experience to every individual based on personal preferences and data. The current generation of personalization in marketing is <em>not</em> about collecting cookies or third-party data, merchandising or guesswork.</p>
<p>Today’s personalization focuses instead on delivering the <em>right</em> content, the <em>right</em> offer, the <em>right</em> channel and, most importantly, the <em>right</em> sequence of events generating value exchange between the brand and the consumer.</p>
<p>Although consumers don&#8217;t trust superpersonalized ads, they still expect brands to offer a personalized experience. Ninety-one percent of consumers polled in another <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-77/accenture-pulse-survey.pdf">Accenture study</a> indicated a willingness to shop brands with some form of personalization.</p>
<p>On the other hand, personalization in audio advertising has seen significant growth over the past 15 years, as reflected by a willingness by brands to invest in this medium. A recent report predicts an astonishing <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1176/online-advertising/">84% growth in digital audio ad revenue for 2025 compared to 2019</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From Instagram’s Reels to Snapchat’s Spotlight, most social media platforms are looking toward the TikTok boom for inspiration. Now, even Reddit, a discussion-based forum, is making short-form video more pronounced on its iOS app.</p>
<p>According to Reddit, most iOS users should have a button on their app directly to the right of the search bar &#8212; when tapped, it will show a stream of videos in a TikTok-like configuration. When presented with a video, (which shows the poster who uploaded it and the subreddit it&#8217;s from), users can upvote or downvote, comment, gift an award or share it. Like TikTok, users can swipe up to see another video, feeding content from subreddits the user is subscribed to, as well as related ones. For instance, if you&#8217;re subscribed to r/printmaking, you might see content from r/pottery or r/bookbinding.</p>

<p>The user interface of the videos isn’t new &#8212; Reddit has been experimenting with this format over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/l7s7do/my_video_view_of_reddit_is_like_tiktok_now_how_do/">the last year</a>. But before, this manner of watching Reddit videos was only accessible by tapping on a video while scrolling through your feed &#8212; rather than promoting discovery of other communities, the first several videos recommended would be from the same subreddit.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189486" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189486" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2189486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reddit.jpg?w=680" alt="Images of new Reddit features" width="680" height="374" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reddit.jpg 2250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reddit.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reddit.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reddit.jpg?resize=768,423 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reddit.jpg?resize=680,374 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reddit.jpg?resize=1536,845 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reddit.jpg?resize=2048,1127 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/reddit.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189486" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reddit, screenshots by TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Reddit’s mission is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world, and subsequently, Reddit’s video team’s mission is to bring community through video,” a Reddit spokesperson told TechCrunch, about the new addition. &#8220;Over the course of the last year, our goal was to build a unified video player, and re-envision the player interface to match what users (new and old) expect when it comes to an in-app video player &#8212; especially commenting, viewing, engaging and discovering new content and communities through video,&#8221; they noted.</p>
<p>Reddit doesn’t yet have a timeline for when the feature will roll out to everyone, but confirmed that this icon first appeared for some users in late July and has continued to roll out to almost all iOS users. But by placing a broader, yet still personalized video feed on the home screen, Reddit is signaling a growing curiosity in short form video. In December 2020, Reddit acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/reddit-acquires-dubsmash/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Dubsmash</a>, a Brooklyn-via-Berlin-based TikTok competitor. The terms of the deals were undisclosed, but Facebook and Snap also <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-snap-held-talks-to-buy-tiktok-rival-dubsmash">reportedly showed interest</a> in the platform, which hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/dubsmash-songs/">1 billion monthly views</a> in January 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reddit declined to comment on whether or not its new video player is using an algorithm to promote discovery of new subreddits based on user activity. However, a Reddit spokesperson confirmed that the company will use Dubsmash&#8217;s technology to develop other features down the road, though not for this particular product, they said.</p>
<p>Reddit first launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/reddit-rolls-out-its-own-video-platform/">native video platform</a> in 2017, which allows users to upload MP4 and MOV files to the site. Then, in August 2019, it launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20812887/reddit-live-streaming-test-public-access-network-rpan-subreddit-tool">RPAN</a> (Reddit Public Access Network), which lets people livestream to selected subreddits &#8212; the most popular livestreams are promoted across the platform. Reddit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/">currently attracts</a> 50 million daily active visitors and hosts 100,000 active subreddits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automation will displace 85 million jobs while simultaneously creating 97 million new jobs by 2025, according to the World Economic Forum. Although that sounds like good news, the hard reality is that millions of people will have to retrain in the jobs of the future.</p>
<p>A number of startups are addressing these problems of employee skills, and are looking at talent development, neuroscience-based assessments and prediction technologies for staffing. These include Pymetrics (raised $56.6 million), Eightfold (raised $396.8 million) and EmPath (raised $1 million). But this sector is by no means done yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://retrain.ai">Retrain.ai</a> bills itself as a &#8220;Talent Intelligence Platform&#8221;, and it’s now closed an additional $7 million from its current investors Square Peg, Hetz Ventures, TechAviv, .406 Ventures and Schusterman Family Investments. It’s also now added Splunk Ventures as a strategic investor. The new round of funding takes its total raised to $20 million.</p>
<p>R<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">etrain.ai says it uses AI and machine learning to help governments and organizations retrain and upskill talent for jobs of the future, enable diversity initiatives, and help employees and jobseekers manage their careers.</span></p>
<p>Dr. Shay David, co-founder and CEO of retrain.ai said: “We are thrilled to have Splunk Ventures join us on this exciting journey as we use the power of data to solve the widening skills gap in the global labor markets.”</p>
<p>The company says it helps companies tackle future workforce strategies by “analyzing millions of data sources to understand the demand and supply of skill sets.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will be used for U.S. expansion, hiring talent and product development.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Either the neoinsurance companies' long-term models will come to fruition thanks to large cash balances providing runway to prove their point, or Wall Street is correct -- they were always overvalued.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an awful week for public neoinsurance companies. A subsector of the larger insurtech world, neoinsurance providers tackled a number of insurance categories using a blend of modern app design and machine learning in hopes of creating more user-friendly and profitable insurance products.</p>
<p>The idea proved attractive to venture capitalists, who invested in a host of companies working on the problem space. And it went so well that in the last year or so we saw a number of U.S. neoinsurance companies go public.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>That&#8217;s the extent of the good news. Since the IPOs and SPAC combinations that took MetroMile, Hippo, Lemonade and Root public, the group has seen their values either <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/24/should-we-be-worried-about-insurtech-valuations/">decline sharply</a> below their initial trading prices or far under their recent highs.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve covered some of these declines in recent weeks and wondered if we should be worried about neoinsurance valuations and how they may impact startups. This morning, we&#8217;re examining what happened to neoinsurance companies this week, why, and which startups could be impacted.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Grounding our work is an interview that The Exchange held with <a href="https://ir.joinroot.com/board-member/director-1">Root CEO Alex Timm</a> in the wake of his company&#8217;s earnings report. It&#8217;s a pretty illustrative example of where the sector finds itself today: Flush, busy and somewhat unloved.</p>
<h2>Recent declines</h2>
<p>Measuring from last Friday&#8217;s closing price to yesterday&#8217;s, here&#8217;s a digest of where the market is for public neoinsurance companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hippo: -20%.</li>
<li>MetroMile: -30%.</li>
<li>Root: -23%.</li>
<li>Lemonade: -6%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Declines from recent highs are more extreme for several of the now-public neoinsurance companies, something that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/a-lot-of-cash-and-little-love-an-insurtech-story/?tpcc=ECTW2020">discussed last Friday</a>. The point we made then has only become more acute. We could add names to this list, like Oscar Health, but health insurance feels sufficiently distinct from the above companies that I don&#8217;t want to muddy the waters.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new in all of this is that the value of some of these companies is getting close to their cash balance. Or more simply, they are trending toward basement-level enterprise values. Here&#8217;s the data:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollars keep flowing into Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Argentine personal finance management app Ualá announced it has raised $350 million in a Series D round at a post-money valuation of $2.45 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Latin America Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and affiliates of China-based Tencent co-led the round, which included participation from a slew of existing backers, including funds managed by Soros Fund Management LLC, funds managed by affiliates of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Ribbit Capital, Greyhound Capital, Monashees and Endeavor Catalyst. New funds, such as D1 Capital Partners and 166 2nd, also put money in the round in addition to angel investors such as Jacqueline Reses and Isaac Lee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round is believed to be the largest private raise ever by an Argentinian company and brings Ualá’s total raised to $544 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder and CEO Pierpaolo Barbieri, a Buenos Aires native and Harvard University graduate, has said his ambition was to create a platform that would bring all financial services into one app linked to one card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://www.uala.com.ar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ualá</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says it has developed “a complete financial ecosystem,” including universal accounts, a global Mastercard card, bill payment options, investment products, personal loans, installments (BNPL) and insurance. It has also launched merchant acquiring, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ualá Bis,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a solution for entrepreneurs and merchants that allows selling through a payment link or mobile point-of-sales (mPOS). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has issued more than 3.5 million cards in its home country and in Mexico, where it launched operations last year. The company claims that more than 22% of 18 to 25-year-olds in Argentina have a Ualá card. At the time of its Series C raise in November 2019, it had issued 1.3 million cards.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189559" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189559" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2189559 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ualá-2-e1628867223791.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189559" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ualá</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 1 million users invest in the mutual fund available on the Ualá app, which the company claims is the second largest mutual fund in Argentina in number of participants. The company, which has aimed to provide more financial transparency and inclusion in the region, says that 65% of its users had no credit history prior to downloading the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ualá plans to use its new capital to continue expanding within Latin America, develop new business verticals and do some hiring, with the plan of having 1,500 employees by year’s end. It currently has more than 1,000 employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are most impressed by Ualá&#8217;s ambition and execution. Our investment will propel the next stage of their vision, furthering a regional ecosystem that can make financial services more accessible and transparent across LatAm,” said Marcelo Claure, CEO of SoftBank Group International and COO of SoftBank Group, in a written statement.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>Our beloved<a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton"> Danny</a> was back, joining <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> to chat through yet another incredibly busy week. As a window into our process, every week we tell one another that the <em>next</em> week we&#8217;ll cut the show down to size. Then the week is so interesting that we end up cutting a lot of news, but also keeping a lot of news. The chaotic process is a work in progress, but it means that the end result is always what we decided we can&#8217;t not talk about.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>A little URL to IRL update from Natasha, who just got back<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1425532382216527874"> from an edtech conference</a>.</li>
<li>How <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/atv-venture-capital-ransomware/">one VC got hit by ransomware,</a> and why stolen LP data could be a wake-up call for investors.</li>
<li>The crew chatted through some <a href="https://www.bvp.com/atlas/the-cloud-100-benchmarks-report?from=feature">Cloud 100 numbers</a>, and riffed for a minute on Figma, Gusto and Mailchimp, companies all reportedly worth around the $10 billion mark.</li>
<li>From the early-stage funding round side of things, we noodled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/surfside-a-marketing-technology-for-the-cannabis-space-inhales-4-million/">on Surfside&#8217;s $4 million raise</a>, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/pave-gets-y-combinator-to-back-better-startup-compensation-tools-again/">capital that Pave recently attracted</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/felt-raised-4-5-million-to-get-you-to-think-in-maps/">Felt also raised money</a> to make maps more mainstream, which had us thinking about use cases galore.</li>
<li>In unicorn-land, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/turkeys-first-decacorn-trendyol-raises-1-5b-at-a-16-5b-valuation/">Trendyol raised a mountain of cash</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/india-upgrad-enters-unicorn-club-with-185-million-fundraise/">UpGrad became India&#8217;s newest unicorn</a>.</li>
<li>Climate change is going to mean lots more companies need to handle disaster prep, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/following-the-ipccs-report-we-need-more-technology-to-respond-to-more-disasters/">Danny argues</a>. His recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1/">EC-1 here about RapidSOS </a>got into the deep and complex world of three simple numbers: 911.</li>
<li>And we ended the show with a riff on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/salesforce-wants-salesforce-to-be-the-netflix-of-biz-content/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Salesforce+</a>, which we had fun with but also tried to take seriously because we are journalists after all.</li>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">“We are not a social impact company. No more societal and political discussions on our company account.”</p>
<p>That’s been the recent message from a number of tech CEOs who have declared that they want the companies they run to be “apolitical” and employees to focus solely on the goals of growing revenue and driving profit.</p>
<p>That’s left me wondering: What might that mean for me as an LGBTQIA+ person in the workplace?</p>
<p>I don’t consider myself a particularly political person. I just want to do a good job, be a supportive team member and leader, and play a valuable role in the organization that employs me. I’m lucky to work as chief information security officer at Elastic, a software company that prioritizes inclusivity and acceptance for all employees, telling us to come as we are.</p>
<p>But what if things were different?</p>
<p>If I worked for a different company, would being a gay woman who’s out at work make me “political?” Would talking with colleagues about my home life and my family be considered a political act?</p>
<p>It would all depend, I guess, on whom you asked. I’m well aware that, to certain people, being out in the workforce might be considered political &#8212; but I’m just being open and transparent about who I am.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Staying in the shadows</h2>
<p>When we consider who gets to define what’s political or not, we need to think hard about the level of privilege they enjoy &#8212; and whom they might be excluding from everyday workplace conversations.</p>

<p>Managers and executives who insist on an apolitical workplace are inevitably asking some employees, particularly those belonging to historically underrepresented groups, to stay in the shadows, to keep quiet about who they are.</p>
<p>I’ve been there and I’ve felt the impact firsthand. Earlier in my career, I hid my sexual orientation. I wore a virtual mask at work, and it was exhausting and stressful to have to worry about who knew my “secret” and what might happen if the truth got out.</p>
<p>It was also a significant distraction from doing my job. Even if bosses aren’t concerned about the emotional impact of mandating an apolitical workplace on their employees, they might at the very least consider the productivity impact.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/lgbtq-employee-satisfaction/">survey</a> from online careers site Glassdoor found that LGBTQ+ employees are less satisfied at work compared to their non-LGBTQ+ counterparts, and that while certain companies and industries are highly rated by LGBTQ+ employees, many others still have considerable progress to make.</p>
<p>Since it’s no secret that less satisfied employees are likely to be less engaged, that could potentially send corporate metrics that focus on productivity, performance and retention into a nosedive.</p>
<p>Conversely, a 2020 <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/understanding-organizational-barriers-to-a-more-inclusive-workplace">report</a> published by strategy firm McKinsey suggests that diversity helps organizations increase innovation, reconsider entrenched ways of thinking and improve financial performance &#8212; but also stresses that they only enjoy these benefits if all employees feel a sense of inclusion. The study’s authors define this as “the degree to which an individual feels that their authentic selves are welcomed at work, enabling them to contribute in a meaningful and deliberate manner.”</p>
<p>The firm’s survey of almost 2,000 employees, across a wide range of companies and industries worldwide, shows clearly that women, respondents from ethnic and racial minorities, and people who identify as LGBTQ+ still encounter additional challenges to feeling included.</p>
<h2>Working from home</h2>
<p>On top of all this, it’s not realistic to ask people to leave their personal lives and beliefs at home after huge numbers of employees began working from home on a full-time basis amid the pandemic, many for the first time ever. If strict lines between their personal and professional lives were clearer for some employees pre-COVID, those days are almost certainly over.</p>
<p>While the pandemic forced many organizations to restructure the workplace, I’ve been working in a fully remote, distributed environment since joining Elastic in 2018. This has shaped how I manage my team because every individual has their own perceptions and experiences, all of which can be more challenging to identify in a distributed workforce. In particular, I’ve learned that building an inclusive, high-functioning team starts with empathetic leadership.</p>
<p>For me, it’s all about being present, asking questions and not making assumptions. When everyone is working in their own environment, it’s easy to postulate about how someone’s feeling about their work or a particular project, because that’s human nature &#8212; but the danger here is that we jump to the negative. Staying curious and seeking to understand is key at all times.</p>
<p>Above all, it’s about inclusion and acceptance. Giving everyone the freedom to express what’s on their mind. That’s how everyone should feel about their workplace, and it’s the environment I will continue to work to foster for my own team &#8212; because oftentimes, the personal <em>is</em> political, and companies are made up of people, not products.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Orchata's mobile app enables consumers in Mexico to get groceries delivered in 15 minutes with no substitutes and at supermarket prices.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luis Mario Garcia grew up in Mexico making deliveries for the grocery stores in his neighborhood. After honing his startup skills in San Francisco, he returned to Mexico with the idea of building a software company.</p>
<p>That’s when he met his co-founder Javier Gonzalez and the pair started <a href="https://orchata.com/">Orchata</a> in 2020, a mobile app enabling consumers to get groceries delivered in 15 minutes, with no substitutes and at supermarket prices. Products delivered include fresh fruit, beverages, bread, medicine and household essentials, Garcia told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Orchata does this by operating a network of micro fulfillment centers — it is already operating in two cities — with technology for efficient picking and hyperfast delivery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/6732/online-food-delivery-in-latin-america/">Online food delivery sales in Latin America</a> are projected to reach $9.8 billion by 2024, with the global pandemic driving demand for faster delivery, according to Statista. Garcia sees three different waves in this market: the first one being traditional supermarkets, where you can spend hours, which led to the second wave of food delivery companies, including some big players in the region — for example Rappi in Colombia, which in July raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/colombian-on-demand-delivery-startup-rappi-raises-over-500m-at-a-5-25b-valuation/">$500 million in Series F funding at a $5.25 billion valuation</a> in a round led by T. Rowe Price, and Cornershop in Chile, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/11/uber-to-acquire-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/">acquired by Uber</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>However, Garcia said many of these services still take more than an hour from order to doorstep and may require phone calls if an item is not available. He wants to be part of a third wave — software that is integrated with inventory and delivery that is super fast, and no substitutions.</p>

<p>“This is similar to what is going on around the world, but there is a huge opportunity to bring convenience, to be the Gopuff for Latin America, and we want to build it first in the region,” Garcia said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Monterrey-based company was part of Y Combinator’s summer 2020 cohort and on Friday announced a $4 million seed round from a group of investors, including Y Combinator, JAM Fund, FJ Labs, Venture Friends, Investo and Foundation Capital, and angel investors Ross Lipson, Mike Hennessey, Brian Requarth and Javier Mata.</p>
<p>Jonathan Lewy, co-founder of Grin Scooters and founder of Investo, is also an investor in Rappi. He said Garcia was building a product for the end user, with the key being the building of the infrastructure and inventory. Lewy believes Garcia understands how quick delivery should be done and that it is not just about offering a mobile app, but building the technology behind it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Justin Mateen, general partner at JAM Fund, and co-founder of Tinder and an early-stage investor, met Garcia over a year ago and was one of the company’s first investors. He said Garcia’s and Gonzalez’s initial idea for the model of grocery stores was still not solving the problem, but then they pivoted to doing fulfillment and inventory themselves.</p>
<p>“He fits the mold of what I look for in a founder, and he is the type of founder that doesn’t give up,” Mateen said. “Luis finally agreed to let me double down on my investment. The model makes sense now, he is on to something and it is now going to be about execution of capital as he scales.”</p>
<p>Both Mateen and Lewy agree that there will be similar apps coming because food delivery is such a large market, but that Orchata has a clear advantage of owning the customer experience from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Having only launched four months ago, Orchata is already processing thousands of orders and is seeing 100% monthly growth. The new funding will enable Orchata to expand into three new cities in Mexico. Garcia is also eyeing Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Chile for future expansion.</p>
<p>The company is also targeting multiple use cases, including someone noticing a forgotten item while cooking to consumers shopping for the week or teenagers needing food for a party.</p>
<p>“We are going to be super convenient to customers, and we think every use case for food delivery will be this way in the future,” Garcia said. “We will eventually introduce our own brands and foods with the goal of being that app that is there anytime you need it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ThirdAI is building tools to speed up deep learning technology without the need for hardware like graphics processing units.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Houston-based <a href="https://thirdai.com">ThirdAI</a>, a company building tools to speed up deep learning technology without the need for specialized hardware like graphics processing units, brought in $6 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Neotribe Ventures, Cervin Ventures and Firebolt Ventures co-led the investment, which will be used to hire additional employees and invest in computing resources, Anshumali Shrivastava, Third AI co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Shrivastava, who has a mathematics background, was always interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially rethinking how AI could be developed in a more efficient manner. It was when he was at Rice University that he looked into how to make that work for deep learning. He started ThirdAI in April with some Rice graduate students.</p>
<p>ThirdAI’s technology is designed to be “a smarter approach to deep learning,” using its algorithm and software innovations to make general-purpose central processing units (CPU) faster than graphics processing units for training large neural networks, Shrivastava said. Companies abandoned CPUs years ago in favor of graphics processing units that could more quickly render high-resolution images and video concurrently. The downside is that there is not much memory in graphics processing units, and users often hit a bottleneck while trying to develop AI, he added.</p>
<p>“When we looked at the landscape of deep learning, we saw that much of the technology was from the 1980s, and a majority of the market, some 80%, were using graphics processing units, but were investing in expensive hardware and expensive engineers and then waiting for the magic of AI to happen,” he said.</p>
<p>He and his team looked at how AI was likely to be developed in the future and wanted to create a cost-saving alternative to graphics processing units. Their algorithm, “sub-linear deep learning engine,” instead uses CPUs that don’t require specialized acceleration hardware.</p>
<p>Swaroop “Kittu” Kolluri, founder and managing partner at Neotribe, said this type of technology is still early. Current methods are laborious, expensive and slow, and for example, if a company is running language models that require more memory, it will run into problems, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“That’s where ThirdAI comes in, where you can have your cake and eat it, too,” Kolluri said. “It is also why we wanted to invest. It is not just the computing, but the memory, and ThirdAI will enable anyone to do it, which is going to be a game changer. As technology around deep learning starts to get more sophisticated, there is no limit to what is possible.”</p>
<p>AI is already at a stage where it has the capability to solve some of the hardest problems, like those in healthcare and seismic processing, but he notes there is also a question about climate implications of running AI models.</p>
<p>“Training deep learning models can be more expensive than having five cars in a lifetime,” Shrivastava said. “As we move on to scale AI, we need to think about those.”</p>

<p>In the new letter, Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Jon Ossoff (D-GA) press Jassy for details about how Amazon plans to expand its biometric payment system and if the data collected will help the company target ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon’s expansion of biometric data collection through Amazon One raises serious questions about Amazon’s plans for this data and its respect for user privacy, including about how Amazon may use the data for advertising and tracking purposes,&#8221; the senators wrote in the letter, embedded below.</p>
<p>The lawmakers also requested information on how many people have enrolled in Amazon One to date, how Amazon will secure the sensitive data and if the company has ever paired the palm prints with facial recognition data it collects elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;In contrast with biometric systems like Apple’s Face ID and Touch ID or Samsung Pass, which store biometric information on a user’s device, Amazon One reportedly uploads biometric information to the cloud, raising unique security risks,&#8221; the senators wrote. &#8220;&#8230; Data security is particularly important when it comes to immutable customer data, like palm prints.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company controversially introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/">$10 credit for new users</a> who enroll their palm prints in the program, prompting an outcry from privacy advocates who see it as a cheap tactic to coerce people to hand over sensitive personal data.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of reason to be skeptical. Amazon has faced fierce criticism for its other big biometric data project, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/17/amazon-shareholders-want-the-company-to-stop-selling-facial-recognition-to-law-enforcement/">AI facial recognition software known as Rekognition</a>, which the company provided to U.S. law enforcement agencies before eventually backtracking with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/amazon-rekognition-moratorium/">moratorium on policing applications</a> for the software last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food delivery apps offer convenience for customers, but a host of headaches for restaurants, like commissions <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/14/856444431/cities-crack-down-on-food-delivery-app-fees-as-restaurants-struggle-to-survive">as high as 40% </a>and very few tools to build customer loyalty. Based in Singapore, <a href="https://www.tablevibe.co/">Tablevibe</a> wants to help restaurants reduce their reliance on third-party delivery apps and help them get more direct orders and returning customers. The startup is part of Y Combinator’s current batch, which will hold its Demo Day at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Tablevibe’s founding team includes two former Googlers: Jeroen Rutten, formerly head of Google Search’s product strategy in APAC, and Sneep, who was responsible for its app development go-to-market strategy and led large sales teams. They are joined by Guido Caldara, a lead teacher at coding bootcamp Le Wagon and Tablevibe’s chief technology officer.</p>
<p>The idea for Tablevibe came after Rutten, its chief executive officer, visited a restaurant in Singapore that used paper feedback forms.</p>
<p>“We thought, if they use a paper feedback form, it actually creates a lot of hassle, like entering all the data into an Excel spreadsheet,” he told TechCrunch. “How’s the restaurant owner going to get actionable feedback based on data in an Excel spreadsheet?”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The hidden cost of food delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/the-hidden-cost-of-food-delivery/embed/#?secret=6NkVFr2jNN" data-secret="6NkVFr2jNN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The team began working on the first version of Tablevibe, with simple Google Forms for dine-in customers and Google Data Studio dashboards, and tested it with three restaurants a few months before COVID-19 emerged. They found that using Tablevibe instead of paper forms increased response rates by up to 26x and also had the benefit of creating more repeat customers, since they are given an incentive for filling out surveys.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic hit and restaurants had to suddenly pivot to deliveries. The team kept the same idea behind their feedback forms, but started using QR codes affixed to takeout packaging. The QR codes (usually in the form of stickers so food and beverage businesses don’t need to order new packaging) also offer an incentive if customers scan it and fill out a survey — but the discount or free item can’t be redeemed through third-party delivery apps, only through direct orders with the restaurant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Restaurants can customize surveys, but about 80% use Tablevibe’s templates, which are quick to fill out, since most questions just ask for a rating from one to five stars (there’s also an optional form for customers to write their opinions). Customers fill out their name and email addresses, then rank the food and atmosphere (for dine-in). For delivery, customers are also asked which app they used.</p>

<p>Tablevibe is integrated with Google Reviews, so if someone gives the restaurant a high rating, they are asked if they want to make it public. They also have the option to follow its Facebook or Instagram profile.</p>
<p>For dine-in customers, Tablevibe primarily works with F&amp;B businesses that have multiple venues, including Merci Marcel and Lo and Behold Group. For its delivery survey, most users are smaller restaurants that have one location. It also serves cloud kitchens, like CloudEats in the Philippines.</p>
<p>“As a restaurant, you want to own and grow your customer relationships,” said Sneep, Tablevibe’s chief operating officer. “The first part is actually knowing who your customers are, what they experienced and how you can contact them, which is how we can help. The second piece is growing a customer relationship, which we do by giving a reward, but only if a customer reorders directly with a restaurant.”</p>
<p>Customers have generated over 25,000 reviews through Tablevibe so far, which gives the company data to help determine what kind of incentives will convince someone to scan a restaurant’s QR code and take a survey.</p>
<p>Tablevibe’s founders say it can deliver more than 100x return on investment to its clients. For example, Merci Marcel did an evaluation and determined that it got a 103x ROI, based on the number of customers who claimed incentives, average order value, how many people left a five-star Google Review and how much more business those reviews drove to their venues.</p>
<p>The startup plans to expand into other English-speaking markets, focusing first on Northern Europe and then North America later this year. Aside from Singapore, it’s already used by customers in the Philippines, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Portugal.</p>
<p>Rutten said that Tablevibe plans to build its development team, with the goal of becoming a “Salesforce for restaurants” that can help them build engagement through delivery or dine-ins, capture data and turn them into useful insights.</p>
<p>“Our roadmap has two levers — one is to get more data and the other is to provide more intelligence,” he said. “We’re working on API integrations so Tablevibe can integrate with point-of-sale systems. The second thing is to pull in more publicly available data from sources like Google Reviews. We will also build out more marketing features to leverage customer databases so businesses can send out emails about new restaurant launches, etc.” Eventually, Tablevibe also plans to use AI to help restaurants determine exactly what they need to do to improve customer experience, like change a menu item.</p>
