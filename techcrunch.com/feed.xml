										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An Indian court rejected <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/future-group" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="future-group">Future Group&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plea that sought to prevent its partner <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> from interfering in &#8212; and blocking &#8212; the Indian retail giant&#8217;s $3.4 billion asset sale deal to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, delivering a glimmer of hope to the American e-commerce firm that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested more than $6.5 billion</a> in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Future Group was seeking an ad-interim injunction to restrain its partner Amazon from writing to regulators and other authorities to raise concerns over &#8212; and halt &#8212; the deal between the two Indian giants. The Delhi High Court ruled on Monday that Amazon cannot be barred from writing to regulators and authorities on account of &#8220;potentially irreparable damage.&#8221; The regulators will decide whether the deal should be approved in accordance with the law, the court said.</p>
<p>The ruling is the latest episode in the high-stake battle between estranged partners Amazon and Future Group. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/amazon-future-coupons/">bought 49% in one of Future’s unlisted firms</a> last year in a deal that was valued at over $100 million. As part of that deal, Future could not have sold assets to rivals, Amazon said in court filings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Things changed this year after the coronavirus pandemic starved the Indian firm of cash, Future Group chief executive and founder Kishore Biyani said at a recent virtual conference. In August, Future Group said that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">reached an agreement with Ambani’s Reliance Industries</a>, which runs India’s largest retail chain, to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics, and warehousing businesses for $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Months later, Amazon protested the deal by reaching an arbitrator in Singapore and asked the court to block the deal between the Indian retail giants. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/reliance-says-its-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-fully-enforceable-under-indian-law-despite-amazon-winning-an-arbitration-order/">secured emergency relief from the arbitration court</a> in Singapore in late October that temporarily halted Future Group from going ahead with the sale.</p>
<p>Until Monday, it remained unclear whether that ruling would hold any water in front of Indian courts. So much so that hours after the Singapore arbitration court announced its verdict, Future Group and Reliance said in a statement that will be going ahead with the deal &#8220;without any delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon had also reached out to the Competition Commission of India, the Indian watchdog, to block the deal. Competition Commission of India, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/india-approves-reliances-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-brings-a-new-headache-to-amazon/">approved the deal</a> between the Indian firms. In earlier hearings, lawyers for Future Group likened Amazon’s effort to block Future Group’s deal to the East India Company, the British trading house whose arrival in India kicked off nearly 200 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s retail market that is estimated to balloon to $1.3 trillion by 2025, up from $700 billion last year, according to consultancy firm BCG and local trade group Retailers’ Association India. Online shopping accounts for about 3% of all retail in India.</p>
<p>Future Group and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More details to follow&#8230;</em></p>

<p>The conglomerate first revealed its SPAC plans in October when SoftBank Investment Advisers chief executive officer Rajeev Misra<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/12/softbank-vision-fund-head-rajeev-misra-vision-fund-2-is-backing-spac.html"> said he was planning a SPAC</a> while speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference. An SPAC would give the Vision Fund another way of investing in private companies, and also allow the public to invest in SoftBank’s portfolio picks.</p>
<p>SPACs are blank-check companies created for the purpose of merging or acquiring other companies, and have gained popularity this year as an alternative to traditional stock market debuts.</p>
<p>While this would be SoftBank’s first SPAC, one of its portfolio companies, real-estate platform OpenDoor, recently went public through an SPAC. Another one of its investments, Indonesian e-commerce giant Tokopedia, is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/47ac0aa7-220c-4f8e-baac-4f44cfb09156">also considering going public through a SPAC</a> backed by Richard Li and Peter Thiel, after putting its IPO plans because of the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Payam Banazadeh and his team started <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/">Capella Space</a> in 2016, they had visions of providing private industry with a wealth of new data that they could use in all sorts of ways to create business opportunities and improve efficiencies.</p>
<p>Four years later, Banazadeh is still waiting for that commercial opportunity.</p>
<p>Capella is still successful. The company has managed to raise $82 million in venture capital financing and has a robust pipeline of government contracts, but Banazadeh has not seen the kinds of uptake in private industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He&#8217;s not the only one.</p>
<p>Speaking at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a>, Banazadeh was among a number of executives including Peter Platzer, the chief executive officer of <a href="https://spire.com/">Spire Global</a>; Helsinki-based <a href="https://www.iceye.com/">ICEYE&#8217;</a>s co-founder and chief executive Rafal Modrzewski; and Melanie Stricklan, the founder and chief strategy officer of Slingshot Aerospace; who spoke about the central role government plays in the current space business and how they&#8217;re hoping that will change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think regulation in the US&#8230; has made huge improvements this past year. But the challenge is always how do you balance national security concerns with making sure that the US industrial space can keep up with the competition internationally,&#8221; Banazadeh said. &#8220;I think we need to&#8230; in the US&#8230; we need to take a leadership position to not just restrict the US companies on following what international companies are doing, but rather allow US companies to go above and beyond and be able to capture more of the commercial market by being able to provide some of the more advanced features [that they have] on the government side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Modrzewski agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we were starting <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/iceye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="iceye">ICEYE, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> we were kind of all under the impression that the idea behind new space and things that we are doing, is really to enable the use of observation for the betterment of the world&#8230; For improving efficiencies of businesses, monitoring climate change, doing all these things that that that we haven&#8217;t been able to do to do before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And when I look at basically democratizing data and handing best capabilities available to commercial industries, as well as to the government, ultimately, right, because they are users of the same, the same supply chain. I see that you know, the largest factor that&#8217;s currently stopping the evolution is actually national approach to particular sets of activities. I think the the more globally we approach to the market, the broader the competition, the less limitation we impact&#8230; It seems to work significantly better for everyone as a global community, if we allow those companies to freely collaborate, and the data exchange to be free. So if there was one wish that I had for 2021, it is to have less borders, and more open markets in terms of exchange of data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Governments are, already, massive customers for most of these businesses. In total government spending represents around half of the total $423 billion spent on the space industry already,<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/5049/space-exploration/"> according to data from Statista</a>.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space#:~:text=The%20Global%20Space%20Economy&amp;text=Morgan%20Stanley%20estimates%20that%20the,from%20satellite%20broadband%20Internet%20access.">if the industry is to achieve the $1 trillion potential revenue that Morgan Stanley projects for businesses in the next 20 years</a>, then more will have to be done to unlock private industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started the company, we saw the immediate opportunity in commercial. And as we dug a little deeper and made some progress, we realized that the commercial market is still not as mature as we had hoped it to be. And in the meantime, we quickly found out that the government market, both US government, as well as international governments are expanding and growing much faster than, than before, specifically for this type of data, because of the new challenges and challenges and threats that are that are around the corner,&#8221; Banazadeh said. &#8220;And so we&#8217;ve pivoted and focused on going after governments in catering to their needs&#8230; We do want to get back into commercial, we have that aspiration. And that&#8217;s our long term goal. We just think that we&#8217;re probably a few years out to get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the commercial market may not have materialized to the degree that these entrepreneurs would have hoped, there are still opportunities for plenty of business from government contracts thanks, in part, to the increasing complexity of operating in space.</p>
<p>That means big business for company&#8217;s like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slingshot-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slingshot-3">Slingshot, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which provides what Stricklan calls &#8220;situational awareness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether that&#8217;s in orbit or terrestrially, we provide answers to our customers around their risk and and how to mitigate that risk, or at least how to understand the risk as it pertains to spatial-temporal information,&#8221; Stricklan said. &#8220;And so right now &#8230; their most important asset is their data [and] in order to get that data, they have to have their satellites in orbit, and they have to have safety of flight and all those different things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exploding number of satellites in orbit and the presence of nearly 500,000 pieces of space debris means that operationally these very expensive assets are at greater risk than they were. Slingshot tries to solve that problem by giving its customers orbital awareness of potential risks, and providing ways to process data to understand the terrestrial risks that companies face.</p>
<p>Everyone from insurance companies to logistics providers to financial investors use satellite data and imagery in their decision making process and an increasing driver for all of these businesses is a chance to model out impacts from climate change, according to Platzer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I think the demand for a global understanding off the planet, to use its resources in an effective and responsible way, is unabated&#8230; For Spire in particular, you know, the impact of climate change through weather on every single business in every single country, for every single person is certainly not going away. And so that demand is is absolutely increasing,&#8221; Platzer said. &#8220;So I honestly actually see mostly, almost exclusively opportunities, and not necessarily obstacles, funding in the industry is growing at 46%. year over year. Company creation is growing at 32% year over year. So I think I think it&#8217;s really a very, very dynamic period, which is more dominated by opportunities than obstacles I would say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Increasingly, startups will be able to meet these opportunities, especially if they can receive a boost from government entities that can highlight the areas that are emerging business opportunities and leave it to private industry to pursue them, Modrzewski said.</p>
<p>Still, the panelists agreed that there&#8217;s no better time to start a company focused on the space industry than now.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;If I could encourage those that have any sort of inspiration to start a company around space to do it, just do it. Execute on that, that vision, but understand all of the things that we talked about today are different than the risk of say, starting a marketing company. So be up to the challenge to understand the government as part of this and understand rules and regulations, and outside of the government that impact how we fly satellites, how we take care of satellites, how we provide data and understand that there&#8217;s a lot of legacy that comes with this industry,&#8221; Stricklan said. &#8220;I think the global space ecosystem is one that remains heavily siloed. It&#8217;s not like the digital transformations that have happened in Silicon Valley. Over the last 10 or 15 years. This industry still needs that digital transformation and so the the world is your oyster, but be prepared and be up for the challenge.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Citizen Lab researchers say they have found evidence that dozens of journalists had their iPhones silently compromised with spyware known to be used by nation states.</p>
<p>For more than the past year, London-based reporter Rania Dridi and at least 36 journalists, producers and executives working for the Al Jazeera news agency were targeted with a so-called &#8220;zero-click&#8221; attack that exploited a now-fixed vulnerability in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> iMessage. The attack invisibly compromised the devices without having to trick the victims into opening a malicious link.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab, the internet watchdog at the University of Toronto, was asked to investigate earlier this year after one of the victims, Al Jazeera investigative journalist Tamer Almisshal, suspected that his phone may have been hacked.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/">a technical report</a> out Sunday and shared with TechCrunch, the researchers say they believe the journalists&#8217; iPhones were infected with the Pegasus spyware, developed by Israel-based NSO Group.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed Almisshal&#8217;s iPhone and found it had between July and August connected to servers known to be used by NSO for delivering the Pegasus spyware. The device revealed a burst of network activity that suggests that the spyware may have been delivered silently over iMessage.</p>
<p>Logs from the phone show that the spyware was likely able to secretly record the microphone and phone calls, take photos using the phone&#8217;s camera, access the victim&#8217;s passwords, and track the phone&#8217;s location.</p>

<p>Citizen Lab said the bulk of the hacks were likely carried out by at least four NSO customers, including the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, citing evidence it found in similar attacks involving Pegasus.</p>
<p>The researchers found evidence that two other NSO customers hacked into one and three Al Jazeera phones respectively, but that they could not attribute the attacks to a specific government.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Al Jazeera, which just broadcast its reporting of the hacks, did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>NSO sells governments and nation states access to its Pegasus spyware <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyznnq/how-nso-group-helps-countries-hack-targets">as a prepackaged service</a> by providing the infrastructure and the exploits needed to launch the spyware against the customer&#8217;s targets. But the spyware maker has repeatedly distanced itself from what its customers do and has said it does not who its customers target. Some of NSO&#8217;s known customers include authoritarian regimes. Saudi Arabia allegedly used the surveillance technology to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/middleeast/saudi-khashoggi-spyware-israel.html">spy on the communications of columnist Jamal Khashoggi</a> shortly before his murder, which U.S. intelligence concluded was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">likely ordered</a> by the kingdom&#8217;s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said it also found evidence that Dridi, a journalist at Arabic television station Al Araby in London, had fallen victim to a zero-click attack. The researchers said Dridi was likely targeted by the UAE government.</p>
<p>In a phone call, Dridi told TechCrunch that her phone may have been targeted because of her close association to a person of interest to the UAE.</p>
<p>Dridi&#8217;s phone, an iPhone XS Max, was targeted for a longer period, likely between October 2019 and July 2020. The researchers found evidence that she was targeted on two separate occasions with a zero-day attack — the name of an exploit that has not been previously disclosed and that a patch is not yet available — because her phone was running the latest version of iOS both times.</p>
<p>&#8220;My life is not normal anymore. I don&#8217;t feel like I have a private life again,&#8221; said Dridi. &#8220;To be a journalist is not a crime,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said its latest findings reveal an &#8220;accelerating trend of espionage&#8221; against journalists and news organizations, and that the growing use of zero-click exploits makes it increasingly difficult — though evidently not impossible — to detect because of the more sophisticated techniques used to infect victims&#8217; devices while covering their tracks.</p>
<p>When reached on Saturday, NSO said it was unable to comment on the allegations as it had not seen the report, but declined to say when asked if Saudi Arabia or the UAE were customers or describe what processes — if any — it puts in place to prevent customers from targeting journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first we are hearing of these assertions. As we have repeatedly stated, we do not have access to any information related to the identities of individuals upon whom our system is alleged to have been used to conduct surveillance. However, when we receive credible evidence of misuse, combined with the basic identifiers of the alleged targets and timeframes, we take all necessary steps in accordance with our product misuse investigation procedure to review the allegations,&#8221; said a spokesperson.</p>
<p>“We are unable to comment on a report we have not yet seen. We do know that CitizenLab regularly publishes reports based on inaccurate assumptions and without a full command of the facts, and this report will likely follow that theme NSO provides products that enable governmental law enforcement agencies to tackle serious organized crime and counterterrorism only, but as stated in the past, we do not operate them. Nevertheless, we are committed to ensuring our policies are adhered to, and any evidence of a breach will be taken seriously and investigated.”</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said it stood by its findings.</p>

<p>Spokespeople for the Saudi and UAE governments in New York did not respond to an email requesting comment.</p>
<p>The attacks not only puts a renewed focus on the shadowy world of surveillance spyware, but also the companies having to defend against it. Apple rests much of its public image on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-takes-aim-at-adtech-hysteria-over-ios-app-tracking-change/">advocating privacy</a> for its users and building secure devices, like iPhones, designed to be hardened against the bulk of attacks. But no technology is impervious to security bugs. In 2016, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-karma/">Reuters reported</a> that UAE-based cybersecurity firm DarkMatter bought a zero-click exploit to target iMessage, which they referred to as &#8220;Karma.&#8221; The exploit worked even if the user did not actively use the messaging app.</p>
<p>Apple told TechCrunch that it had not independently verified Citizen Lab&#8217;s findings but that the vulnerabilities used to target the reporters were fixed in iOS 14, released in September.</p>
<p>“At Apple, our teams work tirelessly to strengthen the security of our users’ data and devices. iOS 14 is a major leap forward in security and delivered new protections against these kinds of attacks. The attack described in the research was highly targeted by nation-states against specific individuals. We always urge customers to download the latest version of the software to protect themselves and their data,&#8221; said an Apple spokesperson.</p>
<p>NSO is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/whatsapp-spyware-nso-group/">embroiled in a legal battle with Facebook</a>, which last year blamed the Israeli spyware maker for using a similar, previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones/">undisclosed zero-click exploit</a> in WhatsApp to infect some 1,400 devices with the Pegasus spyware.</p>
<p>Facebook discovered and patched the vulnerability, stopping the attack in its tracks, but said that more than 100 human rights defenders, journalists and &#8220;other members of civil society&#8221; had fallen victim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s be clear: &#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/songbird" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="songbird">Songbird&#8221; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is not a good movie.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to see how it could have been any good, since <a href="https://ew.com/movies/songbird-first-look-k-j-apa/">&#8220;Songbird&#8221; was written shortly after the pandemic began and filmed a few months later</a> — so the filmmakers had to write a screenplay, shoot it in the midst of a pandemic and edit it, all in under a year.</p>
<p>So it feels remarkable that they managed to succeed in at least making an entertaining — if very silly — B-movie. The story is set in the near future, when the lockdown has extended for years and the virus has mutated into COVID-23. Managing the pandemic has fallen to the Department of Sanitation, which can quickly identifies anyone infected and drags them away to unseen Q-Zones.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might be wondering whether you want to watch a movie that hits so close to the real-life nightmare that we&#8217;re currently living through. The good news is that there&#8217;s nothing particularly believable in &#8220;Songbird,&#8221; and a more than a few things that are outright laughable.</p>
<p>But as we explain in the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, Anthony and Darrell both enjoyed the film (currently available to rent on-demand), perhaps because they went in expecting a complete disaster, so they were pleasantly surprised to discover an goofy, unpretentious thriller with one or two genuinely chilling scenes. Jordan, on the other hand, had high hopes, which may explain why she hated it.</p>

<p>Welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mixtape-podcast/">Mixtape</a>, the TechCrunch podcast that looks at the human element that powers technology.</p>
<p>For this episode we spoke with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/meredith-whittaker" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="meredith-whittaker">Meredith Whittaker, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder of the <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/">AI Now Institute</a> and Minderoo Research Professor at NYU; Mara Mills, associate professor of Media, Culture and Communication at NYU and co-director of the <a href="https://disabilitystudies.nyu.edu/">NYU Center for Disability Studies</a>; and Sara Hendren, professor at Olin College of Engineering and author of the recently published <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/561049/what-can-a-body-do-by-sara-hendren/">What Can a Body Do: How We Meet the Built World</a>.<br />
It was a wide-ranging discussion about artificial intelligence and disability. Hendren kicked us off by exploring the distinction between the medical and social models of disability:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>So in a medical model of disability, as articulated in disability studies, the idea is just that disability is a kind of condition or an impairment or something that&#8217;s going on with your body that takes it out of the normative average state of the body says something in your sensory makeup or mobility or whatever is impaired, and therefore, the disability kind of lives on the body itself. But in a social model of disability, it&#8217;s just an invitation to widen the aperture a little bit and include, not just the body itself and what it what it does or doesn&#8217;t do biologically. But also the interaction between that body and the normative shapes of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to technology, Mills says, some companies work squarely in the realm of the medical model with the goal being a total cure rather than just accommodation, while other companies or technologies – and even inventors – will work more in the social model with the goal of transforming the world and create an accommodation. But despite this, she says, they still tend to have “fundamentally normative or mainstream ideas of function and participation rather than disability forward ideas.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“The question with AI, and also just with old mechanical things like Brailers I would say, would be are we aiming to perceive the world in different ways, in blind ways, in minoritarian ways? Or is the goal of the technology, even if it&#8217;s about making a social, infrastructural change still about something standard or normative or seemingly typical? And that&#8217;s &#8212; there are very few technologies, probably for financial reasons, that are really going for the disability forward design.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As Whittaker notes, AI by its nature is fundamentally normative.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It draws conclusions from large sets of data, and that&#8217;s the world it sees, right? And it looks at what&#8217;s most average in this data and what&#8217;s an outlier. So it&#8217;s something that is consistently replicating these norms, right? If it&#8217;s trained on the data, and then it gets an impression from the world that doesn&#8217;t match the data it&#8217;s already seen, that impression is going to be an outlier. It won&#8217;t recognize that it won&#8217;t know how to treat that. Right. And there are a lot of complexities here. But I think, I think that&#8217;s something we have to keep in mind as sort of a nucleus of this technology, when we talk about its potential applications in and out of these sorts of capitalist incentives, like what is it capable of doing? What does it do? What does it act like? And can we think about it, you know, ever possibly in company encompassing the multifarious, you know, huge amounts of ways that disability manifests or doesn&#8217;t manifest.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Twitter is shutting down Periscope, the video app it acquired several years ago when Facebook Live threatened to lap the field. When we stream the Gillmor Gang sessions, we send them to Facebook, Twitter, and an unlisted embed on YouTube. At one point, we planned to stream the sessions live on TechCrunch, but for now we’re posting the edited version there.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to January 20th, the live Telegram feed at https://t.me/Gillmorgang has been dominated by the Trump focus on overturning the election results. Each failed attempt to alter the outcome dilutes Trump’s leverage as his Republican allies struggle with his threats and Twitter rage. In just a few weeks of this, the mechanics of vaccine distribution has overwhelmed the political story as people start calculating the number of days to getting access to the medicine. What Trump does in 2024? Who cares.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pardons are also losing traction as White House staff jockey for access to the vaccine. With a couple of weeks to the New Year and then a sprint to Biden’s installation, the cable networks are retooling for ratings fodder in the new normal. Tech companies are rejiggering their real estate and tax implications of where the home office is located in a Work from Anywhere environment.</p>
<p>Handicapping the Georgia special elections will fill most of the cable news schedule until January 6th, but no matter what happens in the Senate, the real action shifts to corporate and economic imperatives to control the pandemic through behavior around masks, distancing, real testing, and contact tracing to isolate the pockets of virus resistance to herd immunity. While government mandates are difficult to install at a national level, corporate requirements are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Week two of the streaming realignment features some talent lashback from big movie directors. It’s reminiscent of last year’s brief Spielberg attack on Netflix and Oscar politics. This year it’s the Oscars that are losing credibility. It’s still a ways to go before the Best Picture category is all streaming but the audience out there is in no hurry to see Dune on the big screen. As with the election, facts are a trailing indicator. The move to streaming is not if but when.</p>
<p>Less certain is when I upgrade to the next iPhone. Part of the problem is the competition for mindshare with the M1 MacBooks. Instead of one device I don’t need there are two. It’s clearly a one percent mental crisis on the surface, but beneath lurks a serious debate on what we do as the twin viruses recede. The phone is the new MTV, the Star Trek communicator, and the Get SmartShoe rolled into one. The laptop is a different story, a bold harmonizing of the suite of services across the desktop and mobile platforms.</p>
<p>The new phone offers iterative advances — a better camera, 5G support, a bigger battery. M1 jumpstarts a software surge across all Apple devices, pushing professional video editing and post-production tools to a prosumer customer base that seriously threatens Windows and Intel as the dominant platform for a post pandemic economy. Those still amortizing the last generation of the MacBook Pro 16 will hold out, but resistance will fade. The move to Apple Silicon is not if but when.</p>
<p>Still I don’t have a rationale for buying one. I’ll just have to do it anyway.</p>
<p>By the way, I’ll pretend to fund the M1 by cutting back on my newsletter subscriptions. Smart writers like the Ben’s Stratechery and Evans are caught behind the paywall of their shiny new newsletters, which trade reach for revenue. Then the very special long form pieces they used to justify the subscription cost start showing up a few weeks later in the clear. It’s the newsletter version of the Hollywood windowing system that Jason Kilar and WarnerMedia are blowing up with HBO Max.</p>
<p>This piece by Ben Thompson is a hybrid of the form. It’s got plenty of quotes from his Daily pay newsletter mixed with a less methodical but more supple set of semi-ideas that actually make me want to subscribe. Like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the flipside, to the extent that v2 social networking allows people to be themselves in all the different ways they wish to be, the more likely it is they become close to people who see other parts of the world in ways that differ from their own. Critically, though, unlike Facebook or Twitter, that exposure happens in an environment of trust that encourages understanding, not posturing.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is M1 fodder, I’ll call it. Lost in the social network lockdown miasma but somehow potentially transcendent of the big fish in a small pond quandary where the newsletter eco system derails. 10 bucks a month times 3 or 4 adds up to real money I won’t be funneling to Cupertino, or Disney + or Whatever + for that matter. But a bundle of cooperating newsletters that promote a certain type of work that aggregates useful data about a strategic influential audience — you betcha.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange,<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/chris-dean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="person" data-entity="chris-dean"> a </a>weekly startups-and-markets newsletter.

<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<h2><del>Sweet dreams are made of IPOs, so merry f****** Christmas</del></h2>
<h2><del>We’re all very tired but there’s still so much news to go over I am sorry</del></h2>
<h2>Can you IPO sneakers? Also, this is the last Exchange roundup of the year</h2>
<p id="speakable-summary">Hello everyone, hope you are well. This is the final Exchange newsletter of 2020. There will be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">handful of columns</a> next week before I take some time off. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a> will publish episodes throughout the termination of this accursed annum, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And now that we’re done with housekeeping, our two focuses of the week: Who is going public and how fast a particular cohort of startups are growing.</p>
<p>Sure, the two topics aren’t incredibly related issues, but I am not going to let unending IPO news ruin what I wanted to talk about. So, SEC broccoli first, and then we get to have some fun.</p>
<h3>IPOh-no-they-didn’t</h3>
<p>IPO news was busy this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">with Coinbase</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/uipath-files-confidential-ipo-paperwork-with-sec/">and UIPath filing privately</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/unpacking-poshmarks-ipo-filing/">Poshmark filing publicly</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/bumble-reportedly-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/">Bumble reportedly filing privately</a>. In short, we’ve added four names to our IPO roll-call, that already included Affirm and Roblox, which have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/ipo-delays-are-bumming-me-out/">delayed their own offerings</a>.</p>
<p>And with names like Chime, Robinhood, Expensify, and others already of sufficient scale to go public at-will, the brand-name IPO crop of 2021 could rival what we saw this year.</p>
<p>Thanks to unicorns looking to graze public pastures, and public markets near all-time-highs, it appears that we’re going to see it rain liquidity over the coming months. This means that aggregate venture capital <a href="http://www.allenlatta.com/allens-blog/lp-corner-fund-performance-metrics-multiples-tvpi-dpi-and-rvpi">DPI and TVPI metrics</a> will scoot higher, making the entire asset class even more attractive than it was in today’s yield-hungry world.</p>
<p>The music continues.</p>
<h3>Just how big is the software business?</h3>
<p>Earlier this week, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">covered Ramp’s new round</a>. <a href="https://t.co/robCWKydUu?amp=1">Ramp</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/">launched in February</a>, and was dismissed by some as a Brex clone at the time. Ramp and <a href="http://brex.com">Brex</a> compete with <a href="http://getdivvy.com">Divvy</a> and other startups (more on two others in a moment) to help other companies manage their spend through a combination of real and virtual cards, and software.</p>
<p>Along with some new software features, Ramp announced growth metrics as part of its news bundle. When reached to Divvy for similar numbers, the company supplied them. Brex declined to share results, which was fine. And I failed to mention a few competing companies, namely <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a> and <a href="https://www.plateiq.com/">Plate IQ</a>.</p>
<p>Airbase I should have included as I covered it in March, 2020 when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/spend-control-focused-airbase-adds-23-5m-to-its-series-a-as-it-posts-quick-growth/">raised $23.5 million in a Series A-extension</a> (the new capital came in at a trebled-valuation, so you could call it a Series B, frankly). Regardless, Airbase matters not only because it is a competitor to Ramp and Divvy and Brex, but because while it offers similar products to its rivals, it also <em>charges</em> for its software.</p>
<p>This is in contrast, as far as I can tell, with Divvy and Brex and Ramp, companies more focused on signing up great masses of companies and driving revenues from interchange incomes. (Not charging for software that is wrapped around commodity cards is a way to keep sales-friction low, and thus, in theory, customer-growth high.)</p>
<p>But while Airbase wants corporate customers to pay for its software, it’s still growing like all heck. According to an email from Airbase CEO Thejo Kote, the startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) has grown by 2.5x this year, and payment volume has “grown 7X on an annualized basis.”</p>
<p>Those are super-good numbers. Adding another company to the success mix, well-known investor <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1339809530067079168">Garry Tan said on Twitter</a> that Plate IQ, a company I have yet to meet, is “doing more than $500M in annual transactions and is profitable (real earnings).” For contrast, the relatively young Ramp just announced that it had cleared $100 million in aggregate managed spend.</p>
<p>My takeaway from this spate of reporting is not that any single company is going to win, or that one company is the clear leader. Instead this week’s poking around a single software niche reminded me of just how big the software market is.</p>
<p>How is there room for all of these competing startups to grow so quickly at the same time? The answer is that the global economy is huge, and software is still merrily grinding its way into more and more of its heft. I bet we wind up with three of our five companies in this piece surviving to public-scale, and just two being snapped up by private rivals or public giants.</p>
<p>I suppose this makes me long cloud. Whatever. Just don’t tell VC Twitter.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>This week to make things easy, I’ve broken up the rest of the things you need to know into two groups. The first is everything that was not a round. The second is all the rounds. Let’s go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slack’s venture capital fund is <a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/slack-fund-anniversary-investing">back for more</a>, the parent company is self-funding the project, and the capital pool has doubled in size to $50 million.</li>
<li>StockX has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/the-stockx-megaround-smells-like-pre-ipo-money/">reached IPO scale</a>. TechCrunch covered its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/stockx-raises-275m-series-e-valuing-the-retailer-at-2-8b/">fundraising news this week</a>, writing at the time that the marketplace for used clothing goods was an IPO candidate. So we took a look. Yep. It’s an IPO candidate.</li>
<li>The Information reported this week that <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sofi-q3-revenue-hit-200-million-aided-by-low-rates?shared=1c0960c0d0a48bd3">SoFi did around $200 million in revenue during Q3</a>, and was EBITDA-positive.</li>
<li>Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/creators-income-revenue-snapchat-cameo-substack-66457b1b-a9ab-4065-b0c6-58baa81edec4.html">reported on the growth of the creator economy</a>. Stop rolling your eyes. It’s more than big enough to take seriously, so get on board. We also chatted about the situation on Equity, if you are into podcasts with jokes.</li>
<li>Crypto is back in the headlines, and recent price gains amongst the asset category are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/">not based on pure hype</a>.</li>
<li>Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">had a tough week</a>. The company’s shot at an IPO if it wants one probably won’t come under siege &#8212; it wouldn’t be the only company to go public in recent quarters with some legal matters underway &#8212; but it was still not the week that the stock trading company wanted. And its rival Public.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">raised precisely as much money</a> as Robinhood had to pay in fines. Ouch.</li>
<li>Startup valuations are, in Silicon Valley at least, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/startup-valuations-have-essentially-finished-their-recovery-from-summer-lows/">on the other-side of the COVID-depression</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, a stampede of megarounds.</p>
<h2>Huge and Important</h2>
<p>Our Various &amp; Sundry section this week is anything but. So I renamed it for this final newsletter of the year. Here they are, the rounds both huge and important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/brazilian-lending-company-creditas-raises-255-million-as-latin-americas-fintech-explosion-continues/">Brazil’s Creditas raised $255 million</a>. TechCrunch placed the round amongst a larger wave of Latin America-focused fintech rounds.</li>
<li>Zenoti, based in Bellevue near Microsoft, raised $160 million, a round that made it a unicorn. What does it do? Per <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/bellevue-software-maker-zenoti-raises-160-million-as-its-valuation-tops-1-billion/">The Seattle Times</a>, it “makes cloud-computing software for managing spas and salons.” Don’t laugh. Vertical SaaS is huge. Barbershop focused vertical SaaS player Squire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/squire-series-c/">was valued at $250 million the other week</a>.</li>
<li>Adding another payments-focused round to the newsletter, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/17/fintech-gocardless-nears-1-billion-valuation-after-new-funding-round.html">GoCardless is nearly a unicorn</a> after raising more money this week.</li>
<li>And sticking to fintech, France’s Lydia, which “aims to be an all-in-one, in-hand platform for any financial needs” of younger consumers, <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/lydia-series-b/">according to Tech.EU</a>, extended its Series B by $86 million this week. (Accel led that round, and Public’s latest as well. Big week for that firm.)</li>
<li>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/clickup-hits-1-billion-valuation-in-100m-series-b-raise/">reported that ClickUp</a> has put together a new $100 million round that values the company at $1 billion. It raised $35 million in June. Why do we care about ClickUp? It’s part of a wave of companies that closed two rounds in 2020. Ramp. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">Welcome</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">SkyFlow</a>. The list goes on.</li>
<li>In the Insurtech world, <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/12/16/bestow-raises-70-million-to-grow-digital-life-insurance-platform/">Bestow raised $70 million</a> for its digital life insurance product. Insurtech has been hot lately, with <a href="https://agentsync.io/">AgentSync</a>, a player in the space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">raising two rounds this year alone</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, Paxos, which does crypto work for PayPal among other things, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2020/12/17/paypals-cryptocurrency-partner-paxos-raises-142-million">raised $142 million in a mammoth Series C</a>. Chalk this one up to the crypto boom.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now I shall disappear in a cloud of JUUL mist to lose some more games of Civ 6 to <a href="https://twitter.com/AashViswanathan">my nemesis</a>, Hugs and and all the best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was quite the week for Pinterest and not in a good way. While the company settled the gender discrimination lawsuit brought forth by its former COO, the hefty $22.5 million settlement highlighted some of the tech industry’s inequities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Airbnb outlined some new goals around diversity and inclusion, despite having not produced a diversity report since last year, when it disclosed its 2018 data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that and more in this week’s edition of Human Capital. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here</a> to get this newsletter in your inbox every Friday at 1 p.m. PT.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>Pinterest settles gender discrimination lawsuit for $22.5 million</b></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/pinterest-settles-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-with-former-coo-for-22-5-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it had settled the gender discrimination lawsuit brought forth by former COO Francoise Brougher. In August, Brougher sued Pinterest, alleging gender discrimination, retaliation and wrongful termination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the settlement, Pinterest will pay $20 million to Brougher and her attorneys, and both Pinterest and Brougher will commit $2.5 million toward “Advancing women and underrepresented communities” in the tech industry, the company wrote in a filing.</span></p>
<p><b>On Black women laying “the groundwork for someone else to swoop in and collect ‘progress’”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Brougher filed suit against Pinterest, former Pinterest employees Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks publicly alleged racial and gender discrimination while working at the company. I spoke with Ozoma and Banks about the settlement and how it compared to their outcomes. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a call with TechCrunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this week, Ozoma and Banks described a double standard in their experiences compared to Brougher’s. While Brougher received a $20 million payout, Ozoma and Banks received less than one year’s worth of severance. Here are some pertinent words they shared on the settlement:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Banks</strong>: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This follows the time-honored tradition in America where Black women come forward, blazing a trail, revealing injustice and white women coming in and reaping all the benefits of that.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ozoma:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we, like in many, many, many other cases, Black women put ourselves on the line, shared absolutely everything that happened to us, then laid the groundwork for someone else to swoop in and collect ‘progress. No progress has been made here because no rights have been made with people who harm has been done to.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>Pinterest agrees to adopt DEI recommendations</b></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinterest-says-it-will-adopt-workplace-culture-recommendations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest committed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to adopting the recommendations from its special committee of the board of directors. The committee formed earlier this year in June, shortly after two former employees, Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks, went public with their allegations of racial and gender discrimination while working at Pinterest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of those recommendations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mandatory unconscious bias training for every employee, including managers and executives</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer additional trainings on inclusivity and unconscious bias</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">include “diverse employees” in interview panels with job candidates</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reward employees for their efforts to support and promote DEI</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publish a diversity report twice a year for at least two years; after two years, publish the report annually</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">establish criteria for promotion eligibility</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enhance Pinterest’s harassment and discrimination policy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a centralized workplace investigations team to ensure consistent and fair outcomes</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Gig workers are ready for battle as we enter the new year</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over on Extra Crunch, I did a deep dive into what’s next for gig workers and companies in light of the passage of Prop 22. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gist is that Prop 22 does not mark the end of the battle of the status of gig workers. Companies are looking to pursue similar legislation in other places while gig workers are gearing up for another battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, it’s hard to predict where companies like Uber and Lyft will go next, Brian Chen of the National Employment Law Project said, but it’s likely they’ll want to go to big markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Places where they know there’s been on-the-ground workers organizing and activists they’d finally like to stomp out, and where enforcement has been strong against the company,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen pointed to New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Washington, Oregon and Michigan. Wherever these companies bring the battle next, Chen says NELP will be heavily involved in fighting back. As will workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We already know companies are doing this proactively, so we need to be doing this proactively as well,” Bain told me. “I think there is a lot we are going to be up against. It depends on some of the people who are appointed in labor positions and what their actual principles and values are, but I’m a little more optimistic. Things that were not possible to do under Trump will just be really difficult to do under Biden, but not impossible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full, 2,318-word story here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Gig Workers Rising to launch app to help workers understand their rights under Prop 22</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gig Workers Rising is gearing up to </span><a href="https://gigworkersrising.org/workers-first/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release an app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help gig workers understand their new rights and benefits under Prop 22. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[&#8230;] workers know that gig companies have a history of making and breaking promises to workers,” the site states. “These corporations depend on you not knowing your rights and being unable to advocate for the benefits you are owed.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lyft.com/hub/posts/prop-22-passes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lyft outlined the benefits that are now available to drivers. </span></p>
<p><b>Airbnb sets new DEI goals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb, which recently went public and became a $100 billion company, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/airbnb-sets-new-diversity-goals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently set two goals </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to try to improve diversity at the home-sharing and experiences company because it “is nowhere near satisfied with the status quo,” the company wrote in a blog post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of 2025, Airbnb is aiming for 20% of its U.S. workforce to be underrepresented minorities, which includes folks who self-identify as American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Currently, underrepresented minorities make up just 12% of the company’s employee base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second goal is to increase the representation of women to 50% by the end of 2025. </span></p>
<p><b>Intel’s diversity report breaks out underrepresented women data for first time</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some highlights from </span><a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/we-must-collaborate-not-compete-diversity/#gs.o6gs5s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representation of Hispanic employees increased from 10% to 10.5% year over year</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representation of underrepresented minorities in the exec level decreased to 8.4% from 8.8%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underrepresented women in exec roles increased from 1.8% to 2.4%</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>TechCrunch Sessions: Justice 2021 tickets on sale</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, tickets are now available for TC Sessions: Justice 2021. Don’t worry, it’ll be an entirely virtual event and tickets are just $5 a pop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is taking place from your living room on March 3, 2021. Already, we’ve lined up speakers like Backstage Capital founder and Managing Partner Arlan Hamilton, Kickstarter Union co-organizer Clarissa Redwine and Ethel’s Club/Somewhere Good founder and CEO Naj Austin. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I often begin calls with founders by asking why they’re willing to bet their livelihoods on an idea that will most likely fail. It’s a small hack that lets me see how vulnerable a founder is, and how much conviction they have behind their ideas. Sometimes, if they answer, it’s the lede of my story. And sometimes, if they don’t answer, it’s the reason I don’t write the story.</p>
<p>As blunt as the question sounds, it can spark the best answers &#8212; especially when the founder is working on an idea that is a moonshot in and of itself.</p>
<p>Speaking of wild bets, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">Kirsten Korosec</a> caught up with Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson about his electric robotaxi, a six-year effort that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-zoox-unveils-electric-robotaxi-that-can-travel-up-to-75-mph/">was unveiled this week</a>, outpacing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/ ">competitors.</a> Levinson was heads down on an idea that wasn’t just likely to fail, it almost did: Zoox’s Series C fell apart in March due to the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p><em>Korosec: What was your trick or how did you remain focused for six years on something that is futuristic, expensive and possibly could fail? What did you personally do to keep that focus?</em></p>
<p><em>Levinson: Well, doing something like this is definitely challenging and it requires patience. I think the advice I would give is first to convince yourself that what you’re doing makes sense and is important and worth doing. If you’re starting a company because your goal is to make as much money as possible, if it turns out to be hard it’s going to be really difficult to convince yourself and your team and investors to stick with the idea.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the great things about Zoox is that the idea itself just makes a lot of sense. From first principles, there’s really a compelling reason to solve the problem the way we’ve been solving it and the market opportunity is unquestionably enormous. So armed with those facts and a team of wonderful employees and investors who strongly believed in that, we were able to weather some of the ups and downs of the industry, even though it’s not always been an easy ride.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It didn’t hurt that Amazon saved Zoox after its failed Series C, considering deep pockets and futuristic technology go well together. Still, Zoox’s ability to turn failure into focus is impressive, and part of what makes startups successful.</p>

<h2>The Palantir ‘Diaspora’</h2>
<p>Everyone wants to invest in the next big tech mafia. This year, given the number of successful IPOs on the market, newly minted and cash-rich thinkers are entering the startup landscape from legendary companies, including Snowflake, Airbnb and Palantir. Stripe engineers, even pre-IPO, seem to be the hottest commodity out there.</p>
<p>So, investors are hoping to bet on exiting talent &#8211; and one has had the upper edge for a while now. Ross Fubin of XYZ Ventures introduced Palantir’s first business hire to its first engineer, which he describes as “the highest-value thing” he’s ever done. Now, after helping Palantir scale up its senior talent (and pocketing some advisor shares for himself) he invests in the Palantir diaspora out of his fund.</p>
<p>Connie Loizos, TechCrunch’s Silicon Valley editor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/this-vc-introduced-palantirs-first-business-hire-to-its-earliest-engineer-then-his-business-took-off/">has the story</a>, including where XYZ is looking for startups outside of the once-secretive public company’s staff.</p>
<p>Loizos also profiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/lux-capitals-deena-shakir-sees-space-and-frontier-tech-going-mainstream-right-now/ ">Lux Capital’s Deena Shakir,</a> who sees space and frontier tech going mainstream right now. Anyone else feel a moonshot theme arising in 2021?</p>

<h2>Why Singapore might become Asia’s Silicon Valley</h2>
<p>In this Extra Crunch story, Catherine Shu argues that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/singapore-is-poised-to-become-asias-silicon-valley/">Singapore might become Asia’s next Silicon Valley. </a>The long-time global financial hub will expect hundreds of new jobs in the next few years as ByteDance and Alibaba reportedly plan regional offices in the city-state. The interest comes as Google, Facebook, and Twilio already have operations in Singapore.</p>
<p>The spotlight comes with pressure on companies to find the best tech talent in Singapore, which has a population of 5.6 million.</p>
<p>Kuo-Yi Lim, co-founder and managing partner at early-stage investment firm Monk’s Hill Ventures, detailed the talent dynamics:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“My view is that there will always be the need to bring in folks who are not from Singapore because we’re just not big enough,” he said.</em></p>
<p><em>“The competition is more on a global basis, because even local startups will always be looking at global talent, from the region, Australia, India, China or beyond,” he added. “I think it actually cultivates the instinct for startups to really compete for talent in a thoughtful way. I think startups will have to become more creative and sharper in terms of how they position themselves as an attractive employer to spend time with, as opposed to the big companies.”</em></p></blockquote>

<h2>Quick IPO update</h2>
<p>After Roblox and Affirm pushed their IPOs because market conditions were too hot, the delay proved to be an opportunity for others. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/bumble-reportedly-filed-confidentially-for-an-ipo/">Bumble</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/uipath-files-confidential-ipo-paperwork-with-sec/">UiPath</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">Coinbase</a> filed to go public confidentially, meaning that the intent is now known but there are no numbers for us to go through. Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/unpacking-poshmarks-ipo-filing/">Poshmark filed its S-1</a> and <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/the-stockx-megaround-smells-like-pre-ipo-money/">StockX raised a round</a> that Alex Wilhelm thinks could be pre-IPO money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday the U.S. Department of Commerce included <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dji" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dji">DJI <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> among the 77 new entries on its ‘entity list.’ Precisely what this means for the company’s future in the States remains uncertain, but it has since responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>
<p>“DJI is disappointed in the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s decision,” a spokesperson for the drone giant tells TechCrunch. “Customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally. DJI remains committed to developing the industry&#8217;s most innovative products that define our company and benefit the world.”</p>

<p>As the prior example of Huawei demonstrated, repercussions for inclusion on the list can evolve over time, depending on – among other things – the strength of relations between the U.S. and China. The smartphone giant was dealt a major blow after being cutoff from access to key U.S. originated technology, including Google’s Android.</p>
<p>The reason for DJI’s inclusion is part of a broad focus on “wide-scale human rights abuse” – likely more specifically focused on the subset of “high-technology surveillance.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the entry:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ERC determined to add the entities AGCU Scientech; China National Scientific Instruments and Materials (CNSIM); DJI; and Kuang-Chi Group for activities contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests. Specifically, these four entities have enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance, and/or facilitated the export of items by China that aid repressive regimes around the world, contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the many larger factors at play in DJI’s position in the U.S. is the shape of relations with China under the incoming Biden administration. The decision could have an even more immediate impact on the many state and federal agencies that currently utilize the drone-maker&#8217;s products.</p>

<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business.

<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">launched</a> its promised <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/">App Store privacy labels</a> across all its App Stores, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. The labels aim to give Apple customers an easier way to understand what sort of information an app collects across three categories: data used to track you, data linked to you and data not linked to you. Tracking, Apple explains, refers to the act of linking either user or device data collected from an app with user or device data collected from other apps, websites or even offline properties (like data aggregated from retail receipts) that’s used for targeted advertising or advertisement measurement. It can also include sharing user or device data with data brokers.</p>
<p>This aspect alone will expose the industry of third-party adtech and analytics SDKs (software development kits) — basically code from external vendors that developers add to their apps to boost their revenues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, “data linked to you” is the personal information tied to your identity through your user account on the app, your device or other details. (You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">read more about the program here</a>.)</p>

<h3>Apple and Facebook fight over privacy changes</h3>
<p>Also this week, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">took out full-page newspaper ads</a> to attack Apple&#8217;s upcoming privacy-centered changes, alleging that the decision will have negative impacts on small businesses. With a forthcoming update to iOS 14, developers will have to ask users permission to use their IDFA identifiers for ad targeting purposes, and they&#8217;ll have very few characters to explain why it&#8217;s necessary. Most users, who are sick of having their data taken and resold without any personal control over that process, will likely just say &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the one hand, Facebook has much to lose as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">already warned</a> that without targeting and personalization, mobile app install campaigns brought in 50% less revenue for publishers. And the impacts to Facebook Audience Network on iOS will be even worse. But Facebook says it&#8217;s well-diversified enough so this one change won&#8217;t hurt its business as much as it will smaller ones run by &#8220;aspiring entrepreneurs.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hezYiah7zB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">Facebook isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming ad tracking restrictions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook isn&#8217;t happy about Apple&#8217;s upcoming ad tracking restrictions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/embed/#?secret=hezYiah7zB" data-secret="hezYiah7zB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It also pointed out that Apple&#8217;s interests aren&#8217;t only about consumer choice. When developers make less money from the traditional targeted ads, they&#8217;ll turn to other means of generating revenues &#8212; like in-app purchases and subscriptions, benefiting Apple.</p>
<p>We should also point out that Apple does a lot of data gathering and targeting of its own. In your iOS Privacy Settings, when you scroll <em>way</em> down to the bottom of the page, then click on Apple Advertising followed by View Ad Targeting Information, you&#8217;ll find Apple&#8217;s own admissions of how it tracks you across its platform, including data from your account info (age, gender, location), and by what content you&#8217;ve downloaded on Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple Books and the App Store. It uses this data to target you with personalized ads on the App Store, in Apple News and in Stocks.</p>
<p>Apple, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/15/apple-app-store-privacy-screens-about-facebook-extensive-alarming.html">has presented Facebook&#8217;s tracking business</a> as one that aims to &#8220;collect as much data as possible,&#8221; in order to &#8220;develop and monetize detailed profiles of their users,&#8221; in a &#8220;disregard to user privacy.&#8221; And while it&#8217;s true that Facebook&#8217;s network spans apps and websites, Apple is doing the same thing within its own ecosystem&#8230;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/27/a-billion-iphones/">of a billion iPhones</a> and other devices. Devices where Apple&#8217;s own apps are often pre-installed and compete with third-party services in areas like books, music, TV, fitness, news and more.</p>
<p>Plus, Apple told developers when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">launched the new App Store privacy labels</a> this week, that developers don&#8217;t have to disclose the data collected by Apple itself. Uh, wonder why that is?</p>
<p>Instead, developers have to come clean about all the other ways they collect and use customer data, including if data brokers are involved.</p>
<p>The move of course is a big gain for consumer privacy, as it establishes a new baseline for the industry, lays bare the amount to which users are tracked and forces companies to re-establish trust with their customers instead of sneaking behind their back to gather and sell their data. But it&#8217;s simultaneously an easy smokescreen for Apple&#8217;s own interests, and Apple should not get a pass on that aspect just because it&#8217;s also &#8220;a very good thing.&#8221; Apple wanted a bigger portion of the adtech market and to grow its subscription business <em>and</em> it wants to fight for consumer privacy. But it largely only highlights the latter when speaking to reporters or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/apple-responds-to-facebook-tracking-criticism/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">making public statements</a>.</p>
<p>The risk of criticizing Apple for such a pro-consumer move is that it looks like a defense of Facebook. But this issue is too complex to require that you simply choose sides. There are ways that Apple can both tackle consumer privacy issues and be more upfront about its own ongoing data collection practices &#8212; and burying its data collection/ad targeting info at the very bottom of the iOS Privacy settings page is not it.</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this week <a href="https://periscope.medium.com/farewell-periscope-164db2742b7c">announced</a> it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">shutting down its standalone livestreaming app</a> Periscope, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/13/how-periscope-works/">acquired</a> in 2015. The company said the app had been &#8220;an unsustainable maintenance-mode state&#8221; for some time, and Twitter has seen its usage decline as costs went up. The app will no longer function by March 2021, but Twitter says it&#8217;s not giving up on live video. It notes that it brought most of Periscope&#8217;s core capabilities to Twitter over the years.</p>
<p>Users will be able to download an archive of their Periscope broadcasts and data before the app is removed and those that have been published to Twitter will continue to live on as replays.</p>

<p>Twitter has a history of making bad calls on its standalone apps that seemed like smart decisions at the time. The company was early to the idea that music and social could work well when tied together when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/18/twitter-music-impressions-strengths-weaknesses/?_ga=2.221591576.1050288253.1607954337-508606782.1595599686">it launched a standalone Twitter Music app</a> in 2013. Years later, other companies have proven that to be true &#8212; TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok-music-2020">said this week</a> its app is driving hits, and got 70-some artists major label record deals. In 2020, over 176 songs passed 1 billion views as TikTok sounds.</p>

<p>Another idea Twitter killed, of course, was Vine, the app that could have been <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had it lasted.</p>
<p>Now Twitter is killing its live video app, a project it abandoned, as everyone else is figuring out how to turn live video streams into e-commerce transactions. Today, Facebook and Instagram offer live video shopping, including in Instagram Reels, its TikTok rival. And TikTok itself launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">first big test of livestreamed video shopping</a> in partnership with Walmart. Other big names who are investing in live video shopping include Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/08/amazon-live-is-the-retailers-latest-effort-to-take-on-qvc-with-live-streamed-video/">through its QVC-like Amazon Live</a>, Alibaba <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/alibaba-aliexpress-influencer-recruitment/">through AliExpress</a>, JD.com, Pinduoduo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/wechat-livestreaming-china-economy/">WeChat</a> and TikTok’s Chinese sister app, Douyin.</p>
<p>One could argue that Twitter just wants to stake out its own place and not follow the crowd, but its latest big feature was Stories, er, Fleets, a format that&#8217;s just about everywhere. And its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">current test product is Spaces</a>, a rival to Clubhouse and a handful of other audio-networking startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has placed its contract manufacturing partner Wistron on probation and won&#8217;t give the Taiwanese firm any new business until it takes “complete corrective actions” following lapses at its southern India plant earlier this month.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker said on Saturday that its employees and independent auditors hired by the company to investigate the issues at Wistron’s Narasapura facility found that Apple’s ‘Supplier Code of Conduct’ was violated at the facility and Wistron failed to implement proper working hour management processes. This led to “payment delays for some workers in October and November,” Apple said, citing preliminary findings.</p>
<p>“As always, our focus is on making sure everyone in our supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect. We are very disappointed and taking immediate steps to address these issues. Wistron has taken disciplinary action and is restructuring their recruitment and payroll teams in Narasapura,” Apple said in the statement. &#8220;Apple employees, along with independent auditors, will monitor their progress.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alleging unpaid salaries, workers vandalize iPhone manufacturing unit near Bengaluru <a href="https://t.co/pbW6xAwA0I">pic.twitter.com/pbW6xAwA0I</a></p>
<p>&mdash; The Indian Express (@IndianExpress) <a href="https://twitter.com/IndianExpress/status/1337730427985874944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Thousands of workers rioted over unpaid salaries &#8212; of about $200 a month &#8212; on December 12 at Wistron’s Narasapura facility &#8212; situated about 40 miles outside of the tech hub Bangalore &#8212; destroying windows and other properties, iPhones, and factory equipments. Wistron, a key manufacturing partner for Apple in India, has this year more than quadrupled workers and ramped up its production capacity in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>A report by the Karnataka state government concluded this week that <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3114491/wistrons-apple-factory-india-committed-serious-violations">serious violations of labor laws</a> &#8212; including underpayment of wages, and irregular hours and poor working conditions &#8212; were taking place at Wistron&#8217;s facility in India. The report, which estimated that assets worth $7 million were damaged in the recent riot, said Wistron could not cope up with managing the recent scaling up of manpower at its facility.</p>
<p>In a statement earlier today, Wistron acknowledged that some workers at its plant had not been paid properly. It also announced that it was removing a top executive who oversaw Taiwanese firm’s India business. &#8220;Some of the processes we put in place to manage labor agencies and payments need to be strengthened and upgraded. We are also enhancing our processes and restructuring our teams to ensure these issues cannot happen again. We have established an employee assistance program for workers at the facility. We also set up a 24-hour grievance hotline in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Hindi and English to ensure all workers can voice any concerns they may have anonymously,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Wistron assembles older iPhone models at its Indian facility. In recent years, Apple has broadened its partnership with others &#8212; including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/foxconn" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="foxconn">Foxconn <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; to expand the iPhone production capacity in the world&#8217;s second largest smartphone market, where it currently commands about 1% market share. Earlier this year, Foxconn started to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/apple-begins-assembling-iphone-11-in-india/">assemble the iPhone 11 models at its Indian facilities</a>. Assembling handsets in India enables smartphone vendors to avoid roughly 20% import duty that the Indian government levies on imported electronics products.</p>
<p>&#8220;India is democratic. Its unions are vocal, and local politicians have to be responsive. Foreign companies eager to tap the large domestic market and vast labor pool will need to adjust to the reality that workers may be more quick to stand up for their interests. And Cook will need to get used to his company’s name alongside words like riot and uprising. In many respects, it’s unfair to pick on Apple — the latest complaints appear aimed squarely at Wistron — yet the U.S. company is the client and wields the power to force change, something it’s done in China over the past decade,&#8221; Bloomberg columnist Tim Culpan <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-14/apple-supplier-taiwan-s-wistron-runs-into-labor-unrest-in-india?sref=gni836kR">wrote</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s probably no wonder that when <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/founders-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="founders-fund">Founders Fund <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was still a very young venture firm, it brought aboard as its first principal Justin Fishner-Wolfson. Having nabbed two degrees from Stanford and spent two years as CEO of an <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.sse.stanford.edu/">organization</a> that provides asset management services to the school&#8217;s student organizations, Fishner-Wolfson wasn&#8217;t shy about voicing his opinions at the venture fund. In fact, he says Founders Fund made a much bigger bet on SpaceX than it originally planned because he pushed for it.</p>
<p>He stayed three years before spying what he thought was an even better opportunity, owing to friends who worked at Facebook before the company&#8217;s 2012 IPO. They were beginning to look for ways to liquidate their shares, and while they had options, to his mind, they weren&#8217;t great. More, Fishner-Wolfson says he foresaw more companies like Facebook staying private longer. He said goodbye to Founders Fund and formed <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://137ventures.com/">137 Ventures </a>to acquire secondary shares from founders, investors, and employees.</p>
<p>That was 10 years ago, and the firm seems to be doing just fine for itself. Last year, it closed its fourth fund with $250 million in capital commitments, bringing its assets under management to more than $1 billion. Its approach of focusing on roughly 10 to 12 companies per fund appears to be paying off, too. Since late September, it has seen three of its portfolio companies &#8212; Palantir, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Wish &#8212; hit the public market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked at length with Fishner-Wolfson this week to learn more about how <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/137-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="137-ventures">137 Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> works, from how it screens companies, to the impact it has seen from companies that are giving their employees longer windows in which to keep their vested stock options. (&#8220;It has certainly stopped the desperate calls from people who have huge amounts of equity that&#8217;s about to expire, which, I&#8217;m totally happy to not get those phone calls, because I feel terrible for people who are in that sort of situation,&#8221; he said.)</p>
<p>We also talked about that early deal in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which also appears in 137 Ventures&#8217;s portfolio.</p>
<p>You can listen to that longer conversation <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/6920195">here</a>. In the meantime, we&#8217;re pulling out part of our conversation that centered on Wish, the discount e-commerce company whose IPO this week has been called a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2020/three-reasons-why-wish-parents-widely-anticipated-ipo-was-a-dud/">dud</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Two of your portfolio companies have done very well as they&#8217;ve entered the public market &#8212; Palantir and Airbnb. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wish" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wish">Wish <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was a different story, dropping in its debut. What do you make of its IPO? Do you think investors misunderstand this company?</strong></p>
<p>JFW: I think it takes the investment community a long time to understand any newly public company. At the end of the day, the IPO is just one day, right? What really matters is how companies perform over the next 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p>I would look at Microsoft or Amazon or more recently, Facebook, whose [share price] dropped 50% in the week or two following its offering and Facebook has gone on to be an incredible business. I have no idea what the market is going to do tomorrow [or] the day after. But over a decade, if you can really build a great sustainable business that compounds, it all comes out in the wash.</p>
<p>Wish has done an incredible job of scaling the business. I think [cofounder and CEO] Peter [Szulczewski] is one of the best operators I&#8217;ve met in this industry. And they&#8217;ve done a lot of innovative things in terms of mobile. There&#8217;s a lot more discovery on the Wish platform. The whole in-store pickup has been really innovative; they&#8217;re helping consumers get products quickly in an asset-light kind of way where you don&#8217;t need to buy millions and millions of square feet of warehouses.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re talking about these partnerships that Wish starting striking with mom-and-pop shops in the U.S. and Europe, where those who have extra storage space will now take receipt of Wish goods, which in turn gives them a little bit more foot traffic when people come in to pick up their items. That&#8217;s a big shift from how Wish used to operate, which was by shipping things very cheaply from China through a USPS deal whose economics have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/trump-changes-terminal-dues-and-epacket-rates/573337/">since changed</a>. Is that right?</strong></p>
<p>JFW: Right. They&#8217;re helping small and medium-size businesses drive foot traffic, which was always valuable but in the current environment, going to become even more important to these sorts of businesses. They&#8217;re [also] helping those businesses leverage the data they have across their entire platform because Wish understands what consumers in that geography are looking for, and they can help those businesses merchandise better. And then, because they&#8217;re shipping product to one location, they&#8217;re aggregating orders from a whole bunch of people who don&#8217;t know each other, and that reduces logistics and shipping time and costs. So they send that stuff in, and it&#8217;s easier for the consumer to walk or drive five to 15 minutes, and go pick it up. That allows Wish to focus on the value-conscious consumer who is willing to trade a little bit of time for a much better price on things.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Wish is known as a place to get tchotchkes from China. Now that it&#8217;s trying to sell more mainstream goods, how does it go about changing the perception that it has in the marketplace?</strong></p>
<p>JFW: I&#8217;m not sure they need to do a whole lot to change that perception, because I still think they haven&#8217;t penetrated the market as a whole. There are lots of people who don&#8217;t even know about them quite frankly. And as [I&#8217;ve] watched the marketplace evolve, you&#8217;ve just seen more and more merchants, and more and more data back from customers about both the merchants and the quality of the merchandise, and all those things feed back into this very powerful system, where they can leverage the data to improve product quality and make sure that they&#8217;re selling what people want.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you think uneven quality explains the company&#8217;s uneven revenue? It grew something like 57% in 2018, then 10% in 2019, and picked up again in the first nine months of this year. Why do you think it&#8217;s been topsy turvy?</strong></p>
<p>JFW: All businesses go through these cycles of growth, and then focusing on efficiency. If you just focus on growth, you tend to grow, and then break things, and then do things in relatively inefficient ways. And then ultimately, you need to turn around and focus on how you drive operational efficiencies. So I think the cycles that you&#8217;re describing, if you look at the underlying metrics, you [see] improvement in operating efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Wish&#8217;s shares did not &#8220;pop.&#8221; On the other hand, former Snap executive Imran Khan told CNBC on Tuesday that the recent post IPO stock pops, including those of Airbnb and Doordash, represent an &#8220;epic level of incompetency&#8221; from the bankers who underwrote the stocks. Do you believe it was incompetency on the part of the bankers or just market volatility that caused those stocks to pop as high as they did?</strong></p>
<p>JFW: I think no one actually knows the answer to that question. I think it makes for a good sound bite. At the end of the day, I don&#8217;t think the price on the first day is a meaningful indicator of anything.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are the feverish embrace of these companies driving prices up in the secondary market? What are you seeing?</strong></p>
<p>It really does matter what the public prices are [because] that ultimately trickles into the private markets and also vice versa. At some point, things can&#8217;t have massive differences in value between their private market valuations and their public market valuations. So you definitely see multiples shift as the market shifts. But these things are often averages. People focus on one company or one example of these things without necessarily looking at all the companies because that would be quite difficult.</p>
<p>But there are always examples of things that are overpriced. There are also examples of things that are under priced. As an investor, you want to try to invest more of your money in the good companies that are on the lower end of that spectrum, certainly. But the focus is always on good companies. If you can find companies that are going to compound over long periods of time, as long as you&#8217;re not too crazy on multiples or valuations, you end up being in a good spot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Moderna&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine, as expected after an independent panel commissioned by the administration recommended its approval earlier this week. This is the second vaccine now authorized for use in the U.S. under EUA, after the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pfizer" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pfizer">Pfizer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-BioNTech vaccine was approved last week.</p>
<p>Moderna&#8217;s vaccine could begin being administered to Americans by &#8220;Monday or Tuesday&#8221; next week, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci <a href="https://www.today.com/video/dr-fauci-anticipates-moderna-vaccine-will-be-administered-by-early-next-week-97983045529">speaking to NBC&#8217;s Today show in a new interview</a>. That&#8217;s in keeping with the timelines between the Pfizer EUA and the first patients actually receiving the vaccine last week.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FDA grants emergency use authorization for Pfizer&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine, distribution to begin within days&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/fda-grants-emergency-use-authorization-for-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-to-begin-within-days/embed/#?secret=jGwUEytd7d" data-secret="jGwUEytd7d" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine, Moderna&#8217;s is an mRNA therapy. That means that it contains no actual virus &#8212; just genetic instructions that tell a person&#8217;s body to create a specific protein. That protein is more or less identical to the one that SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, uses to attach to a host&#8217;s cells and replicate. Moderna&#8217;s vaccine causes a person to create just the protein, which on its own is harmless, and then their natural defenses via their immune system react to that and develop a method for fighting it off. That defense system is &#8220;remembered&#8221; by the body, while the vaccine itself naturally dissolves after a brief time, leaving a person with immunity but nothing else.</p>
<p>The Oxford-<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astrazeneca" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astrazeneca">AstraZeneca <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> vaccine, which has yet to be approved for use in the U.S., uses a weakened and modified common cold virus that doesn&#8217;t spread in humans to create the spike protein in recipients, resulting in the body generating its own immune response. That&#8217;s a much more tried-and-tested method for creating a vaccine, but both Moderna and Pfizer&#8217;s mRNA therapies have shown to be very effective in preliminary data from their large Phase 3 clinical trials.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm keeps a close watch on the public markets in his column The Exchange, but this week, he branched out to look at some of the metrics underpinning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/">soaring cryptocurrency prices</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/the-stockx-megaround-smells-like-pre-ipo-money/">turned his gaze on StockX</a>, the consumer reseller marketplace that just raised $275 million in a Series E that values the company at approximately $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Selling a tenth of your company for north of a quarter-billion may be somewhat common among late-stage software startups with tremendous growth,&#8221; he says, but &#8220;don’t laugh — the round actually makes pretty OK sense.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our staff continues to file their end-of-year stories: We ran a post this morning by Manish Singh that studies<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/from-indias-richest-man-to-amazon-and-100s-of-startups-the-great-rush-to-win-neighborhood-stores/"> India&#8217;s massive total addressable market for retail</a>. The nation has more than 60 million mom-and-pop neighborhood stores, and companies like Walmart and Amazon are eager to offer help with payments, logistics and inventory management — as are hundreds of native and foreign startups.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/hype-machine-sinan-aral/">an interview with author and MIT professor Sinan Aral</a>, Managing Editor Danny Crichton discussed some of the debates currently swirling around the desire in some quarters to regulate social media platforms. In &#8220;The Hype Machine,&#8221; Aral explores topics like neuroscience, economics and misinformation before offering potential solutions for resolving what he calls &#8220;a full-blown social media crisis.&#8221;</p>

<p>How did fashion marketplace Poshmark go from posting regular losses in 2019 to generating net income in 2020?</p>
<p>After the company filed a public S-1 last night, Alex Wilhelm pondered the question this morning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/unpacking-poshmarks-ipo-filing/">in The Exchange</a>.</p>
<p>Like many e-commerce platforms, Poshmark saw a surge in activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it also slashed its marketing spend, which helped boost profits. As the cash-rich company prepares its road show, &#8220;Poshmark is valuable,&#8221; Alex concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;How valuable the market will decide. But who will it enrich with its final pricing decision?&#8221;</p>

<p>The breach of FireEye and SolarWinds by hackers working on behalf of Russian intelligence is &#8220;the nightmare scenario that has worried cybersecurity experts for years,&#8221; reports Zack Whittaker.</p>
<p>The intrusion began several months ago, but news of the breach wasn&#8217;t made public until this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given that potential victims include defense contractors, telecoms, banks, and tech companies, the implications for critical infrastructure and national security, although untold at this point, could be significant,&#8221; said Erin Kenneally, director of cyber risk analytics at Guidewire, an industry platform for insurance carriers.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">his analysis for Extra Crunch</a>, Zack breaks down the rippling effects of supply-chain attacks that can compromise platforms like SolarWinds, which is used by more than 420 of the Fortune 500.</p>

<p>Embedded finance connects services like payment processing with everyday activities like grabbing a coffee before unlocking an e-scooter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to be at the right place at the right time, supporting consumers and merchants alike, where they want it, how they want it and when they want it — cannot be understated,&#8221; says Simon Wu, an investment director with Cathay Innovation.</p>
<p>In a post that identifies embedded finance&#8217;s top providers and enablers, he offers advice for startups and established brands that are hoping to &#8220;earn and build customer loyalty while generating new revenue streams.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bitcoin is at an all-time high.</p>
<p>CoinMarketCap reports that crypto market values have reached almost $659 billion; that figure was just $140 billion in March 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;These gains have created a huge amount of wealth for crypto holders,&#8221; Alex Wilhelm wrote yesterday.</p>
<p>To get a better handle on why crypto values are sky-bound, he parsed some basic industry metrics, including the number of unique bitcoin addresses, fees paid and transactions per day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the price gains make sense in the short term? Who knows,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;but they are not based on nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>For his year-end Extra Crunch story, security reporter Zack Whittaker looked back at the myriad security challenges and vulnerabilities COVID-19 brought to the fore.</p>
<p>The hacks of Fire Eyes and SolarWinds were just one link in the chain: How well is your company prepared to deal with file-encrypting malware, hackers backed by nation-states or employees accessing secure systems from home?</p>
<p>&#8220;With 2020 wrapping up, much of the security headaches exposed by the pandemic will linger into the new year,&#8221; says Zack.</p>

<p>After six years of research and development, autonomous vehicle company Zoox this week unveiled an electric robotaxi that can carry four people at a maximum speed of 75 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Automotive writer Kirsten Korosec interviewed Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson to learn more about the vehicle&#8217;s development and how the company overcame a series of technical and legal challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that if you have a big idea and you’re confident that it makes sense, you should at least explore the idea, rather than giving up because the current regulations aren’t designed for it,&#8221; said Levinson.</p>
<p>Kirsten only had 15 minutes to interview Levinson, but this comprehensive interview covers topics like regulatory compliance, Zoox&#8217;s relationship with parent company Amazon and the highest (and lowest) moments he experienced along the way.</p>

<p>In one of the largest enterprise acquisitions of 2020, Visa Equity Partners this week purchased Utah-based edtech startup Pluralsight for $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>According to the entrepreneurs and investors reporter Natasha Mascarenhas spoke to, this deal &#8220;shows the strength of edtech’s capital options as the pandemic continues.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What’s happening in edtech is that capital markets are liquidating,&#8221; a major change from &#8220;the old days where the options to exit were very narrow,&#8221; says Deborah Quazzo, a managing partner at GSV Advisors and seed investor in Pluralsight.</p>

<p>Founders and the VCs who back them may not be friends, but they&#8217;re usually friendly.</p>
<p>Investors are on a first-name basis with entrepreneurs from their portfolio companies and frequently have candid conversations with them about life, work and the world in general. In the before times, they might even have shared a meal or attended a baseball game together.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, it is a top-down relationship — the investor will always have the upper hand. When an entrepreneur accepts a check, they are hiring their next boss.</p>
<p>In an Extra Crunch guest post, Quiq CEO and founder Mike Myer poses two questions for founders who are considering a new relationship with a VC:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can the investor help the business?</li>
<li>What’s the risk that the investor will hurt the business?</li>
</ul>

<p>In India, about 90% of consumers buy their everyday goods from neighborhood-based <i>kirana</i> stores instead of supermarkets.</p>
<p>As a result, U.S. retail giants like Walmart and Amazon have adopted an &#8220;if you can&#8217;t beat them, join them&#8221; approach, offering the nation&#8217;s 60 million mom-and-pop shops software for inventory control, payments and e-commerce.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s retail market will be worth an estimated $1.3 trillion by 2025, but e-commerce represents just 3% of that activity today, reports Manish Singh.</p>
<p>For his final Extra Crunch story of 2020, he looked at the startups and major players who are hoping to carve out their niche in one of the world&#8217;s largest retail ecosystems.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, business productivity software startup ClickUp raised a $35 million Series A.</p>
<p>Now, just six months later, the company has closed a second round of $100 million that values the San Diego-based startup at $1 billion.</p>
<p>Lucas Matney interviewed CEO Zeb Evans this week to learn more about how the company was buoyed by pandemic-based behavior shifts that doubled its customer base and multiplied revenue by a factor of nine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the biggest thing that we’ve always focused on is shipping a new version of ClickUp every week. That is our differentiation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’ve kind of created these iterative cycles called natural product-market fit and it’s been hard to keep up with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 2018, the total value of the year&#8217;s 10 top enterprise mergers and acquisitions reached $87 billion; last year, that figure fell to just $40 billion.</p>
<p>But in 2020, 10 M&amp;A deals accounted for $165.2 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year’s biggest deal — Salesforce buying Tableau for $15.7 billion — would have only been good for fifth place on this year’s list,&#8221; notes enterprise reporter Ron Miller. &#8220;And last year’s fourth largest deal, where VMware bought Pivotal for $2.7 billion, wouldn’t have even made this year’s list at all.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch&#8217;s 2020 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We&#8217;re here to help!

<p>Headphones! They make a pretty solid gift any year, but they&#8217;re an even better option when so many of us are stuck at home. It&#8217;s hard to think (much less get anything done) when the background track of your life is a cacophony of conference calls and Zoom school.</p>
<p>We spent a lot of time with a lot of different headphones this year, so we thought it&#8217;d be good to highlight some of our favorites. As with all things audio-related, &#8220;best&#8221; is deeply subjective — but these ones all absolutely earned our stamp of approval. Between over-ear, on-ear, in-ear and gaming headsets, we&#8217;ve got the bases covered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><em>Darrell writes:</em></p>
<p>Marshall’s latest on-ear headphones combine great sound with a lightweight design, and some unique benefits &#8212; including over 80 hours of playtime on a single charge. They also charge either via USB-C or wirelessly with most standard chargers, by folding them up and resting them on their right ear cup. The on-ear design means no noise cancellation and noise isolation is minimal, so they&#8217;re not great for commutes but a very solid choice for the home office. For the price, they’re a great deal, and a stylish accessory, to boot.</p>

<p>If you need really serious noise canceling and you aren&#8217;t willing to sacrifice on sound quality, Sony&#8217;s WH-1000XM4 over-ear headphones are a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Widely regarded as the best at what they do, these headphones actually do quite a few different things very, very well. The sleek over-ear design and sophisticated active noise canceling means they can create a totally silent work environment if that&#8217;s what you want. And if you&#8217;re just in it for Sony&#8217;s signature killer, punchy sound, that&#8217;s enough of a reason to buy them too. (Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are another top-tier pick for over-ear noise canceling if you prefer their look or Bose’s more neutral sound.) For a budget pick, Sony’s last-gen Sony WH-1000XM3 offer the same sound quality and noise canceling with a few fewer bells and whistles.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$278 <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-wh-1000xm4-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-black/6408356.p?skuId=6408356&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;extStoreId=144&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAw_H-BRD-ARIsALQE_2N8oRhj-HLRJH1w_-uzWir1jOdV24o2exV6ItmYVEDVxVPtO6fFFPAaAlEIEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">from Best Buy</a></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veanne writes:</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MW65s are Master &amp; Dynamic’s wireless over-ear noise-canceling model. Between deejaying at dirty underground raves in my early twenties and editing videos for the next decade, I have probably gone through about two dozen headphones. By far, the MW65s are my favorite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They&#8217;re beautifully designed, and well-constructed with lightweight anodized aluminum and premium leather. The 40mm beryllium drivers deliver clarity throughout the spectrum and audiophiles will love their natural sound profile. The memory foam ear pads already do a decent job of muffling out garbage trucks and police sirens, but the ANC is great for shutting out the world — on high mode, it’s eerily silent. The MW65s work wirelessly via Bluetooth 4.2 with 65+ feet of signal range &#8212; a must-have for grabbing snacks from the fridge while on important Zoom meetings or to avoid accidentally yanking the laptop off the table. Bonus feature: Google Assistant integration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They&#8217;ll cost you a steep $400+, but they’re solid headphones and you’re ultimately paying for luxury.</span></p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RHWDY9N/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07RHWDY9N&amp;linkId=18c0a78b76be84fbc85a73403270602e">$400 on Amazon</a></p>

<p>The days seem longer when working from home and these Denon headphones are comfortable to wear from morning to night. And better yet, they sound fantastic with rich bass and crisp highs. The soundstage is incredible and the large cups easily block outside noise from interrupting your jam session. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">From hip hop to alt to underground indie classics, everything sounds better on these Denon headphones. I can’t get enough of these Denon headphones. In OutKast’s SpottieOttieDopaliscious the horns play over a lovely low-fi beat track. Uncle Tupelo&#8217;s Sandusky is heavenly.</span></p>
<p>There’s a downside to these Denon headphones: to really come alive, they require more power than a computer or phone alone provide. When tested on a computer, the headphones are great. When tested with a desktop headphone amp, they&#8217;re out of this world.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong>: <a href="https://www.denon.com/en-us/product/over-ear-headphones/ah-d5200">Currently $699 from Denon</a></p>

<p>Out of all the headphones in this series, this set of cans from Grado are the most polarizing. On one side, they sound fantastic. The audio is crisp, clean, and complex. Silver Lining by Mt. Joy manages to be peaceful but powerful with strong guitar strums and complete soundstage. Turn on Heart of Gold from Neil Young and it’s more of the same: the sound is clean and pure. These headphones are for purists. The housing is made out of compressed hemp and maple, which the company says balances the sound and produces some of the best audio properties of any of its headphones. True to their name and inspiration, the hemp headphones cost $420.</p>
<p>While the audio is fantastic, these headphones perhaps fall short from being good work from home headphones. There’s very little sound isolation from the foam pads and open design. I’m wearing the headphones while I type this section and can clearly hear the click-clack of my mechanical keyboard while Sublime’s Steppin’ Razor plays through the cans.</p>
<p>Grado is a family-owned outfit from Brooklyn where three generations work for the company. The company started building phono cartridges, expanded into building speakers, and currently sells headphones and phono cartridges. These headphones are hand-built in Brooklyn and are available with numerous options including terminating the wire with an XLR connector instead of the standard 3.5mm plug.</p>

<p>It should come as no surprise that Sony&#8217;s prowess in over-ear noise canceling translates extremely well to a smaller form factor. Earbuds can’t match the sweet silence that over-ear designs provide, but if you don’t like big ol’ headphones, the compromise is likely worth it. Sony’s earbuds are a great choice, tuning out a shocking amount of outside noise in a very small package. Like the Sony over-ear pick, they have incredible sound, a very attractive design and come with a huge selection of rubbery caps of different sizes and textures to make them comfortable in different ears. If you value Apple connectivity above all else, pick the AirPods pro. If sound quality or silence matter more, you won’t be disappointed here.</p>

<p>Though Apple is now positioning the $249 AirPods Pro as the mid-range product in the AirPods line with the introduction of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/this-is-not-a-review-of-apples-new-airpod-max-headphones/">ludicrously priced $549 AirPods Max</a>, they are still Apple’s headphone product that seems to have the biggest lead over mainstream competitors.</p>
<p>Features like passthrough mode and spatial audio are nice but are likely features you will use pretty infrequently depending on your setup. As with the less expensive non-Pro AirPods, you’ll be sure to find better sound quality in Bluetooth headphones at this price, but you won’t find a better total package that involves so little troubleshooting, a tight package and such quality noise cancellation. The AirPods Pro are a finessed product that just work in a way that makes using other wireless buds comparably painful.</p>
<p>Retailers are really looking to move product this holiday season, so if you’re prodigious, you’ll likely be able to score a good deal on these headphones, so if you’re plotting an upgrade or trying to see what all the buzz is about, I recommend you take the plunge.</p>

<p>Whether you&#8217;re planning on playing games on a PC or any console out there, the SteelSeries Arctis 7 gets an unreserved recommendation from me. These headphones have amazing sound in a surprisingly large soundstage, making them suitable for any gaming or media. They&#8217;re also light and comfortable while offering decent isolation (and can pipe in surrounding noise if you want). Plus there&#8217;s a built-in telescoping mic for chatting. There are two versions, one for PlayStation and one for Xbox consoles, though both work with PC.</p>
<p>Their downsides are a cluttered physical interface — there&#8217;s a lot going on on the undersides of the earcups — and a corded, multi-part (rather than USB key shaped) wireless dongle. But these are minor issues considering what you get for the $150 price.</p>

<p>While on the pricier end for a gaming headset, SteelSeries&#8217; Arctis Pros are outstanding. They&#8217;re extremely comfortable largely thanks to a ski-goggle inspired suspension headband, and swappable rechargeable batteries (one in the headset, one charging in the base station) help ensure you&#8217;re never caught scrambling for a charging cable mid-battle. A dedicated mixer helps you tweak the sound to your liking even in games where it&#8217;s otherwise locked, and a very visible mute indicator on the tip of the microphone makes it clear whether you&#8217;re on air or not. One catch: they&#8217;ll work with PC, Mac and PlayStation (including PS5 with an upcoming firmware update), but not Xbox.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The idea of satellites and other spacecraft being able to refuel, repair or even add new capabilities while in orbit has generally seemed like a &#8220;nice in theory&#8221; one, but as leaders from Maxar, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astroscale" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astroscale">Astroscale <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Orbit Fab explained at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">TC Sessions: Space</a>, 2021 will be the year that theory becomes reality — or at the very least, realistic.</p>
<p>Once they go up, satellites are generally considered fixed assets that only depreciate, become obsolete or reach the end of their fuel supply and inevitably deorbit. But with a bit of coordination many of these phenomenally expensive spacecraft could have their lives extended in a number of ways, and considering the costs involved in lofting a new one, the prospect may be an attractive one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Launch costs are going down, but also launch frequency, the cadence in which things are being sent up into space is also going up,&#8221; pointed out Lucy Condakchian, GM of robotics at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/macdonald-dettwiler-and-associates" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="macdonald-dettwiler-and-associates">Maxar Technologies <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. &#8220;So if you can launch smaller subsystems payloads and whatnot, and then be able to assemble things in space, maybe change out a certain aspect of what that satellite is doing&#8230; Why can&#8217;t we go up and actually change out a power subsystem, change out a camera mechanism, a computing element, whatever the case may be?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s what Maxar and NASA will be demonstrating next year with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/maxar-and-nasa-will-demonstrate-orbital-spacecraft-assembly-with-a-new-robotic-arm/">OSAM-1, formerly called Restore-L</a>, in which a spacecraft will attempt to service, assemble and manufacture items (hence the name) while on orbit.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Maxar and NASA will demonstrate orbital spacecraft assembly with a new robotic arm&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/maxar-and-nasa-will-demonstrate-orbital-spacecraft-assembly-with-a-new-robotic-arm/embed/#?secret=T3wRq7PZ3I" data-secret="T3wRq7PZ3I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Just being able to demonstrate something in space shows that we can do that, proves the point of &#8216;Yes, it is possible,&#8217; and hopefully it opens up much further opportunities down the road,&#8221; said Condakchian. The company&#8217;s robotic arms for Martian landers have shown their versatility, as well, and there&#8217;s no reason to think that satellite arms won&#8217;t be as broadly useful.</p>
<p>While Maxar is aiming to equip future spacecraft, Ron Lopez, president of Astroscale US (the original company is Japan-based), sees an opportunity in today&#8217;s aging space infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of companies that are developing on orbit inspection services. That&#8217;s for the satellites that are already out there that don&#8217;t have those robotic capabilities, or can&#8217;t afford to have them in the future when the product owner-operator decides not to put them on,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s any number of different use cases for this kind of capability,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Insurance claims if there&#8217;s an anomaly on a satellite, and it needs to be determined what it was that happened, etc., or space situational awareness. Of course, we know that this is a big concern for everybody with the increasing number of objects in space, understanding what&#8217;s where, doing what and is it a threat to other objects in space, is very important.&#8221;</p>

<p>Astroscale, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/astroscale-raises-51-million-in-series-e-funding-to-fuel-its-orbital-sustainability-ambitions/">raised a $51 million Series E</a>, is about to launch a mission in just a few months that will demonstrate orbital debris detection and removal. That doesn&#8217;t mean spare screws dropped by ISS spacewalks — more likely dead satellites that have been left to drift and deorbit on their own time, which could be years from now. All they need is a little push and low-Earth orbit is that much safer and cleaner.</p>
<p>Daniel Faber, CEO and founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/orbit-fab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="orbit-fab">Orbit Fab, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to prevent that situation from occurring in the first place by building what he calls &#8220;gas stations in space.&#8221; It&#8217;s a bit different from the terrestrial ones, closer perhaps to in-flight refueling of jets, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future that Orbit Fab sees is a fully cooperative and bustling in space economy, we don&#8217;t think that that can be achieved by relying on robotics on every spacecraft, there&#8217;s always going to be a need for tow trucks, there&#8217;s always going to be a need for complex robotic servicing when things go wrong, and things break down. And right now, nothing has been designed to be serviced. So you need a tow truck for any of these type of things,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We failed to build a satellite gas tanker because we couldn&#8217;t find the fueling port. So we built one,&#8221; he said, referring to the company&#8217;s RAFTI connector, which dozens of partners are now looking at including in their spacecraft. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had to develop other products and technologies as well to make refueling accessible to our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tanker will have its first orbit tests — you guessed it, next year. A recently announced investment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/gas-stations-in-space-startup-orbit-fab-extends-seed-round-to-6m-with-strategic-investor-munich-re/">bringing their seed total to $6 million</a>, should help make that happen. 2021 is looking to be a big one for many areas of space, but in this particular sector it will be the moment where the capability is proven out, perhaps leading to a major expansion the following year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After reading<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/11/amazon-halo-klobuchar-privacy/"> a review</a><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/amy-klobuchar" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="amy-klobuchar"> of <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Amazon’s new fitness tracker, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/5/35297230-1088-4728-80a6-6a8cd1108a9a/2B62F5B3B4E2A4E04A16A9D01759FF38.121120healthprivacyletter.pdf">penned an open letter</a>.</p>
<p>“Recent reports have raised concerns about the Halo’s access to this extensive personal and private health information,” the lawmaker wrote to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. “Among publicly available consumer health devices, the Halo appears to collect an unprecedented level of personal information.”</p>
<p>The senator is far from the first critic to express concern about the fitness tracker &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-body-scanning-halo-fitness-band-is-now-available-to-everyone-in-the-us/">the Halo</a> raised eyebrows the moment it was unveiled in August. She is, however, one of the few critics in a position to actually do something about the device, which features both an always-on microphone and asks wearers to perform a full body scan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I&#8217;m wearing my <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fitbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fitbit">Fitbit,” <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Klobuchar says in an interview with TechCrunch. She takes a moment before correcting herself. “Oh, I didn&#8217;t put it on this morning. That&#8217;s very bad. I wear a Fitbit nearly every day. I sometimes have gone years without doing it, but since, I&#8217;d say, about February I&#8217;ve been wearing it.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon’s body-scanning Halo fitness band is now available to everyone in the US&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-body-scanning-halo-fitness-band-is-now-available-to-everyone-in-the-us/embed/#?secret=iXClTdtAZ9" data-secret="iXClTdtAZ9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The senator’s not alone, certainly. According to a January 2020 report from Pew, roughly one-in-five U.S. adults regularly wear a smartwatch or fitness tracker. I’m wearing one as I type this, and chances are pretty good you’re wearing one as well. The Halo may cross a line for some, but the device is far from the first tracker to raise concern among privacy advocates. Klobuchar says that while the Halo’s specific level of data collection, “just cries out for some kind of rules and regulations in place,” stronger scrutiny and regulation is needed for the category across the board.</p>
<p>“I really do think there&#8217;s got to be rules in place,” she says. “The reason I&#8217;m writing HHS is because they should play a larger role in ensuring data privacy when it comes to health, but between the HHS and the Federal Trade Commission, they&#8217;ve got to come up with some rules to safeguard private health information. And I think the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Halo is just the ultimate example of it, but there&#8217;s a number of other devices that have the same issues. I&#8217;m thinking there&#8217;s some state regulations going on and things like that, and we just need federal standards.”</p>
<p>The letter lays out four questions for Azar and the HHS, pertaining to the department&#8217;s role in safeguarding health data. Amazon’s defense of the product is two-fold: body scanning and speech collection are optional, and the company does not have direct access to this locally stored data.</p>
<p>Asked for response to the letter, the company tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have been in touch with Senator Klobuchar’s office to address their questions about Amazon Halo. Privacy is foundational to how we designed and built Amazon Halo. Body and Tone are both optional features that are not required to use the product. Amazon does not have access to Body scan images or Tone speech samples. We are transparent about the privacy practices for this service and you can read more in the Amazon Halo privacy whitepaper.</p></blockquote>
<p>“[The letter is] specifically about that they&#8217;re safeguarding the private health information, they&#8217;re ensuring security and privacy,” Klobuchar tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And even if Amazon Halo is saying they&#8217;re doing all of this, we need to have rules of the road in place for any company that does it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Health privacy concerns have been top of mind since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/google-is-acquiring-fitbit/">Google announced plans to acquire Fitbit</a> for $2.1 billion in November 2019. At the time, the deal was expected to close at some point in 2020. That timeline has since proven overly optimistic. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August, Fitbit said the closing date could be pushed as late as May 2021.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic may well have played an issue in that delay, but <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> biggest hurdle thus far has been government approval. A number of groups and individuals have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">raised concern</a> over the deal, including Amnesty International. In August, the EU posited that the deal could “further entrench Google’s market position in the online advertising markets by increasing the already vast amount of data that Google could use for personalization of the ads it serves and displays.”</p>
<p>After launching an investigation into the deal, the Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">greenlit the deal</a> earlier this week &#8212; with major caveats. At the top of the list is Google’s 10-year commitment to not use Fitbit health data for ad targeting. The E.U. has also reserved the right to extend the safeguard by another 10 years beyond that.</p>
<p>Klobuchar says she believes the privacy caveats were necessary. “I think the decision about if they&#8217;re sufficient or not should be made in the U.S. by our own regulators based on the facts. I am glad they created the data silo. […] And I think we need to greatly up our examination of mergers. We should use those mergers to either say ‘no, because they&#8217;re so anti-competitive,’ or to put conditions on them.”</p>

<p>Increased antitrust scrutiny has been a key project for the senator. In August 2019, she introduced the Monopolization Deterrence Act with Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal. Klobuchar says she hopes to get the bill passed after the new president takes office.</p>
<p>“This new session will be the moment,” she tells TechCrunch. “The Trump administration actually brought these major cases. They were late in the game, but they actually did their job here at the end. But the president wasn&#8217;t organized enough in terms of his focus to be able to actually get legislation done on monopolies. And so I think this is going to be incumbent on the Biden administration and the next AG to do that.”</p>
<p>Any meaningful effort to reduce the size and influence of tech corporations will have to go further than simply increasing regulatory scrutiny at the point of acquisition, however. In many cases, that bridge was crossed long ago.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not just future monopoly mergers being considered,” Klobuchar says. “It&#8217;s looking back at what&#8217;s happened. That&#8217;s what the Facebook suit is. That&#8217;s what the Google suit is in a different way. There’s still stuff about DoubleClick and everything, but mostly it&#8217;s about how they&#8217;re using their monopoly power. So you can be sued for looking back at mergers (that’s what they’re doing at Facebook), but you also can be sued for what we call &#8216;exclusionary conduct,&#8217; for things that you&#8217;ve done that are anti-competitive.”</p>
<p>The Fitbit-wearing senator is quick to close by adding that she’s not anti-technology, per se. “I think the innovations are great. I use them all the time, even though I&#8217;ve had some hilarious online ordering experiences, including when I now have six two-pound things of maple yogurt. I mistook it and I thought they were small yogurts in my refrigerator. I think that they&#8217;re great, but I think that they can still be great with allowing from our competition, they&#8217;ll be better.”</p>
