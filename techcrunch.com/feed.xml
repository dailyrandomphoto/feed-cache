										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today introduced a suite of updates for its <a href="https://edu.google.com/">online education tools</a> whose adoption and further development have been accelerated by the pandemic, including Google Classroom, Google Meet and the next generation of G Suite for Education, now rebranded as Google Workspace for Education. In total, Google is promising more than 50 new features across its education products, with a focus on meeting educators&#8217; and admins&#8217; needs, in particular, in addition to those of the students.</p>
<p>When Google first introduced Google Classroom, it didn&#8217;t set out to create a Learning Management System (LMS), the company says. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, Google found that many educators had begun to use Classroom as the &#8220;hub&#8221; for their online learning activities. Today, the service is used by over 150 million students, teachers and school admins, up from just 40 million last year.</p>
<p>As a result of the pandemic-prompted adoption and user feedback, Google is introducing a range of new features for Classroom this year, some of which will be made available sooner than others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To better cater to those who are using Classroom as the hub for online learning, a new marketplace of Classroom &#8220;add-ons&#8221; will allow teachers later this year to select their favorite edtech tools and content and assign them directly to students, without requiring extra log-ins. Admins will also be able to install these add-ons for other teachers in their domains.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TCKRxg5cYO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/google-to-roll-out-its-digital-learning-platform-to-23-million-students-and-teachers-in-indias-maharashtra-state/">Google to roll out its digital learning platform to 23 million students and teachers in India&#8217;s Maharashtra state</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google to roll out its digital learning platform to 23 million students and teachers in India&#8217;s Maharashtra state&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/google-to-roll-out-its-digital-learning-platform-to-23-million-students-and-teachers-in-indias-maharashtra-state/embed/#?secret=TCKRxg5cYO" data-secret="TCKRxg5cYO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Also later this year, admins will be able to populate classes in advance with Student Information System (SIS) roster syncing and, for select SIS customers, students&#8217; grades from Classroom will be able to be exported directly to the SIS. Additional logging, including Classroom audit logs (to see things like student removals or who archived a class), as well as Classroom activity logs (to check on adoption and engagement) will be available soon.</p>
<p>When students attend in-person school, teachers can easily notice when a student is falling behind. A new set of Classroom tools aims to do the same for virtual learning, as well. With the new student engagement tracking feature, teachers will be able to see relevant stats about how students are interacting with Classroom, like which students submitted assignments on a given day or commented on a post, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114075" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114075" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114075" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LwG_Student-Engagement-Tracking.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114075" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Other tools will tackle the realities of working from home, where internet connections aren&#8217;t always reliable, or &#8212; for some low-income students &#8212; not available at all. With an updated Classroom Android app, students will be able to start their work offline, review assignments, open Drive attachments and write in Google Docs without an internet connection. The work will sync when a connection is again available. And when students upload assignments by taking a photo, new tools will allow students to combine photos into a single document, crop and rotate images and adjust the lighting.</p>
<p>Classroom will also gain support for rich text formatting &#8212; like bold, italics, underline and adding bullets across web, iOS and Android.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114074" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114074" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021-GDU-MET-UI-Rich-Text-Editing-in-Google-Classroom-AV-R2.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Originality reports, which help to detect plagiarism, will be available soon in 15 languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Italian, Indonesian, Japanese, Finnish, German, Korean, Danish, Malaysian and Hindi.</p>
<p>And Google&#8217;s own free, introductory computer science curriculum, CS First, is immediately available in Classroom.</p>
<p>Beyond Classroom itself, Google Meet is also being updated with the needs of educators in mind.</p>
<p>One must-have new feature, rolling out over the next few weeks, is a &#8220;mute all&#8221; button to give control of the classroom back to teachers. In April, teachers will also be able to control when a student can unmute themselves, as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114077" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114077" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2114077" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LwG_Moderator-Controls-on-Mobile.gif?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114077" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Other moderation controls will roll out this year, too, including controls over who can join meetings, chat or share their screen from their iOS and Android devices. Policies over who can join video calls will be able to be set by admins in April, as well, enabling rules around student-to-student connections across districts, professional development opportunities for teachers, external speakers visiting a class and more. Students will also not be able to join Meets generated from Classroom until their teacher has arrived. Teachers, meanwhile, will be made meeting hosts so multiple teachers can share the load of managing classes.</p>

<p>Google Meet is adding engagement and inclusivity features for students, too. Students will be able to select emoji skin tones to represent them and react in class with emoji, which teachers will be able to control.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114076" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114076" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114076" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LwG_Emoji-Reactions.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114076" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, Google&#8217;s &#8220;G Suite for Education,&#8221; which includes Classroom, Meet, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides and more, will be rebranded as Google Workspace for Education. The tools themselves, now used by 170 million students and educators globally, won&#8217;t change. But the set will be available in four editions instead of just two to better accommodate a wider variety of needs.</p>
<p>The free version will be rebranded Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals, and will remain largely the same. The paid version, meanwhile, will become available in three tiers: Google Workspace for Education Standard and Google Workspace for Education Plus, as well as the Teaching and Learning Upgrade, which can be added on to Fundamentals or Standard to provide video communication in Google Meet, and other Classroom tools, like originality reports.</p>
<p>Standard has everything in Fundamentals, in addition to enhanced security through Security Center, audit logs and advanced mobile management. Plus has everything in the three other versions, as well as advanced security and analytics, teaching and learning capabilities, and more.</p>
<p>Fundamentals and Plus are available today and the others will go live April 14, 2021. Those who already have G Suite for Enterprise for Education will be upgraded to Education Plus.</p>
<p>Related to these changes, the storage model will be updated to a new, pooled storage option that aims to better allocate storage resources across educational institutions. The new model offers schools and universities a baseline of 100 TB of pooled storage shared by all users, which goes into effect for current customers in July 2022, and will be effective for new customers in 2022. Google says less than 1% of institutions will be impacted by the updated model, whose baseline supports over 100 million documents or 8 million presentations or 400,000 hours of video, to give an idea of size.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2SNXPagkNT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">To win post-pandemic, edtech needs to start thinking big</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The company plans several updates for its Google Workspace for Education product line in the weeks to come, including saved drafts in Google Forms (in Fundamentals) Google Meet meeting transcripts (in the Teaching and Learning Upgrade) and more.</p>
<p>Outside of software product updates, Google is launching over 40 new Chromebooks, including a set of &#8220;Always Connected&#8221; branded devices that have an LTE connectivity option built in. Chrome&#8217;s screen reader, ChromeVox, has also been improved with new tutorials, the ability to search ChromeVox menus and voice switching that automatically changes the screen reader’s voice based on the language of the text.</p>
<p>Parents, who are now participating in their child&#8217;s online learning in a number of ways, will be able to add their child&#8217;s Google Workspace for Education account to their child&#8217;s personal account with Family Link &#8212; Google&#8217;s parental control software. That means kids can still log into their school apps and accounts, while parents ensure they stay focused on learning by restricting other apps and overall device usage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Chen has a pithy pitch for his new startup <a href="https://www.gettaste.com">Taste</a>: &#8220;We made the Instagram of nice food.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, just as Instagram made it easy for regular smartphone users to look like talented photographers, Taste makes it easy for customers to prepare impressive meals at home.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the real preparation is being done by fine-dining restaurants — Chen told me there are 16 Michelin-starred and Michelin-rated restaurants currently on the platform — whose food doesn&#8217;t translate easily to a delivery or takeout experience. Taste offers &#8220;dinner kits,&#8221; which Chen said are neither standard takeout (where everything has been fully prepared but doesn&#8217;t necessarily travel well) or a regular meal kit (where &#8220;everything is separate and raw&#8221;).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, he suggested Taste&#8217;s dinner kits are &#8220;this in-between thing&#8221; where the food is mostly, but not entirely, prepared in advance, allowing customers to &#8220;heat and assemble much faster.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114295" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114295" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114295" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Taste screenshot" width="680" height="661" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg 1860w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=300,292 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=768,747 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=680,661 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,1493 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114295" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Taste</p></div></p>
<p>For example, when I tried out Taste last week, my girlfriend and I received three-course meals from <a href="https://www.intersect-nyc.com">Intersect by Lexus</a> and its &#8220;restaurant in residence&#8221; The Grey. A couple of the (delicious) courses and sides had to be heated in the oven or the microwave for five, 10 or 20 minutes, but there was no real prep or cooking required — the real work was cleaning up afterward.</p>
<p>Even the packaging was impressive (if a little overwhelming), with a large, fancy box for each kit, and then individual packages for each course, plus a separate package for spices. There are optional wine pairings, and some restaurants will also provide plating instructions and a Spotify playlist for the meal.</p>
<p>Taste — which is part of the winter 2021 batch of startups at Y Combinator — is currently New York City-only, where it works with restaurants including Dirt Candy, Meadowsweet and the Musket Room. As you might expect, these kits cost more than your standard dinner delivery. Many of them are in the $60-to-$100 per person range, although there are also dinners below $40, as well as a la carte options.</p>
<p>Chen (who sold <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/24/joyride/">his last startup Joyride</a> to Google) said that he and his co-founder Daryl Sew have been excited to help New York City chefs reinvent their offerings for delivery and weather the pandemic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114300" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114300" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114300" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Taste founders Daryl Sew, Jeff Chen" width="680" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg 1278w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=768,577 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=680,511 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114300" class="wp-caption-text">Taste founders Daryl Sew and Jeff Chen. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Taste</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We also do a very key thing, which is pre-ordering and batching for the restaurant,&#8221; he added. &#8220;When a restaurant works with Taste, all the orders come in two days before to the restaurant, and we pick it up at designated times, which helps tremendously with capacity lift.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Taste might seem particularly appealing now, when indoor fine dining options are either illegal, unsafe or transformed by social distancing and mask-wearing, Chen anticipates healthy demand even after the pandemic. After all, he suggested that before COVID-19, there were many people — busy parents, for example, or people who work long hours — who felt like they couldn&#8217;t take advantage of these restaurants as often as they wanted, or at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is getting moved into the home,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Movies are getting moved into the home with Netflix, workouts are getting moved into the home with Peloton and Tonal, and now we’re going to move nice dining experiences into the home.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian Facebook users will be forced to go elsewhere to read news after the company announced Wednesday that they will be restricting users in the country from sharing or viewing news links on the platform. The drastic move follows debate on proposed legislation from the Australian government that seeks to push internet platforms &#8212; with a particular focus on advertising giants Facebook and Google &#8212; to pay news publishers directly for access to share their content.</p>
<p>Pulling back entirely was a nuclear option for Facebook which had previously floated the possibility. In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">blog post</a>, the company sought to minimize the material impact of the decision to Facebook&#8217;s bottom line, while emphasizing what the move will cost users in Australia and around the globe. The company disclosed that just 4% of the content in Australian users&#8217; feeds was news, though the platform did not break out other engagement metrics tied to news consumption.</p>
<p>In their post, Facebook sought to drive a distinction between how news content was shared on Facebook by users while content is algorithmically curated by Google inside their search product. &#8220;Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content,&#8221; William Easton, Facebook&#8217;s managing director for the region, wrote. &#8220;On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google has already begun working with publishers to drive lump sum payments so that they continue to surface news content in the country, striking a deal Wednesday with Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp, despite their own earlier threats to shut down in Australia. Facebook&#8217;s action has ramifications for global users outside Australia who will be unable to share links on the platform to news publications based in the country.</p>
<p>This legislation is an aggressive example of regional legislation having the potential to drive global change for how internet platforms continue to operate. It&#8217;s clear that plenty of other countries are watching this saga play out. Facebook taking a hard line approach while Google seeks to strike private deals to stay active showcases different approaches from very different platforms being forced to reckon with how they operate in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security lapse by a Jamaican government contractor has exposed immigration records and COVID-19 test results for hundreds of thousands of travelers who visited the island over the past year.</p>
<p>The Jamaican government contracted Amber Group to build the <a href="https://jamcovid19.moh.gov.jm/">JamCOVID19 website</a> and app, which the government uses to publish daily coronavirus figures and allows residents to self-report their symptoms. The contractor also built the website to pre-approve travel applications to visit the island during the pandemic, a process that requires travelers to upload a negative COVID-19 test result before they board their flight if they come from high-risk countries, including the United States.</p>
<p>But a cloud storage server storing those uploaded documents was left unprotected and without a password, and was publicly spilling out files onto the open web.</p>
<p>Many of the victims whose information was found on the exposed server are Americans.</p>
<p>The data is now secure after TechCrunch contacted Amber Group&#8217;s chief executive Dushyant Savadia, who did not comment when reached prior to publication.</p>
<p>The storage server, hosted on Amazon Web Services, was set to public. It&#8217;s not known for how long the data was unprotected, but contained more than 70,000 negative COVID-19 lab results, over 425,000 immigration documents authorizing travel to the island — which included the traveler&#8217;s name, date of birth and passport numbers — and over 250,000 quarantine orders dating back to June 2020, when Jamaica reopened its borders to visitors after the pandemic&#8217;s first wave. The server also contained more than 440,000 images of travelers&#8217; signatures.</p>
<p>Two U.S. travelers whose lab results were among the exposed data told TechCrunch that they uploaded their COVID-19 results through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210215095341/https://www.visitjamaica.com/travelauthorization/">the Visit Jamaica website</a> before their travel. Once lab results are processed, travelers receive a travel authorization that they must present before boarding their flight.</p>
<p>Both of these documents, as well as quarantine orders that require visitors to shelter in place and several passports, were on the exposed storage server.</p>
<p>Travelers who are staying outside Jamaica&#8217;s so-called &#8220;resilient corridor,&#8221; a zone that covers a large portion of the island&#8217;s population, are told to install the app built by Amber Group that tracks their location and is tracked by the Ministry of Health to ensure visitors stay within the corridor. The app also requires that travelers record short &#8220;check-in&#8221; videos with a daily code sent by the government, along with their name and any symptoms.</p>
<p>The server exposed more than 1.1 million of those daily updating check-in videos.</p>

Travelers may be required to install the JamCOVID19 app to allow the government to monitor their location and to require video check-ins. (Image: Jamaican government)</p></div></p>
<p>The server also contained dozens of daily timestamped spreadsheets named &#8220;PICA,&#8221; likely for the Jamaican passport, immigration and citizenship agency, but these were restricted by access permissions. But the permissions on the storage server were set so that anyone had full control of the files inside, such as allowing them to be downloaded or deleted altogether. (TechCrunch did neither, as doing so would be unlawful.)</p>
<p>Stephen Davidson, a spokesperson for the Jamaican Ministry of Health, did not comment when reached, or say if the government planned to inform travelers of the security lapse.</p>
<p>Savadia founded Amber Group in 2015 and soon launched its vehicle-tracking system, Amber Connect.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20201030/amber-enters-four-more-markets-pandemic-tech">one report</a>, Amber&#8217;s Savadia said the company developed JamCOVID19 &#8220;within three days&#8221; and made it available to the Jamaican government in large part for free. The contractor is billing other countries, including Grenada and the British Virgin Islands, for similar implementations, and is said to be looking for other government customers outside the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Savadia would not say what measures his company put in place to protect the data of paying governments.</p>
<p>Jamaica has recorded at least 19,300 coronavirus cases on the island to date, and more than 370 deaths.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you&#8217;re just starting out building your company, there&#8217;s obviously a lot that can go wrong. Especially if you&#8217;re a first-time founder (but even if you&#8217;re an experienced serial entrepreneur), it can be hard to spot the potential pitfalls that might lead you astray before you even really get rolling. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re thrilled to have Fuel Capital General Partner Leah Solivan joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=fuelcapitalpost">TechCrunch Early Stage — Operations and Fundraising</a> on April 1 and 2 for a discussion about how to avoid making some of the biggest mistakes early in your founding journey.</p>
<p>Solivan brings her keen insight as an early-stage investor who has invested in and helped many early-stage companies spanning consumer tech, marketplaces, hardware and retail &#8212; but also her eight years of experience leading TaskRabbit, the startup she founded and led to a successful exit when it was acquired by IKEA in 2017. Between her time as an operator building a successful business and raising more than $50 million in venture funding, and her nearly four years investing and helping other founders build companies with Fuel, Solivan has unparalleled perspective on how to avoid common company-building problems early on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Atlanta area is getting a new incubator for startups working with 5G technology courtesy of T-Mobile and Georgia Tech&#8217;s Advanced Technology Development Center, <a href="https://innovate.gatech.edu/news/tmobile-georgia-tech-curiosity-lab-team-fuel-5g-innovation-drones-autonomous-vehicles-robotics/">the companies announced today</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an expansion of the T-Mobile Accelerator program and part of the big carrier&#8217;s efforts to boost 5G innovation.</p>
<p>Located in the Atlanta adjacent exurb of Peachtree Corners&#8217; technology development park, which is already equipped with T-Mobile&#8217;s 5G services, <a href="https://atdc.org/application-for-the-5g-connected-future-incubator-at-curiosity-lab-at-peachtree-corners/">the incubator will help developers build and test 5G use cases</a> including autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial drone applications, mixed reality training and entertainment, remote medical care and personal health, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Startups working with the 5G Connected Future program will work directly with folks at T-Mobile&#8217;s accelerator, Georgia Tech, and Curiosity Lab, an initiative in the Peachtree Corners campus.</p>
<p>“In addition to the normal startup concerns, entrepreneurs in the 5G space face a unique set of challenges such as regulatory issues at the state and local levels, network security, and integration testing,” said ATDC Director John Avery.</p>
<p>Peachtree Corners&#8217; setup may help folks navigate that roll out. As part of its involvement ATDC will offer programing, recruit and evaluate startups, and hire staff to manage the vertical in Peachtree Corners, the organization said.</p>
<p>“This collaboration is a great opportunity for ATDC and Georgia Tech, the city of Peachtree Corners and Curiosity Lab, and T-Mobile, a Fortune 50 company, to create a unique collection to work with these companies, refine their ideas into scalable companies, and bring these solutions to market more quickly,” Avery said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such a partnership underscores “Georgia Tech’s commitment to enabling tomorrow’s technology leaders, which remains as strong as when ATDC was founded 41 years ago,” said Chaouki T. Abdallah, Georgia Tech’s executive vice president for research. “Innovation cannot take place in a vacuum, which is why entrepreneurs and startups require the knowledge and resources provided through partnerships such as ours.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Massachusetts-based Locus Robotics today announced a $150 million Series E. The round, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">led by Tiger Global Management and Bond, </span>brings the firm’s total to around $250 to date, and values the robotics company at $1 billion. Locus is notable for a more modular and flexible solution for automating warehouses than many of its competitors (see: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/as-retail-robotics-heats-up-berkshire-grey-raises-263m/">Berkshire Grey</a>). The company essentially leases out robotic fleet for organizes looking to automate logistics.</p>
<p>“We can change the wings on the plane while it’s flying,” CEO Rick Faulk tells TechCrunch. Basically no one else can do that. Companies want flexible automation. They don’t want to bolt anything to the floor. If you’re a third-party logistics company and you have a two, three, four-year contract, the last thing you want to do is invest $25-$50 million to buy a massive solution, bolt it to the floor and be locked into all of this upfront expense.”</p>
<p>The company currently has some 4,000 robots deployed across 80 sites. Roughly 80% of its deployments are in the U.S., with the remaining 20% in Europe. Part of this massive funding round will go toward expanding international operations, including a bigger push into the EU, as well as the APAC region, where it presently doesn’t have much of a footprint.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company will also be investing in R&amp;D, sales and marketing and increasing its current headcount of 165 by 75 in the coming year.</p>
<p>The pandemic is clearly a driver in interest around this brand of automation, with more companies looking toward robotics for help.</p>
<p>“COVID has put a spike in the growth of online ordering, clearly, and that spike is probably a four to five year jump,” says Faulk. &#8220;If you look at the trend of e-commerce, it’s been on a steady upward tick. It was about 11% last year and COVID put a spike up to 16/17%. We think that genie’s out of the bottle, and it’s not going back any time soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding round also points to a company that seemingly has no desire to be acquired by a larger name, akin to Kiva Systems’ transformation into Amazon Robotics.</p>
<p>“We have no interest in being acquired,” the CEO says. “We think we can build the most and greatest value by operating independently. There are investors that want to invest in helping everyone that’s not named ‘Amazon’ compete.”</p>

Just look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">this speaker lineup</a>. As always, we’ll have ample time for networking so you can connect and discover new people and new opportunities to change the world.</p>
<p>We believe accessibility and inclusion starts at home, which is why you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">get a TC Sessions: Justice pass</a> for $5. Here are just a few of the outstanding presentations on tap — be sure to read the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">TC Sessions: Justice 2021 agenda</a>. We have a few surprises and more speakers in store, so check back in the coming weeks to see what’s new.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Meeting of the Minds:</strong> Diversity and inclusion as an idea has been on the agenda of tech companies for years now. But the industry still lacks true inclusion, despite best efforts put forth by heads of diversity, equity and inclusion at these companies. We’ll seek to better understand what’s standing in the way of progress and what it’s going to take to achieve real change. Wade Davis (Netflix), Bo Young Lee (Uber).</p>
<p><strong>Identifying and Dismantling Tech&#8217;s Deep Systems of Bias:</strong> Nearly every popular technology or service has within it systems of bias or exclusion, ignored by the privileged but obvious to the groups affected. How should these systems be exposed and documented, and how can we set about eliminating them and preventing more from appearing in the future? Mutale Nkonde (AI for the People), Haben Girma (disability rights lawyer) and Safiya Umoja Noble (author of “Algorithms of Oppression”).</p>
<p><strong>Demystifying First-Check Fundraising with First-Check Investors:</strong> There are so many ways to finance your startup that don’t include Y combinator or a traditional fund. In this stacked panel, founders will hear how to leverage unconventional communities and resources to get the first dollars they need to execute. Brian Brackeen (Lightship Capital), Astrid Scholz (Zebras Unite), Sydney Thomas (Precursor Ventures).</p>
<p>You’ll also get to meet some of the diverse early-stage startup founders participating in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/include/">TechCrunch Include</a> program and watch them deliver their best pitch in a live feedback session.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a> takes place on March 3. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">Buy your pass</a> and spend the day listening to and learning from the people leading the charge for meaningful change in tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gravysolutions.io/">Gravy</a>, a startup helping subscription-based businesses recover failed payments, has raised $4.5 million in Series A funding for its specialized combination of technology and a human workspace that works to reacquire customers lost to what&#8217;s known as &#8220;involuntary churn.&#8221; That means the customer didn&#8217;t choose to end their subscription, but &#8212; for any one of hundreds of possible reasons &#8212; their credit card payment failed.</p>
<p>Typically, subscription-powered businesses attempt to correct this issue with technology &#8212; like sending automated emails, for example. Gravy, however, has developed a different solution that pairs its U.S.-based retention specialists with technology that alerts them to the failed payments. It then sells this whole system as a package to clients who use Gravy as an extension of their own workforce.</p>
<p>The new funding round &#8212; Gravy&#8217;s first institutional money &#8212; was led by Birmingham-based Arlington Family Partners, one of the few family offices in the southeast. It&#8217;s also one with a personal connection to Gravy co-founders, CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseygraham1/">Casey Graham</a> and Chief of Staff, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneeweber1/">Renee Weber</a>, as it managed their earnings from a prior acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gravy, in fact, actually got its start at that earlier business, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rocket-company/about/">The Rocket Company,</a> a coaching and resource provider for churches, which exited to a private equity group, <a href="https://www.ministrybrands.com/our-brands/">Ministry Brands</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spent two years fixing [the problem of failed payments] in the last company and created a tech-enabled solution where we leveraged actual human beings to win back failed payments for subscriptions. And by doing that, we got a 5x offer higher than the initial offer because we fixed the failed payment problem,&#8221; Graham notes.</p>
<p>He first assumed other subscription businesses were doing the same, but later discovered that many were not. Instead, they tended to use automated means to address the problem, which would only recoup about 15% to 20% of the failed payments.</p>
<p>These tech-only solutions don&#8217;t work as well because customers often dismiss automated emails from companies, Graham says. However, customers do respond to personal outreach &#8212; but that&#8217;s something many new and fast-growing businesses can&#8217;t afford as they&#8217;re investing more heavily in growth and scale.</p>
<p>Gravy offers them a middle ground between automation and hiring in-house. Companies contract with Gravy <a href="https://www.gravysolutions.io/price">on a subscription basis</a> by paying a flat fee, tiered based upon transaction volume. This fee ranges from $997 on the low end to $8,000 on the high end. Gravy then integrates with the client&#8217;s own payment products and processor, their subscription manager and any other solutions they may use for managing subscriptions &#8212; like Stripe, Braintree, Recurly, Keap (Infusionsoft) and <a href="https://www.gravysolutions.io/what-gravy-does">others</a>. It even sets up a Gravy channel on the company&#8217;s Slack in order to better communicate with company staff.</p>
<p>The end result is that Gravy&#8217;s team feels like a part of the business itself, not some contract workforce.</p>
<p>Once established, Gravy&#8217;s team will use email and text, per the client&#8217;s preferences, to personally reach out to customers with failed payments to try to get their card information updated. Because it&#8217;s operating closely with the client, the specialists can also offer things like &#8220;stay bonuses&#8221; and other deals that could help bring back a customer who may not have otherwise bothered to return. During COVID, for example, Gravy also offered additional options, like the ability for the customer to skip several months along with other more personalized options to meet the customer&#8217;s specific needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we&#8217;re onboarding [a client], we create an empathetic script of three different responses, or opportunities for us to negotiate with the customer to win that customer back,&#8221; Graham explains. This works because of the human component &#8212; people know when they&#8217;re talking to a real person and not an automated script, he says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114195" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114195" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114195" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="409" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114195" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gravy</p></div></p>
<p>Since its founding in 2017, Gravy has scaled to over 300 clients, whose businesses may be as small as $200,000-$250,000 in revenue up to $100 million in annual revenue from subscriptions. These clients either operate in the B2B space &#8212; like B2B content subscriptions or tech education and certification, for example &#8212; or in the B2C space. In particular, Gravy is leveraged by a number of &#8220;box&#8221; subscription services (which offer to ship a box of products to a customer&#8217;s home) and B2C education and online courses.</p>
<p>To date, Gravy has processed over 6 million failed payments and has won back $175 million in failed payment subscriptions. The company is now on a mission to return $1 billion in failed payments by 2023. Gravy is also expected to pass $1 million in MRR this year, Graham says.</p>
<p>Notably, Gravy&#8217;s retention specialists aren&#8217;t &#8220;gig workers&#8221; or contractors &#8212; they&#8217;re full-time employees with benefits. And they can be employed from anywhere, which Graham says is a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Though technically an Atlanta-area startup, Graham and Weber live 50 miles north of downtown Atlanta.</p>
<p>&#8220;I live on a farm, and we were told we were at a disadvantage because we weren&#8217;t in the middle of the Atlanta tech scene,&#8221; Graham says. &#8220;But the reality is, it became a huge advantage for us because our strategy has been to recruit the best people in small towns across the United States. Besides, he adds, &#8220;Slack is our headquarters.&#8221;</p>
<p>This strategy has allowed Gravy to also employ several military family members, who often have a hard time finding consistent work because they have to move regularly. That leads them to often take gig work instead of full-time jobs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114196" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114196" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114196" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg 7776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114196" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gravy</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The gig economy &#8212; those companies are not committed to those people. They don&#8217;t care about them, or if they work or not. It&#8217;s a gig,&#8221; Graham says. &#8220;Gravy is committed to them on salaries, benefits … that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re super proud of.&#8221; He says Gravy&#8217;s salaries start at $55,000.</p>
<p>With the new funding, Gravy plans to expand its team of 83 to about 150 by year-end, expand its client acquisition efforts and further invest into its product. Longer term, he believes Gravy could also help businesses with other needs, including voluntary churn, for starters, and even customer service and customer success in the future.</p>

Having previously worked inside Bay Area startups, she has a deep understanding of the pressing issues facing the businesses of tomorrow.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution to the world’s climate change problems could be under our feet, as soil has the potential to store more than </span><a href="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/02/21/can-soil-help-combat-climate-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the amount of carbon in the atmosphere But about </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00008/full"><span style="font-weight: 400;">45% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the Earth’s soil is used for agriculture, and most farmland has lost up to 30% of its carbon from unsustainable land management practices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To turn agricultural land into a thriving carbon sink, farmers need to be able to manage it by shifting to regenerative agriculture practices like reducing tillage, planting cover crops and increasing crop rotations and biodiversity. But you can’t manage something until you can measure it, and that’s where </span><a href="http://useyardstick.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yard Stick </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">comes in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Soil sequestration can be a really powerful carbon removal technology,” said Chris Tolles, CEO of Yard Stick. “But only if we’ve got really high-quality science and technology helping us measure it.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantifying regenerative agriculture is a challenge, and measuring soil carbon is no exception. The traditional method, dry combustion, requires a lot of leg work. Scientists trudge across acres of land digging up soil samples and mail them thousands of miles to a lab where another scientist burns the soil to calculate the carbon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is not scalable for obvious reasons,” Tolles said. “We need a measurement technology that can release that bottleneck.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yard Stick hopes to be that technology &#8212; a hand-held soil probe to measure carbon soil levels onsite. The Massachusetts-based startup was founded out of the </span><a href="https://soilhealthinstitute.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soil Health Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using a $3.25 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy’s </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/soil-health-institute-awarded-3-25-million-from-arpa-e-to-develop-soil-carbon-measurement-and-monitoring-system-301124040.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program. This funding exists to specifically help pro-social technology solutions come to market.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four soil experts &#8212; Dr. Christine Morgan, chief scientific officer of the Soil Health Institute; Kevin Meissner, a mechanical/electrical engineer who was previously the co-founder/CTO of carbon removal startup Charm Industrial; associate professor at the University of Nebraska, Yufeng Ge; and Alex McBratney from the University of Sydney &#8212; combined their research and expertise to create a probe that uses spectral analysis, resistance sensors, machine learning and agricultural statistics to measure and calculate the amount of carbon in an area of soil. Tolles is tasked with bringing the product out of the academic world and into the commercial market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The probe is attached to a hand-held drill. The small camera on its tip is tuned to capture the specific wavelengths reflected off of organic carbon using VisNIR spectrometry. Resistance sensors use the force needed to drill the probe into the ground to calculate the density of the soil. With those two inputs, plus a few complicated algorithms and statistical analyses, Yard Stick can calculate the amount of carbon in the ground without ever digging up a sample and mailing it to a lab to be burned.</span></p>

Number two, the cost is dramatically lower,” Tolles said. “And what that means, three, you’ll get a more accurate measurement of your carbon stock because our technology is so much cheaper and easier, that you can dramatically increase your sampling density.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yard Stick is currently working with a few large food companies engaged in regenerative agriculture pilot programs with farms across the United States. Yard Stick doesn’t plan to sell directly to farms. Instead, it works with project developers like these companies. Yard Stick is using these connections to verify its probe is as reliable as the traditional gold standard of carbon soil measuring and to introduce its product and service to farmers. Yard Stick plans to sell a data measurement service, not the hardware itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of our customers want to own a spectrometer,” Tolles said. “They don’t know what to do with one even if we made it idiot simple.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yard Stick sends its people out to take the measurements and then provides reports to farmers and other stakeholders that put the data in context, charging per acre. At some point Tolles hopes the device will be simple enough that anyone with a bit of training can use the probe so the number of Yard Stick employees isn’t a rate-limiting factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2022, Yard Stick hopes to be measuring 200,000 acres using a few thousand probes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more data and just as importantly more data sharing, we can begin to turn the ship around on climate change. But data is a sensitive business to be in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to acknowledge the limitations of late-stage capitalist worldviews, which don’t often incentivize sharing,” Tolles said. “There’s a real tragic risk here that the information is so valuable that everybody wants to keep it to themselves and the benefits of soil carbon marketplaces only accrue to the same giant industrial agricultural corporations that have had it for so long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few other early-stage companies are also trying to bust open the market for soil carbon, including </span><a href="https://www.laserag.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaserAg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which works in laboratories instead of in the fields, and </span><a href="https://www.cloudagronomics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CloudAgronomics</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which uses satellites for remote measurement of soil health. But Yard Stick’s main competitor is every farm out there that isn’t measuring and managing their carbon stores, which, according to Tolles, is 99.9% of farms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mission is to avoid catastrophic climate change,” Tolles said. “So I think we’re inclined to be very pro-competitor.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blockchain.com">Blockchain.com</a> has announced that it has <a href="https://medium.com/blockchain/blockchain-com-raised-120m-strategic-growth-round-led-by-macro-investors-84488f4a0913">raised</a> a $120 million funding round. The company develops a popular cryptocurrency wallet as well as an exchange, an explorer and more.</p>
<p>Moore Strategic Ventures, Kyle Bass, Access Industries, Rovida Advisors, Lightspeed Venture Partners, GV, Lakestar, Eldridge and other unnamed investors participated in today’s funding round. Overall, the company has raised more than $190 million since its creation.</p>
<p>Originally named Blockchain.info, the company started off as a blockchain explorer. An explorer lets you enter the hash of any transaction that occurs on the bitcoin blockchain to get more information about the amount, fees, number of confirmations as well as the wallet addresses of the sender and the receiver. Over time, explorers started adding support for more blockchains and more types of data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blockchain.com then built an open-source bitcoin wallet — it now supports more cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. The company’s wallet is a noncustodial wallet, which means that you’re in control of your private keys. Other noncustodial wallets include <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com">Coinbase Wallet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/buzzy-ethereum-wallet-app-argent-comes-out-of-stealth/">Argent</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/zengo-wants-to-become-the-crypto-wallet-for-the-masses/">ZenGo</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Many crypto users choose to buy bitcoins on an exchange and leave them on the exchange account. In that case, you don’t control the wallet as the exchange takes care of keeping your crypto assets safe for you. Custodial wallets include <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase.com</a>, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com">Kraken</a>, etc.</p>
<p>There are some advantages and disadvantages with each solution. If an exchange gets hacked or somebody gets your login information through phishing, your assets aren’t safe on a custodial wallet.</p>
<p>If you lose your private key, you can’t access your noncustodial wallet. Blockchain.com and other noncustodial wallet providers have found ways to mitigate the risk of losing access to your wallet by backing up some information.</p>
<p>More recently, Blockchain.com has launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/blockchain-the-company-launches-an-exchange-the-pit/">its own exchange</a> so that wallet users can trade assets more easily. It now also offers services to <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/institutional">institutional investors</a> so that they can get started with cryptocurrencies. Services include order executions, custody, lending, OTC transactions, etc.</p>
<p>Blockchain.com has also shared some metrics. People have created 65 million wallets on the company’s website or using the mobile apps. Since 2012, 28% of bitcoin transactions have been sent or received by a Blockchain.com-managed wallet.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>My fiancé is in the U.S. on an H-1B visa, which is set to expire in about a year and a half. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We were originally planning to marry last year, but both he and I want to have a ceremony and party with our families and friends, so we decided to hold off until the pandemic ends. I’m a U.S. citizen and plan to sponsor my fiancé for a green card. </strong></p>
<p><strong>How long does it typically take to get a green card for a spouse? Any tips you can share?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Sweetheart in San Francisco</strong></p>
<p>Dear Sweetheart:</p>
<p>Congratulations! It’s so wonderful to hear you’re planning to take the next step with your beloved. I understand wanting to wait to have a big wedding and party. However, to avoid the risk that your husband-to-be will have to leave the U.S., I recommend that you get married in a civil ceremony as soon as possible and immediately file for a green card.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/058-engaged-now-what/">podcast</a> that my law partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anitakoumriqian/">Anita Koumriqian</a> and I posted on the ins and outs of applying for a fiancé visa (if your fiancé is living outside of the U.S.) or a marriage-based green card.</p>
<p>If your husband has already been sponsored for a green card by his employer and he’s only waiting for his priority date to become current, his employer might be able to renew his H-1B visa beyond six years, which would mean he won’t have to leave the U.S. while he waits for either green card to come through. Keep in mind that due to COVID-19 restrictions and an increase in filings, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is facing significant delays in processing all immigration cases. Currently, USCIS may take more than a year to process <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/marriage-based-green-cards/">marriage-based green card</a> petitions.</p>
<p>To answer your second question, here are my tips for getting a marriage-based green card for your soon-to-be husband:</p>
<h2>Ask for employer support</h2>
<p>Given that your fiancé’s employer could benefit by retaining him without going through (or needing to complete) the lengthier and more costly process for an employer-sponsored green card, your fiancé should ask his company to cover the legal and filing costs for the marriage-based green card. Your fiancé’s employer will also probably still have to submit an H-1B visa renewal on his behalf.</p>
<p>For a good-faith marriage, marriage-based green cards generally are quicker, less document-intensive and less expensive than getting an employer-sponsored green card. If your fiancé is from India or China, he would face a substantially longer wait for an employee-based green card due to the annual numerical and per-country caps.</p>
<p>There are no numerical or per-country caps on marriage-based green cards for immediate relatives. Because of this, you will be able to file <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-130">Form I-130</a> (Petition for Alien Relative), which establishes your relationship to your spouse, and <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-485">Form I-485</a> (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) for the green card at the same time (concurrent filing).</p>

<h2>Hire an immigration attorney</h2>
<p>Filing a petition to sponsor a spouse for a green card sounds straightforward, but it requires more than just filling out the appropriate forms. Many couples come to us after going it alone and running into problems or getting denied.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.boldstart.vc/">Boldstart Ventures</a>, a New York-based firm that started with a $1 million proof-of-concept fund in 2011, has just closed on $155 million in capital commitments for its fifth flagship fund and $75 million for its second opportunity fund, a vehicle meant to support breakout startups in its portfolio.</p>
<p>Given Boldstart&#8217;s focus &#8212; and its track record to date &#8212; it&#8217;s only surprising that the young firm didn&#8217;t raise more in the current market. From the outset, Boldstart has focused on technical founders in the U.S., Canada, and Europe who are already building, or are capable of building, &#8220;developer first&#8221; and SaaS products. Indeed, firm cofounder Ed Sim says the firm prides itself on &#8220;talking to founders before they even start their businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>He points to some of the most valuable companies in the firm&#8217;s portfolio as outfits that Boldstart funded when they &#8220;just had slide decks and no product.&#8221; Among these is <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk,</a> a company that helps developers use open source code and stay secure and was valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/snyk-bags-another-200m-at-2-6b-valuation-9-months-after-last-raise/">$2.6 billion</a> when it raised its last round of funding in September. Another is Kustomer, a startup that specializes in customer-service platforms and chatbots and that Facebook acquired in November for a reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/">$1 billion</a>. Boldstart was also there at the start of the data intelligence platform <a href="https://bigid.com/">BigID</a>, which closed its newest round in December at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bigid-keeps-rolling-with-70m-series-d-on-1b-valuation/">$1 billion valuation</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked with Sim about making those early bets &#8212; and whether capturing founders so early on in their trajectory has grown harder as more and more VCs have begun pushing into the same types of deals.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve been investing in enterprise software for more than 20 years, so many founders know you are. How much of your deal flow is inbound versus Boldstart seeing an underserved opportunity and tapping someone on the shoulder to start a company?</strong></p>
<p>ES: It&#8217;s a combination of the two. Frankly, when we started in 2010, no one knew who Boldstart was, and no one really knew who we were five years ago. Over the last couple years, because our founders have been doing so well, people have kind of learned about us a little bit more [but] by no means are we really out there.</p>
<p>I think [part of our success ties to] around 75% of our investment opportunities coming from our existing founders &#8212; they are sharing their friends with us. They are introducing us to the VP of engineering who is leaving their company and has this bug where they want to start a company. Being able to track these people before they start their business is probably one of the most important things that we can do, no matter how we meet them.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So much of a startup&#8217;s success centers on its ability to tell a story. Is it a challenge for technical founders to do this, in your experience? Is part of your job helping them find a cofounder who can sell that vision?</strong></p>
<p>ES: You&#8217;re right that the ability to tell a story is so important in order to recruit that first hire, recruit your cofounder, get us investors excited, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s been a problem [with technical founders]. It&#8217;s amazing, the amount of content that&#8217;s out there and the learnings from a lot of these VPs of engineering or heads of product [that founders absorb].</p>
<p>[Also] we really want to help them become CEOs of the world&#8217;s best enterprise companies, and that means having the patience and the understanding and providing the coaching and mentorship [they need], and even surrounding them from the very beginning with advisors or angel investors who have been there and done that. These are people from the Datadogs or the Figmas of the world who might want to write a small check . .  and help the founders and share their knowledge. To bring in that village together from the very beginning and help a technical founder learn how to be a CEO is a fun and challenging endeavor that we like to take on.</p>
<p><strong> TC: A lot of VCs have like flooded into enterprise investing in a more aggressive way. Are you having to write bigger checks, are you able to get the ownership percentage you used to get, and is it harder to maintain your pro rata?</strong></p>
<p>ES: We are getting the target ownership that we&#8217;re looking for. We are able to earn our pro rata or super pro rata in a lot of situations. And finally, I would say that it&#8217;s been nice, in a way, that a lot of these larger firms are entering the enterprise space because there&#8217;s now plenty of funding from smart people for the founders who we back at the very beginning. . .</p>
<p>If you look at the portfolio, I&#8217;d say that 75% or more of our companies end up graduating to [up] rounds, and that&#8217;s been allowing us to work with new founders who are allowing us to write the checks that we want, because they know that we will spend the time and deliver value to them.</p>
<p><strong>TC:  As these startups close funding rounds, sometimes just a few months after the last, has it become harder to retain employees? Are they hopping around more or less in this market?</strong></p>
<p>ES: Access to capital is not as hard as it used to be, but access to talent is. People will say, &#8216;Well, you can hire people remotely.&#8217; Well, yes, you can. But that means that now your competition is global.</p>
<p>With all the capital flowing, the biggest challenge for any company in hiring and accessing talent is building that engine and that culture, which are absolutely mission critical in order to build a world-class business. Those are the things that separate companies that scale quickly and companies that don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not just the product; you need great people, and you need to think about this from day one. It&#8217;s also why it&#8217;s so important for us to help founders think about what&#8217;s next, what&#8217;s six months ahead or 12 months ahead, and help them figure how to build that engine from the start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As gaming has grown from niche to mainstream over the past decades, it has also become both much more, and much less accessible to people with disabilities or other considerations. Microsoft aims to make the PC and Xbox more inclusive with a new in-house testing service that compares games to the newly expanded <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/guidelines">Xbox Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Game Accessibility Testing Service, as it&#8217;s called, is live now and anyone releasing a game on Windows or an Xbox platform can take advantage of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Games are tested against the Xbox Accessibility Guidelines by a team of subject matter experts and gamers with disabilities. Our goal is to provide accurate and timely feedback, turned around within 7 business days,&#8221; said Brannon Zahand, senior gaming accessibility program manager at the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not free (though Microsoft did not specify costs, which probably differ depending on the project), so if you want to know what the reports look like without diving in cash in hand, talk to your account rep and they can probably hook you up with a sample. But you don&#8217;t need final code to send it in.</p>
<p>&#8220;As game accessibility is much easier to implement early in a game’s development, we encourage game developers to submit as soon as they have a representative build that incorporates core UI and game experiences,&#8221; said Zahand. &#8220;That said, developers who already have released their products and are keeping them fresh with new updates and content may also find this testing valuable, as often there are relatively small tweaks or feature additions that can be made as part of a content update that will provide benefits for gamers with disabilities and others who take advantage of accessibility features.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guidelines themselves were introduced in January of last year, and include hundreds of tips and checks to include or consider when developing a game. Microsoft has done the right thing by continuing to support and revise the guidelines; The &#8220;2.0&#8221; version published today brings a number of improvements, summarized in <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/02/16/xbox-accessibility-guidelines-and-testing/">this Xbox blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking the changes are about clarity and ease of application, giving developers more direct and simple advice, but there are also now many examples from published games showing that yes, this stuff is not just theoretically possible.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113825" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/forza-difficulty2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113825" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2113825 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/forza-difficulty2.png" alt="Image of an options screen for a Forza racing game where many aspects of the game have their own difficulty setting." width="1024" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/forza-difficulty2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/forza-difficulty2.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/forza-difficulty2.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/forza-difficulty2.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/forza-difficulty2.png?resize=680,374 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/forza-difficulty2.png?resize=1536,845 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/forza-difficulty2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113825" class="wp-caption-text">Seems obvious to do this now. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Everything from the UI to control methods and difficulty settings is in there, and they actually make for compelling reading for any interested gamer. Once you see how some games have created granular difficulty settings or included features or modes to improve access without affecting the core of the game, you start to wonder why they aren&#8217;t everywhere.</p>
<p>There are also more nuts and bolts tips, such as how best to structure a menu screen or in-game UI so that a screen reader can access the information.</p>
<p>Some argue that adding or subtracting some features can interfere with the way a game is &#8220;meant&#8221; to be played. And indeed one does struggle to imagine how famously difficult and obtuse games like the Dark Souls series could integrate such changes gracefully. But for one thing, that is a consideration for very smart developers to work out on their end, and for another, these options of which we speak are almost all able to be toggled or adjusted, as indeed many things can be even in the most hardcore titles. And that&#8217;s without speaking to the lack of consideration for others in different circumstances evinced in such a sentiment.</p>
<p>Microsoft has made several moves towards accessibility in gaming in recent years, the most prominent of which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/17/microsofts-xbox-adaptive-controller-is-an-inspiring-example-of-inclusive-design/">must be the Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>, which lets people plug in all manner of assistive devices to work as joysticks, buttons, and triggers — making it much easier for much wider spectrum of people to play games on the company&#8217;s platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has raised a fresh round of funding, totalling $850 million, per a new report by CNBC, citing sources &#8220;familiar&#8221; with the matter. The new capital brings the total valuation of the company, which is still privately held, to around $74 billion according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/16/elon-musks-spacex-raised-850-million-at-419point99-a-share.html">the report</a>.</p>
<p>This is a massive round by most standards — but not by SpaceX&#8217;s own. The space launch company, which was founded in 2002, has raised over $6 billion to date including this latest injection, with a $2 billion venture round raised last August. That funding was invested at a valuation of $46 billion, meaning the company&#8217;s value, at least in the eyes of private investors, leapt considerably in the six months separating the two raises.</p>
<p>SpaceX has accomplished a lot between now and then, including building its Starlink broadband constellation to more than 1,000 active satellites; launching its first operational NASA crew to the International Space Station aboard a Dragon spacecraft; launching not one, but two high-altitude flight tests of its Starship spacecraft with relatively good results; and launched its first dedicated rideshare mission, demonstrating the viability of a big potential new group of launch customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the company has achieved a lot on the back of its existing capital, its recent successes no doubt provided a good base to go out and get more. That&#8217;s likely going to go to good use, since it has plenty of work yet to do, like continued develop of Starship to prove its space-worthiness, and the capital-intensive activity of building Starlink into a true, globe-spanning network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford today announced a new strategy for the European market that aims the automaker at primarily only selling electric vehicles by 2030. To do so, Ford intends to spend $1 billion to revamp a factory in Cologne, Germany, where it will produce EVs using a Volkswagen platform. The first production vehicle from the updated factory is expected by 2023.</p>
<p>Stuart Rowley, president of Ford of Europe, made the announcement today during an online news conference.</p>
<p>This new strategy involves phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles in favor of electric power. The automaker expects to have all commercial vehicles made by Ford in Europe be electric by 2024. Two years later, it expects to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plug-in hybrids. Gasoline-powered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in Europe after 2030, Ford says. However, the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for two-thirds of its European sales.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ford’s announcement comes after a similar pledge from General Motors where the automaker said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/gm-pledges-to-be-carbon-neutral-by-2040-with-zero-tailpipe-emission-vehicles-by-2035/">it intended to mostly produce EVs by 2035</a>. Both Ford and General Motors are small players in the European market where GM has all but pulled out, and Ford only has a 5% market share.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An influential India trader group that represents tens of millions of brick-and-mortar retailers called New Delhi to ban Amazon in the country after a report claimed that the American e-commerce group had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers in India, publicly misrepresented its ties with those sellers, and used them to circumvent foreign investment rules in the country.</p>
<p>The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Wednesday “demanded” serious action from the Indian government against Amazon following <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation/">revelations made in a Reuters story</a>. “For years, CAIT has been maintaining that Amazon has been circumventing FDI [Foreign Direct Investment] laws of India to conduct unfair and unethical trade,” it said.</p>
<p>Praveen Khandelwal, Secretary General of CAIT, which claims to represent 80 million retailers and 40,000 trade associations in India, said, “It’s an open and shut case that Amazon is wilfully playing with rules. What more we are waiting for. It should be banned in India with immediate effect.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CAIT has for years expressed concerns over what they allege are unlawful business practices employed by Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart in the country. They say these actions are posing existential threats to small merchants.</p>
<p>India is a key overseas market for Amazon, which has committed to invest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">over $6.5 billion in its operations</a> in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said the company cannot confirm the veracity or otherwise information and claims made in the Reuters story as it has not seen the documents. “The article appears to be based on unsubstantiated, incomplete, and/or factually incorrect information, likely supplied with the intention of creating sensation and discrediting Amazon,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“Amazon remains compliant with all Indian laws. In the last several years, there have been number of changes in regulations governing the marketplaces and Amazon has, on each occasion taken rapid action to ensure compliance. The story therefore seems to have outdated information and does not show any non-compliance. We continue to focus on delivering first class service to India’s consumers, and helping India’s manufacturers and SMB’s reach customers across India and around the world,” it added.</p>
<p>Long-standing laws in India have constrained Amazon and other e-commerce firms to not hold inventory or sell items directly to consumers. To bypass this, the company has operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms. India got around to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/amazon-walmart-india-e-commerce-restrictions/">fixing this loophole</a> in late 2018.</p>
<p>Citing private company documents, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation/">said</a> that Amazon had exercised significant control over the inventory of some of the biggest sellers. The report claimed that 33 Amazon sellers accounted for about a third of the value of all goods sold on Amazon, and two sellers in which Amazon had an indirect stake accounted for around 35% of the platform’s sales revenue in early 2019.</p>
<p>The new report &#8212; and its potential repercussions &#8212; is just the latest headache for Amazon in India.</p>

<p><a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/">Fairwork</a>, an academic research project that benchmarks gig platforms against a set of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/flipkart-ranked-highly-for-fairness-of-working-conditions-in-india-gig-platform-study/">fairness principles</a> to  encourage these intermediaries to improve conditions for workers, said today that Uber&#8217;s call for special rules for the gig economy is an attempt to &#8220;<span data-contrast="auto">legitimize a lower level of protection for platform workers than most European workers benefit from.&#8221;<br />

<p><span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;Uber</span> <span data-contrast="auto">asserts that it recognizes the need for improved </span><span data-contrast="auto">conditions but</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is dependent on regulatory change to realize that goal. The company’s recognition of </span><span data-contrast="auto">dissatisfaction among drivers is </span><span data-contrast="auto">commendable</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">However, it is already well within their locus of control to address this dissatisfaction and improve conditions for its drivers </span><span data-contrast="auto">under</span><span data-contrast="auto"> existing legal </span><span data-contrast="auto">frameworks,&#8221; the platform work research group <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/blog/ubers-call-for-change-in-europe-shirks-responsibility-while-highlighting-real-challenges/">wrote in a response</a> to Uber&#8217;s &#8216;<a href="https://www.uber.com/global/en/about/reports/a-better-deal/">Better Deal</a>&#8216; white paper. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;<span data-contrast="auto">Uber’s focus on policy change, furthermore, downplays the company’s significant</span> <span data-contrast="auto">influence over conditions in</span><span data-contrast="auto"> the gig economy.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">By calling for new regulations, the company is shifting responsibility for workers’ conditions to other actors,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> when it could step up to the plate and provide an exemplar of how a platform can treat its </span><span data-contrast="auto">workers.&#8221;</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;Whilst w</span><span data-contrast="auto">e applaud Uber’s awareness of the need for change, we urge them to live up to their call,&#8221; Fairwork added. &#8220;The company has long set the blueprint for the gig economy, and, perhaps more than any other actor, is positioned to enact immediate change to improve the lives of their workers under current legal frameworks</span><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&#8220;</span></p>
<p>Fairwork noted that Uber has repeatedly fallen short of its (independent) benchmarks of &#8216;fair&#8217; platform work. (NB: We covered the start of its initiative <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/flipkart-ranked-highly-for-fairness-of-working-conditions-in-india-gig-platform-study/">here</a> back in 2019).</p>
<p>As we reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">earlier this week</a>, Uber is pushing for a &#8216;Prop 22&#8217;-style outcome in Europe, following its win in California last year when it convinced voters to exempt delivery and transport platform workers from employment classification laws &#8212; and as regional lawmakers are actively looking at how to improve the lot of gig workers.</p>
<p>In the white paper Uber has fired at EU lawmakers it argues that conditions for gig workers can only improve if regulators grant platforms a carve out from labor laws &#8212; lobbying for what it dubbed a &#8220;new standard&#8221; for gig work. However Fairwork argues this a blatant attempt to water down European employment standards, as Uber seeks to apply the same playbook it successfully deployed to reconfigure Californian legislation in its business interests.</p>

<p>Yet Europe is not California. And as Fairwork points out courts across the region have begun to roll back self-serving classifications of gig workers as &#8216;self-employed&#8217; &#8212; with a number of these <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">challenges going against Uber in recent years.</span></p>
<p>A major verdict is also looming for Uber Friday when the UK Supreme Court is expected to give the last word on an employment tribunal which it has been losing since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/uber-loses-employment-tribunal-in-the-uk/">2016</a>.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;All workers, regardless of how their work is arranged, deserve </span><span data-contrast="auto">decent</span><span data-contrast="auto"> wages and safe working conditions. </span><span data-contrast="auto">Labo</span><span data-contrast="auto">u</span><span data-contrast="auto">r </span><span data-contrast="auto">law</span> <span data-contrast="auto">provides</span> <span data-contrast="auto">these basic rights; </span><span data-contrast="auto">and </span><span data-contrast="auto">work arranged via a platform does not require </span><span data-contrast="auto">a</span><span data-contrast="auto"> radical new approach.</span> <span data-contrast="auto">The benefits proposed in Uber’s white paper</span><span data-contrast="auto">, like those provided under Proposition 22,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> represent </span><span data-contrast="auto">weakened</span> <span data-contrast="auto">versions of those </span><span data-contrast="auto">afforded</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to employees,&#8221; it added. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;We need to strengthen and expand existing labour protections in order to improve conditions, not create additional exclusions and exemptions that leave millions behind.&#8221;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Uber for any comment.<strong> Update: </strong>An Uber spokesperson said: &#8220;We welcome all views on this important topic. We must now work together to deliver a better deal for platform workers in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also told us it&#8217;s not lobbying to copypaste Prop 22 to Europe but does believe some of the same principles could be applied as regional lawmakers look at ways to improve the deal gig workers get &#8212; reiterating its view that a level playing field will be essential to delivering the kind of standardized improvements it&#8217;s pushing for.</p>
<p>The European Commission has yet to decide what kind of regulatory intervention it might make as regards gig work. But it has signalled an intention to do something in this area &#8212; and that&#8217;s likely been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic spotlighting the individual and public health risks when gig workers lack employment protections like sick pay.</p>
<p>In a 2019 mission letter, the EU president told the incoming jobs commissioner to look at ways to improve the lot of platform workers, writing that: “Dignified, transparent and predictable working conditions are essential to our economic model.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The only people who truly understand a relationship are the ones who are in it. Luckily for us, we&#8217;re going to have a candid conversation with both parties in the relationship between Ironclad CEO and co-founder Jason Boehmig and his investor and board member Accel partner Steve Loughlin.</p>
<p>Loughlin led Ironclad&#8217;s Series A deal back in 2017, making it one of his first Series A deals after returning to Accel.</p>
<p>This episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> goes down on Wednesday at 3 p.m. EST/12 p.m. PST, just like usual.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to the duo about how they met, what made them &#8220;choose&#8221; each other, and how they&#8217;ve operated as a duo since. How they built trust, maintain honesty and talk strategy are also on the table as part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Loughlin was an entrepreneur before he was an investor, founding RelateIQ (an Accel-backed company) in 2011. The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/11/salesforce-buys-big-data-startup-relateiq-for-up-to-390m/">acquired by Salesforce in 2014 for $390 million</a> and later became Salesforce IQ. Loughlin then &#8220;came back home&#8221; to Accel in 2016 and has led investments in companies like Airkit, Ascend.io, Clockwise, Ironclad, Monte Carlo, Nines, Productiv, Split.io and Vivun.</p>
<p>Not entirely unsurprising for a man who has dominated the legal tech sphere, Jason Boehmig is a California barred attorney who practiced law at Fenwick &amp; West and was also an adjunct professor of law at Notre Dame Law School. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ironclad/">Ironclad</a> launched in 2014 and today the company has raised more than $180 million and, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mary-meekers-vc-firm-bond-invests-in-ironclad-at-nearly-1-billion-valuation">reports</a>, is valued just under $1 billion.</p>
<p>Not only will we peel back the curtain on how this investor/founder relationship works, but we&#8217;ll also hear from these two tech leaders on their thoughts around bigger enterprise trends in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Then, it&#8217;s time for the pitch deck teardown. On each episode of Extra Crunch Live, we take a look at decks submitted by the audience and our experienced guests give their live feedback. If you want to throw your deck in the ring, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit your deck</a> for a future episode.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://dapr.io/">Dapr</a>, the Microsoft-incubated open-source project that aims to make it easier for developers to build event-driven, distributed cloud-native applications, hit its 1.0 milestone today, signifying the project&#8217;s readiness for production use cases. Microsoft launched the Distributed Application Runtime (that&#8217;s what &#8220;Dapr&#8221; stand for) back in October 2019. Since then, the project released 14 updates and the community launched integrations with virtually all major cloud providers, including Azure, AWS, Alibaba and Google Cloud.</p>
<p>The goal for Dapr, Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich told me, was to democratize cloud-native development for enterprise developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we go look at what enterprise developers are being asked to do &#8212; they&#8217;ve traditionally been doing client, server, web plus database-type applications,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;But now, we&#8217;re asking them to containerize and to create microservices that scale out and have no-downtime updates &#8212; and they&#8217;ve got to integrate with all these cloud services. And many enterprises are, on top of that, asking them to make apps that are portable across on-premises environments as well as cloud environments or even be able to move between clouds. So just tons of complexity has been thrown at them that&#8217;s not specific to or not relevant to the business problems they&#8217;re trying to solve.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And a lot of the development involves re-inventing the wheel to make their applications reliably talk to various other services. The idea behind Dapr is to give developers a single runtime that, out of the box, provides the tools that developers need to build event-driven microservices. Among other things, Dapr provides various building blocks for things like service-to-service communications, state management, pub/sub and secrets management.</p>

<p>&#8220;The goal with Dapr was: let&#8217;s take care of all of the mundane work of writing one of these cloud-native distributed, highly available, scalable, secure cloud services, away from the developers so they can focus on their code. And actually, we took lessons from serverless, from Functions-as-a-Service where with, for example Azure Functions, it&#8217;s event-driven, they focus on their business logic and then things like the bindings that come with Azure Functions take care of connecting with other services,&#8221; Russinovich said.</p>
<p>He also noted that another goal here was to do away with language-specific models and to create a programming model that can be leveraged from any language. Enterprises, after all, tend to use multiple languages in their existing code, and a lot of them are now looking at how to best modernize their existing applications &#8212; without throwing out all of their current code.</p>

<p>As Russinovich noted, the project now has more than 700 contributors outside of Microsoft (though the core commuters are largely from Microsoft) and a number of businesses started using it in production before the 1.0 release. One of the larger cloud providers that is already using it is Alibaba. &#8220;Alibaba Cloud has really fallen in love with Dapr and is leveraging it heavily,&#8221; he said. Other organizations that have contributed to Dapr include HashiCorp and early users like ZEISS, Ignition Group and New Relic.</p>
<p>And while it may seem a bit odd for a cloud provider to be happy that its competitors are using its innovations already, Russinovich noted that this was exactly the plan and that the team hopes to bring Dapr into a foundation soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been on a path to open governance for several months and the goal is to get this into a foundation. [&#8230;] The goal is opening this up. It&#8217;s not a Microsoft thing. It&#8217;s an industry thing,&#8221; he said &#8212; but he wasn&#8217;t quite ready to say to which foundation the team is talking.</p>
