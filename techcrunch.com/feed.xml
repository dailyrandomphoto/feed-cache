										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An iPhone hacking team has released a new jailbreak tool for almost every iPhone, including the most recent models, by using the same vulnerability that Apple last month said was under active attack by hackers.</p>
<p>The Unc0ver team <a href="https://twitter.com/Pwn20wnd/status/1365833293069975557">released its latest jailbreak</a> this weekend, and says it works on iOS 11 (iPhone 5s and later) to iOS 14.3, which Apple released in December.</p>
<p>Jailbreaking is a cat-and-mouse game between security researchers who want greater control and customizations over their phones, and Apple, which says it locks down iPhones for security. Hackers build jailbreak tools by finding and exploiting vulnerabilities that can lift some of the restrictions that Apple puts in place, like installing apps outside of its app store, which most Android users are already used to.</p>
<p>In a tweet, the jailbreak group said it used its &#8220;own exploit&#8221; for CVE-2021-1782, a kernel vulnerability that Apple said was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/">one of three flaws</a> that &#8220;may have been actively exploited&#8221; by hackers. By targeting the kernel, the hackers are able to get deep hooks into the underlying operating system.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We wrote our own exploit based on CVE-2021-1782 for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unc0ver?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#unc0ver</a> to achieve optimal exploit speed and stability.</p>
<p>&mdash; @Pwn20wnd (@Pwn20wnd) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pwn20wnd/status/1364878565523787777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146">fixed the vulnerability</a> in iOS 14.4, released last month, which also prevents the jailbreak from working on later versions. It was a rare admission that the iPhone was under active attack by hackers, but the company declined to say who the hackers were and who they were targeting. Apple also granted anonymity to the researcher who submitted the bug.</p>
<p>The group&#8217;s last jailbreak, which supported iPhones running iOS 11 to iOS 13.5, was fixed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/hackers-iphone-new-jailbreak/">in a matter of days</a> last year. Apple works quickly to understand and fix the vulnerabilities found by jailbreak groups, since these same vulnerabilities can be exploited maliciously.</p>
<p>Security experts generally advise iPhone users against jailbreaking because it makes the device more vulnerable to attacks. And while keeping your phone up to date may introduce security fixes that remove the jailbreak, it&#8217;s one of the best ways of keeping your device secure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe, and their cities.</p>
<p>Our &lt;a href=&#8221;https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6”>survey of investors in Zagreb will capture how Croatia is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how the Croatian startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/</p>
<p>For example, here is the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub/">survey of London</a>.</p>
<p>You are not in Croatia, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to your country next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every country on in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email mike@techcrunch.com</p>
<p>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>. </em></p>
<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>In last week&#8217;s newsletter, I described some of the changes coming to TechCrunch&#8217;s transportation coverage, including &#8220;market maps.&#8221; These articles, which run will always run in Extra Crunch, focus on a particular slice of the transportation industry, along with other mobility-related analysis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The first of these took a deep dive into the solid state battery industry. As Mark Harris reported: For the last decade, developers of solid state battery systems have promised products that are vastly safer, lighter and more powerful. Those promises largely evaporated into the ether — leaving behind a vapor stream of disappointing products, failed startups and retreating release dates.</p>
<p>A new wave of companies and technologies are finally maturing and attracting the funding necessary to feed batteries’ biggest market: transportation. Keep reading here: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">Can solid state batteries power up the next generation of EVs?</a></p>
<p>This week look out for our revamped automotive reviews, an interview with Joby Aviation founder JoeBen Birt, Paul Sciarra, the company&#8217;s executive chair and co-founder of Pinterest and Reid Hofffman, whose SPAC merged with Joby as well as a chat with Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson. Two new reporters, who will be helping to expand and deepen our transportation coverage, are also starting this coming week.</p>
<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1894192 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png" alt="the station scooter1a" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Micromobbin&#8217; is short and sweet this week. I wanted to flag this upcoming panel.</p>
<p>A free panel called Women on Wheels: Making Micromobility Safer for Female Riders will be held 12 p.m. to 12:45 p.m. ET on March 8. The panel will focus on women and safety. Reservations are required to join. Visit the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/women-on-wheels-tickets-142263214103">Eventbrite link here</a> to register.</p>
<p>Speakers include ScootRoute Founder and CEO Meghan Braley, who is hosting the event, SomEV co-founder and battery engineer Natasha George and Saturday Night Bike Club&#8217;s director of cyclist engagement, Ashley Ndiaye.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>After weeks of speculation, <strong>Lucid Motors</strong> finally announced it would become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">publicly traded company</a> through a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp.</p>
<p>A string of EV automakers and charging infrastructure companies have taken the SPAC merger path to public markets over the past 10 months, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/arrival-becomes-latest-electric-vehicle-startup-to-test-the-public-markets-with-a-spac/">Arrival</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/electric-vehicle-startup-canoo-to-go-public-via-spac/">Canoo</a>, ChargePoint, EVgo, Fisker and Lordstown Motors. But this one is by far the largest.</p>
<p>The combined company, in which Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund will continue to be the largest shareholder, will have a transaction equity value of $11.75 billion. Private investment in the public equity deal is priced at $15 a share, putting the implied pro-forma equity value at $24 billion.</p>
<p>I interviewed CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson after the deal was announced. Watch out for an article based on what he said this coming week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another deal worth noting was <strong>Joby Aviation&#8217;s</strong> announcement that it would become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/joby-aviation-takes-flight-into-the-public-markets-via-a-spac-merger/">public company through a merger</a> with Reinvent Technology Partners, a special purpose acquisition company from well-known investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Zynga founder Mark Pincus. The combined company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will have a pro forma implied valuation of $6.6 billion.</p>
<p>Joby Aviation has spent a more than a decade developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft. Joby plans to use the capital to fund the launch of passenger service, which is expected to begin in 2024. The company still must complete certification of its aircraft and develop manufacturing facilities, but it is already on its way to achieving both.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong>, which recently closed its acquisition of Uber&#8217;s self-driving subsidiary, bought its<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> second lidar startup in less than two years. Aurora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/aurora-acquires-a-second-lidar-company-in-push-to-bring-self-driving-trucks-to-the-road/">acquired OURS Technology</a>, a 12-person startup the founded in 2017 by a team of University of California-Berkeley researchers and PhDs. Two years ago, Aurora a</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">cquired Blackmore, a Montana-based lidar startup. </span></p>

<p><strong>Gophr</strong>, a U.K.-based last-mile delivery startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/gophr/">raised £4 million</a> ($5.5 million) in a funding round led by pan-European B2B investor Nauta Capital.</p>
<p><strong>Manbang</strong>, the Chinese truck-hailing company backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd., confidentially filed for an initial public offering that could raise at least $1 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/china-trucking-startup-said-to-file-confidentially-for-u-s-ipo?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>

<p><strong>WiTricity</strong>, the EV wireless charging company, announced an additional $18 million to its previously announced fund raise of $34 million. The extension included investments from Tony Fadell&#8217;s Future Shape and other private investors. Fadell is also joining the board.</p>
<p><strong>Xos</strong>, the commercial electric vehicle manufacturer, plans to go public <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210222005244/en/Xos-a-Leading-Commercial-Electric-Vehicle-OEM-to-Become-Publicly-Traded-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-with-NextGen-Acquisition-Corporation">through a merger</a> with a blank-check company, NextGen Acquisition Corp., in a deal valued at $2 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Zomato</strong>, the Indian food delivery startup, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-valued-at-5-4-billion-in-new-250-million-investment/">raised $250 million</a>, just two months after closing a $660 million Series J financing round.</p>
<h2>A little bird</h2>

<p>Back in October, the city of New York released its request for interest in its electric scooter pilot, officially kicking off what promised to be a competitive battle among companies vying for a chance to operate their businesses in there.</p>
<p>The city also released a request for expressions of interest, or &#8220;RFEI,&#8221; for companies that provide ancillary services to the electric scooter industry, such as data aggregation and analysis, on-street charging and parking vendors, safe-riding training courses as well as scooter collection and impound services.</p>
<p>New York is one of two large markets — London being the other — that has yet name the companies that will receive these highly coveted permits. My sources are telling me that New York will announce this week which companies landed permits for the pilot. It&#8217;s possible London will make a similar announcement.</p>
<p>Last week, the New York City Department of Transportation announced the geographic boundaries for the e-scooter pilot will be in eastern Bronx neighborhoods from Eastchester and Co-op City to Throggs Neck and Soundview, an 18-square-mile area home to 570,000 residents. The pilot is expected to launch in the late spring, will run for a minimum of one year. The pilot is estimated to bring as many as 2,000 to 3,000 scooters to the East Bronx during Phase 1 with an increase to as many as 4,000 to 6,000 in a potential second phase in 2022.</p>
<h2>A quick history lesson</h2>

<p>Remember the ID Buzz, the reimagined microbus that Volkswagen first showed off as a prototype at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit? The vehicle has been in development since then and on Friday, we received another update on its future.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said it is aiming to have a Level 4 autonomous ID.Buzz in service for commercial use by 2025. Argo AI, the self-driving startup backed by Ford and Volkswagen, is providing the autonomous driving technology that will allow these microbuses to navigate urban environments without a human behind the wheel.</p>
<p>The company is conducting field trials in Germany this year.</p>
<p>The idea is to use these microbuses for a ride-hailing and sharing service similar to what Moia offers today in Germany. VW noted that its commercial vehicle division will develop and build Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV), such as robotaxis and vans.</p>
<p>The announcement suggests that progress is being made. However, it&#8217;s important to note VW&#8217;s previous timelines and intentions.</p>
<p>In 2016, VW Group launched Moia as a separate company focused on providing mobility solutions, including fleet-based commuter shuttles and, eventually, autonomous on-demand transportation.</p>
<p>Ole Harms, who was Moia&#8217;s CEO when it launched, was on the TechCrunch stage in London back in 2016. At the time, he said the first pilots of autonomous driving deployments would come earlier than the 2021 date cited by many competitors for the arrival of self-driving tech.</p>
<p>VW Group tapped self-driving startup Aurora and in January 2018 announced plans to launch commercial fleets of self-driving electric vehicles in two to five cities beginning in 2021. Volks­wagen said at the time that it planned to launch two types of test fleets using Aurora tech, including one for ride-pooling that would use Moia shuttles and another for door-to-door ride-hailing service in the U.S. and Germany.</p>
<p>Aurora and VW&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/vws-partnership-with-self-driving-car-startup-aurora-has-ended/">partnership ended</a> 18 months later.</p>
<p>VW&#8217;s launch date — along with the timelines from virtually every other AV developer — was pushed back. This time around, will VW aided by Argo, meet its deadline?</p>

<p>A few more items to note this week.</p>
<p><strong>Foxconn Technology Group</strong> reached a tentative agreement with electric vehicle startup-turned-SPAC Fisker to develop and eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/apple-supplier-foxconn-reaches-tentative-agreement-to-build-fiskers-next-electric-car/">manufacture an EV</a> that will be sold in North America, Europe, China and India. The deal isn&#8217;t done yet though.</p>
<p>This is just a memorandum of understanding agreement. Discussions between the two companies will continue with the expectation that a formal partnership agreement will be reached during the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Speaking of Fisker, The Verge reported that the electric vehicle startup has<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22279995/fisker-inc-electric-vehicle-interview-solid-state-batteries-ocean-suv-spac"> dropped plans</a> to create a solid-state battery and that last July it quietly settled a previously unreported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/21355123/fisker-quantumscape-lawsuit-trade-secret-solid-state-batteries-fsr-qs">trade secret lawsuit</a> with Volkswagen-backed solid-state battery company QuantumScape.</p>
<p><strong>Flipkart</strong> said it will deploy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/flipkart-to-deploy-over-25000-electric-vehicles-by-2030/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">more than 25,000 electric vehicles</a> in its supply chain by 2030 as the Walmart-owned e-commerce giant looks to achieve a 100% transition to electric mobility in the next 10 years. The Bangalore-headquartered firm said it partnered with leading EV makers including Hero Electric, Mahindra Electric and Piaggio to build vehicles for its first and last-mile delivery fleets across the country.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> said just a day before the Flipkart announcement that it partnered with Mahindra Electric to develop &#8220;close to hundred&#8221; electric three-wheelers in India. The American e-commerce giant last year pledged to deploy 10,000 electric vehicles in the country by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Nikola</strong>, the controversial electric truck maker, is trying to make fresh start, admitting in a recent <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000173128921000006/nkla-20201231.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission filing</a> that nine statements made by founder Trevor Milton were &#8220;inaccurate.&#8221; Milton, you might remember, resigned from Nikola in September, after a report from noted short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the company of fraud.</p>
<p>The company is also narrowing its focus, getting rid of the various side projects that Milton started. The SEC filing showed the company took a $14.4 million impairment expense after discontinuing the Powersports business unit.</p>
<p><strong>Sergey Brin&#8217;s</strong> secretive airship company LTA Research and Exploration is planning to power a huge disaster relief airship with an equally record-breaking hydrogen fuel cell, according to a job listing spotted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/sergey-brins-airship-will-use-worlds-biggest-mobile-hydrogen-fuel-cell/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Mark Harris</a>.</p>
<p><strong>United States Postal Service</strong> awarded a 10-year, $485-million contract to Oshkosh Defense to deliver between 50,000 and 165,000 Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/usps-picks-a-new-mail-truck-and-no-they-wont-all-be-electric/">Ars Technica reported</a>. The first trucks are due on the road in 2023. Only 10% of the new delivery trucks will be battery electric, which seems to conflict with the new Biden Administration&#8217;s plans to replace the entire federal fleet with EVs. The news sent shares of <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/workhorse-share-collapse-raises-pressure-on-debt-repayment">Workhorse Group Inc</a>. into a free fall.</p>

<p>Businesses, and the tech platforms that support their operations, had to adapt quickly to the pandemic. Ben Thompson, co-founder and chief executive officer of human resources platform <a href="https://employmenthero.com/">Employment Hero</a> told TechCrunch that &#8220;COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of employment management software by roughly five years,&#8221; as teams adjusted to remote work.</p>
<p>The Sydney, Australia-based company announced today it has raised a $45 million AUD (about $34.8 million) Series D, bringing its valuation to more than $250 million AUD ($193.4 million USD). The capital will be used for expansion and growth in markets including New Zealand, Southeast Asia and the United Kingdom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round was led by <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/">SEEK</a>, which runs job platforms around the world, with participation from OneVentures and AirTreeVentures, all returning investors. Employment Hero also added Salesforce Ventures as a new investor.</p>
<p>Employment Hero is designed for small-to-medium sized businesses, and combines human resources, payroll and benefits features. It currently serves about 6,000 SMEs with a combined total of more than 250,000 employees. Employment Hero doubled the number of its full-time employees to 200 last year, and launched versions in New Zealand, the UK, Malaysia and Singapore. Its Series D will be used to support growth in those markets, and enter new Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Localized versions of Employment Hero include pre-built employment contracts and policies that comply with local laws. In Malaysia and Singapore, the platform provided research on recruitment and employment trends, Thompson said, and in Singapore, it gathered COVID-related government support materials into one factsheet.</p>
<p>Employment Hero also renewed its partnership with SEEK, which means the platform includes SEEK job ads in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, the company launched a new service called Global Teams for remote work. It serves as a professional employer organization (PEO), enabling companies to recruit new remote employees around the world and automating regional compliance paperwork. Global Teams is integrated into the main Employment Hero platform, so remote employees have access to the same resources as their colleagues.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 75% of Employment Hero’s customer base upgraded their subscriptions to include tools for remote work management, compliance and employee wellness services.</p>
<p>For example, during the first week of Australia’s nationwide lockdown, Employment Hero launched a COVID-19 resource hub, including tools for the government&#8217;s JobKeeper payment scheme and employee wellness surveys. It also ran biweekly webinars with industry experts about employees’ rights to leave and pay, mental health and employee assistance programs, cashflow management, employer duty of care for remote work arrangements and live employment law.</p>
<p>As remote work continued, Employment Hero also introduced engagement and productivity features, like one-on-one coaching and other tools to improve communication and feedback.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a company, we knew we had to do whatever it took to help our clients and the wider small and medium-sized business community through COVID-19,&#8221; said Thompson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/clue/">Clue</a>, an early pioneer in the femtech category with a well-regarded <a href="https://helloclue.com">period-tracking app</a> that&#8217;s used by around 13 million people, is getting ready to launch a digital contraceptive which will offer users a statistical prediction of ovulation as a birth control tool.</p>
<p>A US launch of Clue Birth Control is slated for &#8220;this year&#8221;. The team won’t be more specific on the date yet.</p>
<p>Pricing will be &#8220;premium&#8221; — but they’re also keeping the exact cost under wraps for now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Berlin-based company is today announcing that they&#8217;ve gained FDA clearance for the forthcoming product, clearing the way for a US launch in 2021.</p>
<p>Europe is the next region on their launch list but the necessary regulatory clearances mean the roll out will be gradual, going market by market.</p>
<p>The startup has also recently made a number of operational changes &#8212; including to the leadership of the company &#8212; to reflect becoming a medical-device grade regulated entity in the US.</p>
<p>The short version is that founder and CEO, Ida Tin, has moved up to become chairwoman of the board, while Audrey Tsang (who was leading product) and Carrie Walter (formerly general counsel), are now Clue’s co-CEOs.</p>
<p>TechCrunch chatted to all three women &#8212; along with Clue&#8217;s chief medical officer, Lynae Brayboy &#8212; to get the lowdown on its latest news.</p>
<h2>Clue Birth Control</h2>
<p>Clue is not the first to market with an app offering a statistical prediction of fertility but unlike first mover, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/04/natural-cycles-gets-6m-to-convince-more-women-to-ditch-the-pill/?_ga=2.5773872.26562040.1614535676-1757155993.1533833482">Natural Cycles</a> &#8212; which gained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/the-fda-okd-an-app-as-a-form-of-birth-control/">FDA clearance back in 2018</a> &#8212; its product, Clue Birth Control, is being billed as &#8220;all-digital&#8221;; aka it will work without the user needing to take their temperature daily.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also no need to track other bodily changes (such as monitoring cervical fluid). The method is based on women inputting a single data point regularly: The start date of their period.</p>
<p>This means it looks like a major step up in &#8216;ease of use&#8217; vs the earlier-to-market rival &#8212; which Clue has achieved within similar efficacy margins (see below).</p>
<p>Clue&#8217;s algorithmic prediction is based on Bayesian modelling — with the app displaying a high risk window across a number of days of the user’s cycle, during which having unprotected intercourse could result in the woman getting pregnant. It shows a window of low risk when the opposite is true.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2118831,2118832,2118830,2118829,2118828"]</p>
<p>The length of these windows is likely to change as the user inputs more data, with the risk-window starting out longer and typically shrinking as the app becomes more personalized to their individual cycle data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bayesian modelling has been used in medicine for a lot of different applications. What that does is it takes population data and it puts that population data into an algorithm &#8212; which is a mathematical model &#8212; and [that] basically borrows from what has been found in the population in terms of cycling and ovulation,&#8221; explains Brayboy, who was appointed as Clue&#8217;s first ever chief medical officer last summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before we had a fertile window [i.e. displayed in the Clue period-tacking app to illustrate the stages of a cycle] &#8212; which is not a reliable, nor is it a tested, model of contraception. So now we&#8217;re using a bayesian modelling concept,&#8221; she says. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;It personalizes over time. So as the individual puts in their cycle day one then we&#8217;re able to personalize the window of their high risk days vs their low risk days.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;[The high risk window] will start out long&#8230; Usually it&#8217;ll be 16 days within the cycle &#8212; but it&#8217;ll shorten over time. It probably won&#8217;t shorten to more than 11 days.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the product to work as a contraception, users must either abstain from sex on high risk days or use additional protection (such as condoms). That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a more involved method than some established birth control alternatives (especially vs an IUD; intrauterine device). On low risk days Clue users are relying on the app’s statistical prediction of their (low) fertility risk to not get pregnant.</p>
<p>Clue says the product has been shown to be 92% effective at preventing unwanted pregnancy under &#8216;typical use&#8217; and 97% effective under &#8216;perfect use&#8217; &#8212; referencing the standard research terminology for measuring contraception effectiveness (the latter meaning the product is used exactly as instructed every time the woman has sex vs &#8216;typical&#8217; use which accounts for some usage slip-ups).</p>
<p>What those percentages mean in practice is that under typical use, eight couples out of 100 would be predicted to get pregnant over a year of use of Clue&#8217;s digital birth control. While &#8212; in the perfect use scenario &#8212; the failure rate would be three out of 100 over a year&#8217;s use.</p>
<p>(For comparison, Natural Cycles says its product is 93% effective under typical use and 98% effective under perfect use; while &#8212; per the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-effectiveness-united-states">Guttmacher Institute</a>&#8216;s US study &#8212; the pill is 93% effective under typical use and 99% effective under perfect use; and male condoms are 87% effective under typical use vs 98% effective under perfect use.)</p>
<p>Clue isn’t disclosing how many users it’s expecting to sign up — but the length of time it’s taken to bring the product to market suggests it’s confident Clue Birth Control will find a sustainable user base. (It&#8217;s been quietly working on the development since at least 2019 &#8212; but will only say the product has been &#8220;a long time&#8221; in the works when we ask.)</p>
<p>The extra time Clue&#8217;s taken to bring its digital contraceptive to market does look like time well spent. The statistical method underlying Clue Birth Control has, for example, undergone rigorous pre-market clinical testing &#8212; via a prospective effectiveness <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13625187.2019.1581164">trial</a> which reported results back in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been in development for a long time because work like this and proving the efficacy of something like this takes a long time,&#8221; says Tsang. &#8220;From a product perspective as well we want to make sure that these are experiences [that are] easy to understand and that matches the safety and efficacy of this type of product. So that as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a long time to make sure that we develop something that is also usability validated on that front and that we put that out with confidence and with an exact understanding of how well users will understand that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ovulation prediction algorithm was put through a year-long, full-scale, representative (of the US population), independent clinical trial involving more than 700 women. This was conducted by researchers at the Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH) at Georgetown University in partnership with a third company, called Cycle Technologies &#8212; using a research app, called DOT (Dynamic Optimal Timing), for the purpose of the trial.</p>
<p>Clue says it acquired the assets of DOT — both the algorithm and the app — in summer 2019 and it’s that clinically validated technology which it&#8217;s implementing into its own app now, as Clue Birth Control.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a &#8216;proper&#8217;, full scale clinical trial that was designed to be a clinical trial &#8212; rather than put a product out there, see if it works and collect the data,&#8221; says Walter. &#8220;This was done by academics. We then bought the algorithm and the app and we implemented the features of the app into Clue Birth Control which is a feature of Clue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The clinical trial shows you both what the algorithm does and how the user interacts with the app. Because the algorithm is only part of the story &#8212; the main part is can a woman understand what&#8217;s going on, track and check and then act on the information,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>The FDA clearance process for Clue Birth Control involved scrutiny of the efficacy of the algorithm’s statistical predictions and also how Clue presents the information to users. So the whole package has been examined by the regulator. (To be clear the DOT app was not FDA cleared; rather Clue implemented that clinically tested algorithm in its own app and submitted the package for FDA clearance.)</p>
<p>&#8220;When you get FDA clearance as a medical device that is for a very specific product &#8212; you don&#8217;t then get to just take it away and tinker with it,&#8221; says Walter. &#8220;So I&#8217;m sure that there will be further iterations. This is iteration one of a new kind of birth control &#8212; but as of right now the thing that is going into our app is the thing that FDA saw and cleared. So the only piece&#8230; that we put significant creative work into was making sure that the usability interface is totally user tested and safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Going forward, Clue’s business processes will be subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny — a considerable switch for the startup that Tin describes as a &#8220;huge maturing process&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another big part of the work that happened is to live and be a regulated company,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch. &#8220;That in itself is a very big change and a huge amount of work&#8230; So that&#8217;s another thing that has to happen. So one thing is what you put out in the market that users see but as a company you really have to operate in a completely new way &#8212; it&#8217;s a huge maturing process that we have gone through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like the baby can walk and talk and is actually more like a teenager and now it&#8217;s like leaving home &#8212; and I say you can do this!&#8221; she adds when asked what it feels like to see her femtech startup becoming FDA regulated.</p>
<h2>Suitability</h2>
<p>No method of contraception &#8212; except for abstinence &#8212; is 100% effective, of course. But just comparing the varying efficacy percentages of different contraception methods may not be super helpful given how personal birth control choices are.</p>
<p>A digital contraceptive certainly has a bunch of pros and cons that need to be considered. And Clue is being up front that its product is not suitable for everyone.</p>
<p>Top line: Clue says Clue Birth Control is only suitable for women, aged between 18-45, who have regular periods. (It also says: Users must also be able to track their period; check the app each day they have sex; and be prepared to use a condom or avoid sex that may result in pregnancy on high-risk days.)</p>
<p>Clearly there are various additional considerations beyond having a regular cycle that potential users should weigh up before signing up. Not least being comfortable with the stated degree of pregnancy risk.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s also true of all FABM (fertility awareness based methods) of birth control &#8212; including the old fashioned, non-digital/manual-tracking version (sometimes referred to as the rhythm or calendar method). But app-based products like Natural Cycles and Clue Birth Control are undoubtedly making FABM accessible to more women. Which means that communicating &#8212; and even enforcing &#8212; suitability is a key component of responsible product development in this category.</p>
<p>This is because the level of commitment and attention to detail required to act on changing fertility information makes FABM more complex than some birth control options. An IUD, for example, works without a woman needing to do anything once it’s been inserted. The pill is also more simplistic &#8212; in the sense that it only requires a woman to remember to take a tablet daily.</p>
<p>At the same time, it’s clear that hormonal contraception isn’t for everyone &#8212; or may not be accessible to everyone (Brayboy points to rising difficulty for US women specifically to access contraception as a relevant point here, for instance). And the convenience of an app-based form of personalised contraception has quickly convinced a new generation of women to try an alternative. (Natural Cycles’ reported some 1.5 million users worldwide last year.)</p>
<p>App-based convenience can invite missteps too, though. After its launch in Europe in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/natural-cycles-gets-30m-for-its-eu-certified-digital-contraception/">2017</a> Natural Cycles quickly attracted criticism over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/contraception-app-natural-cycles-facebook-ad-banned-for-being-misleading/">misleading</a> and aggressive social media marketing. It was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/clinic-reports-natural-cycles-app-for-37-unwanted-pregnancies-since-september/">investigated in Sweden</a> after a hospital in its home market reported a number of unintended pregnancies from women who had been using the app. Although that probe confirmed the number of pregnancies was within the claimed margin of efficacy Natural Cycles agreed with the regulator to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/natural-cycles-contraception-app-told-to-clarify-pregnancy-risks/">clarify the risk of its product failing</a>.</p>
<p>So how digital birth control is presented is a vital consideration.</p>
<p>Clue doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s taking any risks with how it communicates suitability for Clue Birth Control &#8212; prospective users have to go through an eligibility process which requires them to not just <em>say</em> they&#8217;re eligible but demonstrate eligibility by being able to provide key information, including about their own cycle.</p>
<p>If the user can&#8217;t show eligibility the app will &#8220;boot them out&#8221;, as Tsang puts it. She says they&#8217;ll also then be locked out for a period of time so they can&#8217;t just go back in and try different answers. While users whose cycle becomes too irregular for the product to work properly will similarly be prevented from continued use.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a very detailed assessment process as soon as you try to sign up for Clue Birth Control,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It asks you a series of questions that really even in the questions themselves and how you answer &#8212; it&#8217;s like a question with a drop-down underneath it &#8212; even in how we&#8217;ve set those up it makes it so that users actually have to explicitly say that they are eligible. It&#8217;s not a true/false kind of situation. It&#8217;s &#8216;how are old are you&#8217;?&#8230; We ask these explicit questions so what that does is it actually draws the information out of the user in a way where we can be sure that they are actually eligible to use this feature as it is regulated to be used.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That process itself was scrutinized in detail by FDA,&#8221; adds Walter. &#8220;This is a device that you can use in the privacy of your phone &#8212; nobody else has to be involved in it &#8212; so it&#8217;s really important that that funnel is correct and so that is something that we talked about in a lot of detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;And one thing that you do need to be aware of is that you&#8217;re not going to be able to answer these questions unless you have some awareness of your cycle going in. Because you&#8217;ve got to know is your cycle typically this long or this long. What does your longest cycle look like? What&#8217;s your shortest cycle look like over the last 12 months?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The [FDA] clearance is related to the product as presented. The product &#8212; because it relies purely on one data input and statistical predictions &#8212; there&#8217;s obviously some level of&#8230; &#8216;irregularity&#8217;,&#8221; Walter adds. &#8220;If your periods are wildly unpredictable this isn&#8217;t going to work. What our science team says is&#8230; about 70-80% of currently cycling women fall within the bandwidth that could be covered by it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s 20-40 day cycles and 9 days or less of variation between them. So it&#8217;s not like you have to know to the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that it&#8217;s impossible to be perfect and so we make sure to tell people that typical use is 92% and so we don&#8217;t at all try to oversell ourselves. And that this is better than doing many things which are commonly done by users in the US,&#8221; says Brayboy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pill and the IUD have very very defined risks,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;So we essentially explain that we are not as effective as those methods but our users potentially would have benefits because some of them cannot tolerate those methods for whatever reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately a lot of people do rely on <em>coitus interruptus</em> and a lot of people do rely on condoms which are great but you have to use condoms every single time in order to be effective. And so those individuals might really benefit from having some idea of where they are in their cycle and it&#8217;s not only some idea &#8212; it&#8217;s a rigorously looked at algorithm that they can use in the privacy of their home,&#8221; Brayboy goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really getting difficult&#8230; for a lot of American women to actually access birth control. One because of job loss; two because of a recent supreme court ruling in 2020 about opting out of contraceptive coverage. And so this is something they can do in collaboration with their healthcare providers but they don&#8217;t have to go out to a pharmacy and hopefully people will see that it&#8217;s easy to use. It really is easy to use. You never [don&#8217;t] leave your phone at home so you can&#8217;t lose this contraception.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another major consideration for users of digital contraception is that unprotected sex offers no protection against STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) &#8212; rates of which have been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2019/2018-STD-surveillance-report-press-release.html">increasing in the US in recent years</a>.</p>
<p>Clue therefore recommends its product for women who are in stable relationships &#8212; and/or are getting regularly screened, along with their partner/s &#8212; i.e. rather than for those who don&#8217;t know the sexual history of the people they&#8217;re sleeping with.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was sort of a premise from the beginning that we only want people to use this product for whom it&#8217;s really truly a good product,&#8221; says Tin. &#8220;It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re building this product because we think many people will benefit from it and we&#8217;ve seen many people needing it and so that&#8217;s the core. We want to be helpful. We don&#8217;t want people to use it for whom it&#8217;s not a good solution. And that&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve built it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked who the &#8216;perfect/ideal&#8217; user for Clue Birth Control, Brayboy puts it like this: &#8220;This is someone who &#8212; as I envisage as a physician &#8212; potentially wants to get pregnant in the next couple of years but is not ready and does not want to use hormonal birth control for whatever reason and is already using condoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is someone who wants to not get pregnant just now but is preparing, is planning &#8212; and they don&#8217;t want something that&#8217;s long acting.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also points out that many of the most effective methods of contraception (&#8220;like the levonorgestrel IUD or the Mirena&#8221;, which are ~99.9%) have draw-backs too &#8212; in that they have to be placed and removed from the woman&#8217;s uterus. They may also, she suggests, have a long term effect on the endometrium.</p>
<p>&#8220;So [Clue Birth Control] is something where if you decide okay in the next few years you want to get pregnant you absolutely can stop [following the regime] and you can get pregnant. And you also have a better idea of your cycles at the same time &#8212; so it gives you that added benefit,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;Again, our indication&#8217;s 18-45 but a lot of people who are in their late 20s and 30s would be ideal candidates for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tin also points to the &#8220;staggering amount of unwanted pregnancies&#8221; in the US and around the world &#8212; noting that many women currently still don&#8217;t use any birth control, for whatever reason. So an app-based fertility prediction might be an alternative that works for them.</p>
<p>Brayboy notes that unintended pregnancy in the US is about 45% but can be as high as 69% in some ethnic groups, per figures from the <a href="https://www.acog.org">American College of OBGYN</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unintended pregnancy is also hard to study because people don&#8217;t typically plan to become pregnant &#8212; and so it makes it difficult. But this [app-based FABM] is a way &#8212; also people could really think about how do I want to plan my family in the next couple of years? And so it really is a lovely way for people to start really thinking about becoming parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The marketing for Clue Birth Control will reflect that it&#8217;s a &#8220;serious choice&#8221; people are making to opt for a digital birth control, per Tsang.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We make sure that people understand that no form of birth control is 100% effective. And that this is a choice &#8212; and this is a serious choice that they make,&#8221; she says. &#8220;In our marketing we plan to help people make that choice &#8212; make a choice that&#8217;s right for them. And be transparent about the risks and how it works and what it means.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that we don&#8217;t have huge plans to do social media and influencer marketing,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;But again we do have these standard operating procedures that make sure that we both speak about the labelling, we speak about our product in a way that reflects exactly what it is.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Retooling to be regulated</h2>
<p>The aforementioned changes to Clue&#8217;s leadership team are coupled with a wider retooling of its internal processes &#8212; reflective of its new status as a regulated company.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Something that a lot of people aren&#8217;t aware of is that to be allowed to have a medical device on the market you have to operate a quality management system that covers your entire company. And as you know if you cover tech startups that&#8217;s not how tech startups tend to work!&#8221; says Walter. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Which is why it&#8217;s incredibly important if you&#8217;re going to use an app to make important life decisions about your health you want to make sure they&#8217;re building their product in a quality controlled way. And of course any app that you find out there on the market that is not a regulated medical device pretty much 100% will not be working in this way. And so one of the things that we had to do &#8212; and that we will be audited for once we have the product in the market &#8212; is to show that all of our processes, from design over software development, testing, user testing, all of these things are quality controlled every step of the way. So that&#8217;s the big change that we&#8217;ve gone through in the last two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a really big change,&#8221; adds Tin. &#8220;And for us it&#8217;s been important to get the team along in a really good way &#8212; not lose who we are. We think of it as acquiring a new ninja skill &#8212; something new that we&#8217;re learning to do that we&#8217;re adding to who we are &#8212; so that we can still be user focused and maintain all the qualities that we care about and always have cared about but now doing it sort of at a higher level under this quality management system.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s very well aligned with who we are because essentially a quality management system&#8217;s about quality and risk and care, essentially, for users &#8212; and we feel a lot of responsibility putting out a product that help people navigate really big, important things, like getting pregnant, not getting pregnant, so we feel good about making sure that our processes match that level of responsibility. So in that way it&#8217;s been easy to get the team along but I will say it&#8217;s been a huge amount of work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how many thousands of pages of technical documentation that we have submitted etc. It&#8217;s really like a huge rehaul. So the fact that we can maintain still feeling like Clue while operating in a very new way I&#8217;m pretty happy about. Because we could also become very boring &#8212; big, corporate-ish &#8212; but that isn&#8217;t who we are and that&#8217;s important because of course we want to keep caring about users.&#8221;</p>
<p>For all the extra paperwork, Tsang says Clue&#8217;s mission as a company hasn&#8217;t &#8212; and isn&#8217;t &#8212; changing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just very value-aligned. We&#8217;re here to put something out that&#8217;s high quality and where we have a clear procedure and clear processes for evaluating risk and mitigating risk. And that&#8217;s all completely values aligned with being a femtech company that empowers women to make healthy choices,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody is going to go out there and say well we play fast and loose with people&#8217;s health. Nobody wants to do that but it helps to have a third party watch you &#8212; and that&#8217;s what it means to be a regulated company. It means that there are democratically accountable government institutions looking over your shoulder and checking,&#8221; adds Walter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think if you&#8217;re looking at some of the criticism that femtech has come into recently &#8212; legitimately &#8212; because there are all kinds of apps out there that are completely unregulated, no one knows where they&#8217;re coming from, no one knows what their business models are, no one knows what they&#8217;re really doing. And this is a strong move in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We take the constraints that flow from that seriously&#8230; As Ida says we&#8217;re going to try not to lose our fun in the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team does also see wider opportunities flowing from being a regulated entity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this broadens our mission too,&#8221; says Brayboy. &#8220;Period tracking is really important in overall health but I think this allows individuals to use FABM in a modern way &#8212; and FABM itself can help individuals take in things in their cycles that might actually affect their fertility long term and also some diagnosis that might be important to speak with their physician about early, so they present to care early. So we hope to have that partnership with users and their healthcare providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have plans to do [comparative studies with other types of contraception] but what I&#8217;d like to say is that we have a post-market surveillance plan and we&#8217;ll be doing studies with collaborators &#8212; we&#8217;ve already started to collaborate with academia before Clue Birth Control came out so it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ll continue to do,&#8221; she also says. &#8220;W<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hat we&#8217;ll be doing in future is we&#8217;ll be going to clinical meetings, and presenting and allowing people to collaborate with us. And I think that&#8217;s really important that our doors are open for physician scientists and scientists and contraceptive researchers to continue to look at us. And we want to do that because we&#8217;re all about science &#8212; we&#8217;re based on science. And I came to Clue because of that mission.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;For us it&#8217;s also an ability to keep doing more and more advanced things with the data, if you like,&#8221; adds Tin. &#8220;Which of course is important because people have many needs that if you are to answer them it has to be regulated. It&#8217;s right that they&#8217;re regulated. Now we learn how to operate as a regulated company &#8212; we </span><em style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">are</em><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> operating as a regulated company &#8212; that gives us an ability to keep meeting these needs that are deeper.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Walter also emphasizes the competitive advantage of being a consumer app that&#8217;s subject to regulatory surveillance as a medical device &#8212; in a sea of unregulated apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;A really important thing is that if you look at your average health and fitness app or whatever, their main KPI is let&#8217;s get a tonne of users through the door and make money off them. And I&#8217;m not going to say we don&#8217;t want a tonne of users through the door and to be profitable &#8212; we do want that. But because we are regulated we also have this post-market surveillance obligation that we will be audited on. That&#8217;s a KPI now. That&#8217;s not a nice to have. And I think that&#8217;s a big difference. And that&#8217;s something that consumers should think about when they&#8217;re using an app &#8212; like what KPIs are those people working to.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you might want to ask yourself what other apps is that developer putting out? Do they have 15 gaming apps and one period tracker? And what&#8217;s their business model?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who&#8217;s leading the company,&#8221; Brayboy chips in. &#8220;Look around this Zoom room you can see that we have all potentially had periods and continue to have them and so have had to make these decisions and so I think it puts us in a very unique position because we have a level of empathy and understanding that really comes from a personal space.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I wanted to say on the global health [potential] &#8212; I&#8217;m really excited about that. And that&#8217;s another of the reasons why I joined the company because I started my career in the Republic of Mali in West Africa and I saw how difficult it was for individuals to get contraception and a lot of things that are culturally pushed to people in those areas. And so this to me really represents an exciting prospect&#8230; I think there&#8217;s just limitless possibilities in other countries &#8212; we haven&#8217;t really thought about the cultural practices and the tendencies that people want to use something that is hormone free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about the new co-CEO structure, Tin says it&#8217;s a natural continuation of the collaborative leadership style she encouraged at Clue.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The big two things that Clue is going to care about is being a regulated company and building a sustainable business and I could&#8217;t think of two better people than Carrie and Audrey to mind these two parts of the business&#8230; We have had a very collaborative leadership style at Clue, always, because that&#8217;s how I like doing things &#8212; and it feels again also like an upgrade. Now two people get to do this in a pair and I think that&#8217;s a really great reflection of what I think is the future of leadership. </span>So on that level it&#8217;s also an expression of who we are to choose to have co-CEOs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re new at this but it&#8217;s been really fun the last couple of weeks but at the heart of it are these values of being disciplined about being transparent,&#8221; adds Tsang. &#8220;Being collaborative and being equal. And it allows us to hold each other accountable for all of those things which are at at the heart of Clue&#8217;s values. So I completely agree with Ida &#8212; I&#8217;d love to see more leadership look like this moving forward and I personally have been enjoying it quite a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;W</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ho needs another &#8216;hero CEO&#8217;,&#8221; adds Walter. &#8220;My starting point was that every conversation I have is actually better when Audrey&#8217;s in it &#8212; so let&#8217;s make my head conversations that way. Let&#8217;s upgrade the thinking process to a dialogue. And I think once you accept that most decisions are better made in some form of collaboration &#8212; let&#8217;s get real, right; we&#8217;re not that much of a genius that all of us don&#8217;t ever need to talk to other people &#8212; so once we accept that then the only question is how do you collaborate?</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As Ida said, we&#8217;ve always had a pretty collaborative management team but actually we found that &#8212; it&#8217;s like in the arts. Where are the most productive, most creative collaborations &#8212; they&#8217;re in really tight micro teams. And so let&#8217;s put that at the heart. And of course there&#8217;s a management team and of course there are other expertise and having Lynae in the company is wonderful and having the science component, and data science component, and all of this expertise, but I really like this generative heart of two. This dialogue as being the decision making process. There&#8217;s no reason to me why that wouldn&#8217;t make us more bold and more thoughtful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to second this and maybe it&#8217;s also worth saying that I founded Clue together with a bunch of great guys &#8212; one of them my life partner, and in a way we have, for many years, also been a very closed pair,&#8221; adds Tin. &#8220;And working on understanding equality and living from that place and now it&#8217;s, in a way, just an even more clear part of the structure. It&#8217;s like a good next step on something we&#8217;ve been learning about &#8212; basically since the beginning of Clue.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>This report was updated with a correction after Clue initially told us the high risk window &#8220;probably wouldn&#8217;t shorten to more than nine days&#8221;; they subsequently confirmed that this should be 11 days</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monday brings with it not one, but two space SPACS – there&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/">Rocket Lab</a>, and there&#8217;s Spire Global, a satellite operator that bills itself primarily as a SaaS company focused on delivering data and analytics made possible by its 100-plus spacecraft constellation. SPACs have essentially proven a pressure-release valve for the space startup market, which has been waiting on high-profile exits to basically prove out the math of its venture-backability.</p>
<p>Spire Global debuted in 2012, and has raised over $220 million to date. It will merge with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called NavSight Holdings, in order to make a debut on the NYSE under the ticker &#8216;SPIR.&#8217; The combined company will have a pro forma enterprise value of $1.6 billion upon transaction close, which is targeted for this summer.</p>
<p>The deal will provide $475 in funds for the company, including via a PIPE that includes Tiger Global, BlackRock and Hedosophia. Existing Spire stockholders will wind up with around 67% of the company after the businesses combine.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spire&#8217;s network of satellites is designed to provide customers with a &#8216;space-as-a-service&#8217; model, allowing them to operate their own payloads, and access data collected via an API their developers can integrate into their own software. The model is subscription-based, and is designed to get customers up and running with their own space-based data feed in less than a year from deal designs and commitment.</p>

<p>Existing investors in Spire Global include RRE Ventures, Promus Ventures, Seraphim Capital, Mitsui Global Investment and more, with its most recent round being a raised of debt financing. The company has launched satellites via Rocket Lab, its companion in the Monday SPAC news rush. The satellites it operates are small cube satellites, and it has launches on a wide range of launch vehicles, including SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9, the Russian Soyuz, ISRO&#8217;s PSLV, Japan&#8217;s H-2B, ULA rockets, Northrop Grumman&#8217;s Antares and even the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Spire got its start from very humble origins indeed – tracing all the way back to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space">Kickstarter campaign that was successful with just over $100,000 raised from backers</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Because news of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/"> its SPAC-fueled public market debut wasn&#8217;t enough</a>, Rocket Lab also unveiled a new class of rocket it has in development on Monday. The launch vehicle, called Neutron, will be able to carry 8 metric tons (around 18,000 lbs) to orbit, far exceeding the cargo capacity of Rocket Lab&#8217;s current Electron vehicle, which can host only around 660 lbs. Neutron will also have a fully reusable first-stage, designed to launch on an ocean landing platform, not unlike SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9 booster.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab says that Neutron will be designed to service increased demand from customers launching large multi-satellite constellations. The heavier lift will mean that it can take more small satellites up at one time to get those constellations in orbit more quickly. Its cargo rating also means it should be able to deliver up to 98% of all currently-forecasted spacecraft launching through 2029, according to Rocket Lab, and provide resupply services to the International Space Station. Rocket Lab also says it&#8217;ll be capable of human spaceflight missions, indicating an ambition to make it the company&#8217;s first human-rated spacecraft.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Neutron could significantly expand Rocket Lab&#8217;s customer base, and it&#8217;ll also improve costs and economics vs. what Electron can do now, thanks to a design focus don efficiency and reusability. The rocket will launch from Rocket Lab&#8217;s Wallops, Virginia facility, and since there&#8217;s already a launch pad in place for it, the company expects it&#8217;ll be able to fly Neutron for the first time by 2024. In addition to its LA-based HQ and the Wallops launch site, Rocket Lab anticipates it&#8217;ll be building a new Neutron production facility somewhere in the U.S. to build the new rocket at scale.</p>
<p>While it won&#8217;t have the launch capacity of SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9, it&#8217;s still intended to be a rocket that can also carry smaller payloads to the Moon and even deep space beyond. The medium-lift category in general is generating a lot of interest right now, given the projections in the amount and variety of constellations that both private and public organization are expected to put into orbit over the next decade. Constellations are offering advantages in terms of cost and coverage for everything from communications to Earth observation.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The SPAC run is on for space startups, which have been relatively slow in their overall exit pace before the current special purpose acquisitions company merger craze got underway. Rocket Lab is the latest, and likely the most notable to jump on the trend, with a deal that will see it <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210301005403/en/Rocket-Lab-an-End-to-End-Space-Company-and-Global-Leader-in-Launch-to-Become-Publicly-Traded-Through-Merger-with-Vector-Acquisition-Corporation">combine with a SPAC</a> called Vector and subsequently list on the NASDAQ under the ticker RKLB, with the transaction expected to close in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab, which got its start in New Zealand, and which still launches rockets there with its HQ now shifted to LA, will have a pro forma enterprise value of $4.1 billion via the transaction, with a total cash balance of $750 million once the deal goes through thanks to a PIPE of $470 million with funds invested via Vector, BlackRock and others. At close, existing Rocket Lab shareholders will retain 82% of the total equity in the combined company.</p>
<p>The launch company was founded in 2006, and is led by founder Peter Beck. In 2013, it opened its California headquarters, and it has already completed its first U.S. launch facility at Wallops Island, Virginia. The company&#8217;s Electron launch vehicle can carry small payloads to orbit, and is designed to cater to the growing small satellite market, with a focus on responsive and flexible launch options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Rocket Lab has performed launches on behalf of the U.S. government, including national security payloads, and that&#8217;s a key revenue opportunity for it gown forward. Currently, it says it has a backlog of customers, with a projection that it will be &#8216;EBITDA positive&#8217; in 2023 after adjustments, and fully cash-flow positive by 2024, with a projected run rate of over $1 billion in revenue by 2026.</p>
<p>The company has focused on increasing its ability to launch more frequently in a number of ways. It&#8217;s been steadily improving its production capacity, with a focus on its large automated carbon fiber production capabilities. It has also established its U.S. launch site, as mentioned, and will soon open its second launch pad at its existing New Zealand launch site, which is fully privately-owned by Rocket Lab itself. It&#8217;s also working on making its Electron vehicle partially reusable, which founder Beck says will help it turn around launches more quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, it also just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-debuts-plans-for-a-new-larger-reusable-rocket-for-launching-satellite-constellations/">announced a new heavier-lift launch vehicle called Neutron</a>, with a launch payload capacity of 8 tons – around 16,000 lbs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.klarna.com/">Klarna</a>, the Swedish buy now, pay later behemoth and upstart bank, has raised $1 billion in new funding at a post-money valuation of $31 billion. That sees the company retain the crown as the highest valued private fintech in Europe.</p>
<p>Backers of this round are said to be combination of new and existing investors, while Klarna claims it was 4 times oversubscribed. That&#8217;s likely prompted by reports the company is eyeing up a direct public listing and the current appetite for public tech stocks in general.</p>
<p>As a reference point, Affirm, which is viewed in the U.S. as one of Klarna&#8217;s most direct competitors, recently IPO&#8217;d. If you want further data points, read Alex&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">Extra Crunch analysis</a> of Klarna, Affirm and AfterPay&#8217;s most recent earnings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In addition to confirming the new fund raise &#8212; which had been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/klarna-to-raise-1-billion-at-31-billion-valuation.html">widely leaked</a> given that there dozens of frenzied investors involved &#8212; Klarna is also announcing that the company will pledge 1% of the capital raised to a newly created initiative that focuses on &#8220;key sustainability challenges around the world&#8221;. The initiative will be formally launched April 22 on World Earth Day.</p>
<p>A very early mover in what is now widely called buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), Klarna has been built on the concept of giving consumers a way to buy things online without having to pay for them upfront, and without resorting to a credit card. It does this both by offering online retailer integrations where Klarna appears as an option at check out, and through its own “shopping mall” app, where users can browse all the stores that let you pay with Klarna.</p>
<p>On the back of this, the company hopes to foster a bigger financial relationship with its users as a fully-fledged challenger bank. It has a range of licensed banking services, such as savings and current accounts, in Sweden <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/klarna-launches-bank-accounts-in-germany/">and Germany</a>, with more countries to follow.</p>
<p>On the BNPL front, Klarna is active in over 17 countries, and has over 250,000 retail partners including Macys, H&amp;M, IKEA, Expedia Group, Samsung, ASOS, Peloton, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Nike and AliExpress.</p>
<p>The fintech has been backed by Sequoia Capital since 2010. More recent investors include Dragoneer, Bestseller Group, Permira, Visa, Atomico, Ant Group, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Silver Lake, HMI Capital, TCV, Northzone, GIC (Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund) and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Klarna was founded all the way back in 2005 and has a fascinating story <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/">from startup to scale-up</a> &#8212; a story that almost certainly has a few more twists and turns yet.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Remote work has become the norm for many businesses in the last year, and today a startup that has built a cybersecurity platform to help manage all the devices connecting to organizations&#8217; wide-ranging networks &#8212; while also providing a way for those organizations to take advantage of all the best that the quite fragmented security market has to offer &#8212; is announcing a major round of funding and a big boost to its valuation after seeing its annual recurring revenues grow ten-fold over 15 months.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axonius</a>, which lets organizations manage and track computing-based assets that are connecting to their networks — and then plug that data into some 300 different cybersecurity tools to analyse it &#8212; has closed a round of $100 million, a Series D that values the company at over $1 billion ($1.2 billion, to be exact).</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We like to call ourselves the Toyota Camry of cybersecurity,” Axonius co-founder and CEO Dean Sysman told me in an interview last year. “It’s nothing exotic in a world of cutting-edge AI and advanced tech. However it’s a fundamental thing that people are struggling with, and it is what everyone needs. Just like the Camry.” It will be using the funding to continue scaling the company, it said, amid surging demand, with ARR growing to $10 million last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">This latest round &#8212; led by Stripes, with past investors Bessemer Venture Partners (BVP), OpenView, Lightspeed, and Vertex also participating &#8212; represents a huge jump for the startup.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not only is this the company&#8217;s biggest round to date, but last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$58 million Series C</a> &#8212; which closed just as the Covid-19 pandemic was kicking off and remote working, to better enforce social distancing, was starting to take off with it &#8212; valued the company at just over $302 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/185933-08/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. Axonius has now raised around $195 million in funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/bessemer-venture-partners-closes-on-3-3-billion-across-two-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BVP announced a new pair of funds totaling $3.3 billion</a>, with one dedicated to later stage growth rounds: this indicates that this money is already getting put to work. Amit Karp, the BVP partner who sits on Axonius&#8217; board, describes the startup as one of the &#8220;fastest-growing companies in BVP history.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I last covered Axonius, one of the details that really struck me is that its platform is especially useful in today&#8217;s market, not just because of its focus on identifying devices on networks may well &#8212; and today genuinely do &#8212; extend outside of a traditional &#8220;office&#8221;, but also because of how it views the cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s a very fragmented market today, with hundreds of companies all providing useful tools and techniques to safeguard against one threat or another. Axonius essentially accepts that fragmentation and works within it, and it has its job cut out for it. Last year when I covered the company&#8217;s funding, it integrated with and ran network assets through 100 different cybersecurity tools; now that number is 300.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The crux of what Axonius provides starts with a very basic but critical issue, which is being able to identify how many devices are actually on a network, where they are, and what they do there. The idea for the company came when Dean Sysman, the CEO who co-founded Axonius with Ofri Shur and Avidor Bartov, was previously working at another firm, the Integrity Project (now a <a href="https://www.mellanox.com/news/press_release/mellanox-technologies-ltd-announces-definitive-agreement-acquire-integrity-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part of Mellanox</a>, which means now it&#8217;s a part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/nvidia-to-buy-supercomputer-chipmaker-mellanox-for-6-9b-beating-intel-in-a-bidding-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia</a>).</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">“Every CIO I met I would ask, do you know how many devices you have on your network? And the answer was either ‘I don’t know,’ or big range, which is just another way of saying, ‘I don’t know,&#8217;” Sysman told me last year. “It’s not because they’re not doing their jobs but because it’s just a tough problem.”</p>
<p>He said part of the reason is because IP addresses are not precise enough, and de-duplicating and correlating numbers is a gargantuan task, especially in the current climate of people using not just a multitude of work-provided devices, but a number of their own.</p>
<p>Axonius&#8217;s algorithms &#8212; “a deterministic algorithm that knows and builds a unique set of identifiers that can be based on anything, including timestamp, or cloud information. We try to use every piece of data we can,&#8221; said Sysman &#8212; are built to bypass some of this.</p>
<p>The resulting information then can used across a number of other pieces of security software to search for inconsistencies in use (bringing in the behavioural aspect of cybersecurity) or other indicators of malicious activity.</p>
<p>The fact of that platform play &#8212; and how it can grow with both the range of devices that are added, as well as technology built to counteract increasingly sophisticated threats &#8212; is what attracted investors.<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;It’s always exciting to invest in fast-growing, innovative, category-creating companies, but what </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Axonius</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> has accomplished in such a short time is remarkable,&#8221; said Stripes founding partner Ken Fox in a statement. &#8220;With its commitment to solving a fundamental challenge with a simple, powerful platform that collects and correlates data from hundreds of products its customers already use, </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Axonius</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> has built one of the most beloved products in security. We look forward to partnering with the </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Axonius</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> team as they continue to invest in technical innovation and grow to meet global demand in 2021 and beyond.&#8221; Fox will join the <span class="il">Axonius</span> board of directors with this round.</span></p>
<p>It seems that some of this news leaked out over the weekend. A spokesperson has confirmed it all to us but the &#8220;official&#8221; announcement will be coming out later today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paytm, India’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">most valuable startup</a>, said on Monday it processed 1.2 billion transactions in the month of February, illustrating the level of penetration it has made in one of the world’s fastest-growing payments markets where it competes with Google, Facebook, Amazon, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/phonepe-raises-700-million-becomes-a-separate-entity/">Flipkart-backed PhonePe</a>.</p>
<p>Paytm said its users made 1.2 billion transactions last month across several payments modes including wallets, plastic cards, internet banking, and UPI. This is the largest volume of transactions reported by any payments firm in India and Paytm claimed that it has consolidated its leadership position.</p>
<p>A Paytm spokesperson told TechCrunch that the startup clocked over 1 billion transactions in the month of January as well. A PhonePe spokesperson told TechCrunch that its app crossed a billion transactions in December, and its last month&#8217;s transacting volume was “over a billion” across UPI, wallet, and credit and debit cards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paytm’s figure shows how the SoftBank-backed startup has continued to grow despite not being a dominant player in the UPI ecosystem.</p>
<p>A payments railroad built by a coalition of retail banks and backed by the government, UPI has emerged as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/walmarts-phonepe-zips-past-google-pay-in-india-as-upi-tops-2-billion-monthly-transactions/">most popular way users transact online in recent years</a> though it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">does not offer any business model</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, UPI services processed 2.29 billion transactions, the governing body NPCI said on Monday. PhonePe and Google Pay are the dominant UPI players in India, commanding over 85% of the person-to-person payments market. PhonePe processed about 970 million UPI transactions in February. (NPCI has said that it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/google-and-walmart-face-growth-hurdles-as-india-caps-payments-transactions/">enforce a market share cap</a> on its member firms.)</p>
<p>Unlike Paytm, which leads among wallet players, and PhonePe, Google Pay and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india/">relatively new entrant WhatsApp</a> solely operate on UPI.</p>
<p>Paytm has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/paytm-targets-merchants-to-fight-back-google-and-walmart-in-indias-crowded-payments-field/">expanded to cater to merchants</a> in recent years as several international firms launched their offerings to solve person-to-person payments in India. The startup claimed that its service dominates in offline merchant payments and is growing 15% month-on-month. The startup, led by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, said it serves over 17 million merchants. PhonePe told TechCrunch it serves over 17.5 million merchants.</p>
<p>Paytm said it has been “the main driving force behind building and expanding digital villages and now empowers over 6 lakh (600,000) villages in India with digital payments.” The startup said over 50% of its merchant partners have an account with Paytm Payments Bank &#8212; the startup’s digital bank &#8212; and it also commands the market with its digital wealth management service, Paytm Money.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s payments market that is estimated to be worth $1 trillion in the next three years, up from about $200 billion last year, according to Credit Suisse.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are humbled by the trust India has shown in us &amp; made Paytm their preferred digital payments &amp; financial service provider. We have consistently maintained industry-leading market share &amp; growing at an impressive rate,” said Narendra Yadav, Vice President of Paytm, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We have been promoting all digital payment methods giving multiple-choices to consumers that have helped us in consolidating our leadership position. In fact, a large percentage of our users who started their digital journey with Paytm, have now adopted &amp; embraced our financial services.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the back of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zynga acquiring Turkey&#8217;s Peak Games for $1.8 billion last year</a> and then following it up with <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201002005010/en/Zynga-Closes-Acquisition-of-Istanbul-Based-Rollic-a-Leader-in-the-Fast-Growing-Hyper-Casual-Games-Business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another gaming acquisition</a> in the country, Turkey has been making a name for itself as a hub for mobile gaming startups, and specifically those building casual puzzle games, the wildly popular and very sticky format that takes players through successive graphic challenges that test their logic, memory and ability to think under time pressure.</p>
<p>Today, one of the more promising of those startups, Istanbul-based, Peak alum-founded <a href="https://dreamgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dream Games</a>, is announcing the GA launch of its first title, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/royal-match/id1482155847#?platform=iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Royal Match</a> (on both iOS and Android), along with $50 million in funding to double down on the opportunity ahead &#8212; the largest Series A raised by a startup in Turkey to date.</p>
<p>While Dream Games will focus for the moment on building out the audience for puzzle games with more innovative ideas, it also has its sights set on a bigger goal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building this as an entertainment company,&#8221; CEO Soner Aydemir said in an interview, where he described Pixar as a key inspiration not just for size but for quality in its category. &#8220;What they did for animated movies, we want to do for mobile gaming. We are focusing on casual puzzle games first because everyone plays these, but we will also move forward with other genres. We want to be a huge interactive entertainment company that builds high quality games.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series A is being led by Index Ventures, with participation also from Balderton Capital and Makers Fund. The latter two backed Dream Games previously, in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/dream-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$7.5 million seed round in 2019</a>. Index, meanwhile, is a notable VC to have on board: other successful gaming startups it has backed include Discord, King, Roblox and Supercell.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is not Index&#8217;s first investment in a gaming startup founded by Peak Games alums: in December it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-12-02-bigger-games-raises-usd6-million-for-casual-puzzle-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led a $6 million round</a> for another Istanbul mobile casual puzzle gaming startup founded by ex-Peak employees: <a href="https://biggergames.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bigger Games</a>.</p>
<p>Dream Games is not disclosing its valuation with this round.</p>
<p>Dream Games raising $57.5 million ahead of launching any games &#8212; or proving whether they get any traction &#8212; may sound like a risky bet, but there is some context to the story that sets up the odds in this startup&#8217;s favor.</p>
<p>The founding team all come from Peak Games, the Istanbul gaming startup that was so nice, Zynga bought it twice &#8212; first, in the form of one small acquisition of some specific titles, and then the whole company some years later.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="X8jSdk2upV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/">Zynga acquires Turkey&#8217;s Peak Games for $1.8B, after buying its card games studio for $100M in 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zynga acquires Turkey&#8217;s Peak Games for $1.8B, after buying its card games studio for $100M in 2017&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/embed/#?secret=X8jSdk2upV" data-secret="X8jSdk2upV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>CEO Soner Aydemir is Peak&#8217;s former director of product who built the company&#8217;s two biggest hits, Toy Blast and Toon Blast. Ikbal Namli and Hakan Saglam were Peak&#8217;s former engineering leads. And Peak product manager Eren Sengul and an ex-Peak 3D artist Serdar Yilmaz round out the rest of the founding team.</p>
<p>(Aydemir notes that the team left and formed Dream Games in 2019, about a year before Zynga&#8217;s full acquisition.)</p>
<p>The other indicators that Dream Games is on to something are its metrics for its limited test run of Royal Match.</p>
<p>Royal Match &#8212; in which players are tasked with helping <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">King Robert restore his royal castle &#8220;to its former glory&#8221; by rebuilding it through a series of match-3 levels and obstacles, with new rooms, royal chambers and gardens making up the different levels of the game &#8212; was launched first as a limited test on iOS and Android in the U.K. and Canada in July leading up to this launch. In that time, Aydemir said it saw 1 million downloads and 200,000 daily average users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We think the numbers are very promising compared to previous experiences,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p>While Aydemir likes to describe Dream as an &#8220;entertainment&#8221; company, there is a lot of technology going into the product, from the graphics and the mechanics of the puzzles themselves through to the data science behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to create an iconic game, you need to combine engineering, art and data science together with high quality user acquisition and a strong marketing approach,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And he believes that when you focus on these it will inevitably lead to quality, which means you no longer have to focus on simply trying to find a hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t like that approach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don’t want to find a hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was also the mix that Index also wanted to back.</p>
<p>“Building iconic titles requires a harmonious mix of craft, science and flawless execution,&#8221; said Index Ventures partner Stephane Kurgan, who led the round together with Index’s Sofia Dolfe. &#8220;The Dream Games team has perfected this mix over many years of working together, and has put it on full display in Royal Match. We could not be more excited to work with them in their journey to build the next global casual champion.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Dream Games&#8217; long-term ambition is to build out interactive experiences around different audiences and genres, Aydemir said that casual games, and puzzles in particular, have proven to be a huge hit with consumers.</p>
<p>The strength of that trend has up to now meant that puzzle games generally have proven to have more staying power than other genres in mobile games, which have soared in popularity but also somewhat fizzled out.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Every year we see the bigger market of users growing by 20%,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will remain for decades.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Interestingly, the focus on casual gaming startups in Turkey seems like a perfect storm of sorts. Undeniably, the proven success of Peak has brought in more punters, but it has also shown the way to developers: you can build a successful and global consumer tech startup out of Turkey, and perhaps puzzles &#8212; which focus on shapes &#8212; are especially good at transcending different language barriers.. Alongside that, Aydemir pointed out that the country is strong on engineers and developers but slim on opportunities with bigger tech companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mobile gaming is a younger industry, so that presents an opportunity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><em>Updated to correct that Index is not an investor in Rovio, and that the limited test had 200,000, not 200, DAUs.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lime said Monday it has allocated $50 million towards its bike-share operation, an investment that has been used to develop a new ebike and will fund its expansion this year to another 25 cities in North America, Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. </span></p>
<p>If the company hits its goal, Lime&#8217;s bike-share service will be operational in 50 cities globally by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The latest generation e-bike, known internally as 6.0, has a <span style="font-weight: 400;">swappable battery that is interchangeable with Lime&#8217;s newest scooter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional upgrades to the e-bike include increased motor power, a phone holder, a new handlebar display, an electric lock that replaces the former generation&#8217;s cable lock and an automatic two-speed transmission. The new bikes are expected to launch and scale this summer. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The hardware upgrade builds off of the 5.8, a bike developed by Jump that was supposed to be deployed in 2020. That never happened at scale because Uber, which owned Jump, offloaded the unit to Lime as part of a complex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">$170 million investment round</a> announced in May.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump made great hardware,&#8221; Lime President Joe Kraus said in a recent interview. &#8220;And we made some further improvements on top with the new bike.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hardware upgrades and expansion were funded from its own operational funds, not new financing from outside investors, Kraus said. The funding was possible as<span style="font-weight: 400;"> a result of Lime achieving its first full quarter of profitability in 2020, according to the company.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have figured out how to be profitable and we are funding this,&#8221; Kraus said.</p>
<p>Lime not only added a new motor to the bike, it moved its location in an aim to make it easier to handle at low speeds and enough power to climb hills, Kraus said. The swappable battery was perhaps its most important upgrade directly tied to its drive towards profitability, Kraus added.</p>
<p>&#8220;When our operations teams is roaming around the city, they take can care of bikes and the scooter fleet, which allows us to both operate profitably and continue to have affordable pricing,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Lime&#8217;s investment in its ebike operation comes a month after it announced plans to add electric mopeds to its micromobility platform as the startup aims to own the spectrum of inner city travel from jaunts to the corner store to longer distance trips up to five miles. Lime is launching the effort by deploying 600 electric mopeds on its platform this spring in Washington D.C. The company is also working with officials to pilot the mopeds in Paris. Eventually, the mopeds will be offered in a “handful of cities” over the next several months.</p>
<p>&#8220;This idea of how to service more trips five miles within a city is part of why we continue to do multi modality,&#8221; Kraus said. &#8220;When we add a new modality like bikes into a scooter city, or when we add scooters to a bike city both modalities go up in usage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft is getting a new leader for its Greater China business. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yang-hou-4a5692b/">Yang Hou</a>, a former senior vice president at Qualcomm, will take over Alain Crozier as the chairman and chief executive officer for Microsoft Greater China Region, says a company <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/zh-cn/%e5%be%ae%e8%bd%af%e4%bb%bb%e5%91%bd%e4%be%af%e9%98%b3%e5%8d%9a%e5%a3%ab%e4%b8%ba%e5%a4%a7%e4%b8%ad%e5%8d%8e%e5%8c%ba%e8%91%a3%e4%ba%8b%e9%95%bf%e5%85%bc%e9%a6%96%e5%b8%ad%e6%89%a7%e8%a1%8c%e5%ae%98/">announcement</a> released Monday.</p>
<p>After eight years at Qualcomm where he led sales and business development, Hou will spearhead strategy, sales and operation for Microsoft in the Greater China region. Hou was credited for achieving 3X revenue growth for Qualcomm&#8217;s semiconductor business and fostering partnerships in the smartphone, industrial and automotive industries in China, according to the announcement.</p>
<p>A native of northeast China, Hou had a five-year stint at McKinsey &amp; Company after he graduated from the University of Michigan and Peking University.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Crozier joined Microsoft back in 1994 and will officially pass the torch to Hou in July. His next step is yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Crozier is resigning at a time when China is racing to outrace the U.S. as the global technology leader. The ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute has shaken the global supply chain, jacking up manufacturing costs for American hardware makers. Meanwhile, a number of legacy U.S. tech giants are scaling back their presence in China, where historically they have maintained research teams to better grasp the flourishing Chinese market.</p>
<p>In 2019, Oracle <a href="https://en.pingwest.com/a/1945">laid off</a> hundreds of staff at its R&amp;D center in China. Last year, IBM closed its R&amp;D center in China after 25 years in part due to increased labor costs, former employees told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Microsoft counterpart, Microsoft Research Asia, is widely respected and regarded as the &#8220;West Point&#8221; for China&#8217;s artificial intelligence scientists. Famed alumni include ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming and the founder of autonomous driving unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/momenta-profile/">Momenta</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to its fame in China&#8217;s tech industry, Microsoft&#8217;s revenue in China is modest as a result of rampant piracy and competition. In a 2018 <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/china-is-ripping-off-microsoft-to-the-tune-of-10b">interview</a>, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said 90% of companies in China were using the Microsoft operating system but only 1% were paying for it.</p>
<p>On the new business front, Microsoft has tried to peddle its Azure cloud computing product to Chinese enterprises but has so far been dwarfed by domestic players Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei.</p>
<p>China contributed less than 2% of Microsoft&#8217;s annual revenue, or around $2 billion, president Brad Smith <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-nadella-wades-into-u-s-china-tensions-in-tiktok-pursuit-11596569063">said</a> in January 2020.</p>
<p>Like other foreign tech firms operating in China, Microsoft is often caught in the middle between local authorities and speech advocates. Its professional social network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/linkedin-real-name-phone-number-verification-china/">LinkedIn</a> and search engine <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/microsoft-confirms-bing-is-down-in-china/">Bing</a> have both been criticized for censoring content considered sensitive by the Chinese government.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Skydio has raised $170 million in a Series D funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s Growth Fund. That pushes it into unicorn territory, with $340 million in total funding and a post-money valuation north of $1 billion. Skydio&#8217;s fresh capital comes on the heels of its expansion last year into the enterprise market, and it intends to use the considerable pile of cash to help it expand globally and accelerate product development.</p>
<p>In July of last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/autonomous-drone-startup-skydio-rises-100-million-and-launches-the-x2-commercial-drone/">Skydio announced its $100 million Series C financing</a>, and also debuted the X2, its first dedicated enterprise drone. The company also launched a suite of software for commercial and enterprise customers, its first departure from the consumer drone market where it had been focused prior to that raise since its founding in 2014.</p>
<p>Skydio&#8217;s debut drone, the R1, received a lot of accolades and praise for its autonomous capabilities. Unlike other consumer drones at the time, including from recreational drone maker DJI, the R1 could track a target and film them while avoiding obstacles without any human intervention required. Skydio then released the Skydio 2 in 2019, its second drone, cutting off more than half the price while improving on it its autonomous tracking and video capabilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Late last year, Skydio brought on additional senior talent to help it address enterprise and government customers, including a software development lead who had experience at Tesla and 3D printing company Carbon. Skydio also hired two Samsara executives at the same time to work on product and engineering. Samsara provides a platform for managing cloud-based fleet operations for large enterprises.</p>
<p>The applications of Skydio&#8217;s technology for commercial, public sector and enterprise organizations are many and varied. Already, the company works with public utilities, fire departments, construction firms and more to do work including remote inspection, emergency response, urban planning and more. Skydio&#8217;s U.S. pedigree also puts it in prime position to capitalize on the growing interest in applications from the defense sector.</p>
<p>a16z previously led Skydio&#8217;s Series A round. Other investors who participated in this Series D include Lines Capital, Next47, IVP and UP.Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese space startup <a href="https://gitai.tech/en/">Gitai</a> has raised a $17.1 million funding round, a Series B financing for the robotics startup. This new funding will be used for hiring, as well as funding the development and execution of an on-orbit demonstration mission for the company&#8217;s robotic technology, which will show its efficacy in performing in-space satellite servicing work. That mission is currently set to take place in 2023.</p>
<p>Gitai will also be staffing up in the U.S., specifically, as it seeks to expand its stateside presence in a bid to attract more business from that market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proceeding well in the Japanese market, and we&#8217;ve already contracted missions from Japanese companies, but we haven&#8217;t expanded to the U.S. market yet,&#8221; explained Gitai founder and CEO Sho Nakanose in an interview. So we would like to get missions from U.S. commercial space companies, as a subcontractor first. We&#8217;re especially interested in on-orbit servicing, and we would like to provide general-purpose robotic solutions for an orbital service provider in the U.S.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nakanose told me that Gitai has plenty of experience under its belt developing robots which are specifically able to install hardware on satellites on-orbit, which could potentially be useful for upgrading existing satellites and constellations with new capabilities, for changing out batteries to keep satellites operational beyond their service life, or for repairing satellites if they should malfunction.</p>
<p>Gitai&#8217;s focus isn&#8217;t exclusively on extra-vehicular activity in the vacuum of space, however. It&#8217;s also performing a demonstration mission of its technical capabilities in partnership with Nanoracks using the Bishop Airlock, which is the first permanent commercial addition to the International Space Station. Gitai&#8217;s robot, codenamed S1, is an arm&#8211;style robot not unlike industrial robots here on Earth, and it&#8217;ll be showing off a number of its capabilities, including operating a control panel and changing out cables.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/336qeBxN-Bk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Long-term, Gitai&#8217;s goal is to create a robotic workforce that can assist with establishing bases and colonies on the Moon and Mars, as well as in orbit. With NASA&#8217;s plans to build a more permanent research presence on orbit at the Moon, as well as on the surface, with the eventual goal of reaching Mars, and private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin looking ahead to more permanent colonies on Mars, as well as large in-space habitats hosting humans as well as commercial activity, Nakanose suggests that there&#8217;s going to be ample need for low-cost, efficient robotic labor – particularly in environments that are inhospitable to human life.</p>
<p>Nakanose told me that he actually got started with Gitai after the loss of his mother – an unfortunate passing he said he firmly believes could have been avoided with the aid of robotic intervention. He began developing robots that could expand and augment human capability, and then researched what was likely the most useful and needed application of this technology from a commercial perspective. That research led Nakanose to conclude that space was the best long-term opportunity for a new robotics startup, and Gitai was born.</p>
<p>This funding was led by SPARX Innovation for the Future Co. Ltd, and includes funding form DcI Venture Growth Fund, the Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, and EP-GB (Epson&#8217;s venture investment arm).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It may be tough to remember, but there was a time long ago when Justworks wasn&#8217;t a household name. Though its monthly revenue growth charts were up and to the right, it had not even broken the $100,000 mark. Even then, Bain Capital Venture&#8217;s Matt Harris felt confident in betting on the startup.</p>
<p>Harris says that, with any investment (particularly at the early stage of a company), the decision really comes down to the team and more importantly, the founder.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Two of the main reasons this deck &#8220;sings&#8221; is the line it draws to the Justworks culture and that the deck isn&#8217;t &#8220;artificially simple.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;Isaac is a long-term mercenary, but short- and medium-term missionary,&#8221; said Harris. &#8220;The word that really comes to mind is &#8216;structured.&#8217; If you ask him to think about something and respond, he&#8217;ll think about it and come back with an answer that has four pillars underneath it. He&#8217;ll create a framework that not only answers your specific question, but can prove to be a model that will answer future questions of the same type. He&#8217;s a systems thinker.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2015, Justworks closed its $13 million Series B, led by Bain Capital Ventures. Harris took a seat on the board. Since, the duo have been working closely together as Justworks has grown into the behemoth it is today.</p>
<p>But these relationships work both ways. Oates said that one of the main things he looks for in an investor is how they&#8217;ll react when the chips are down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Different people behave different ways under stress,&#8221; said Oates. &#8220;And people show their values and integrity in those types of situations. That&#8217;s when these things are tested. The simple way I think about this is, will this person pick me up from the airport in a pinch?&#8221;</p>
<p>Though he&#8217;s never asked, he believes Harris absolutely would.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, Harris and Justworks CEO Isaac Oates sat down to talk through how they resolve disagreements, why Oates never changed what must be one of the most simple pitch decks I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life, and how founders should think about pricing their products.</p>
<p>They also gave live feedback on pitch decks submitted by the audience in the Pitch Deck Teardown. (If you’d like to see your deck featured on a future episode, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">send it to us using this form.</a>)</p>
<p>We record Extra Crunch Live every Wednesday at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST/8 p.m. GMT. You can see our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">past episodes here</a> and check out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/check-out-the-incredible-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-march/">March slate right here</a>.</p>
<h2>Episode breakdown</h2>
<ul>
<li>Working through disagreements — 11:30</li>
<li>The Justworks Series B Deck — 15:00</li>
<li>Pricing the product — 25:00</li>
<li>Pitch deck teardown — 33:00</li>
</ul>
<h2>Working through disagreements</h2>
<p>Despite their glowing praise of one another at the top of the episode, the founder/investor duo haven&#8217;t always seen eye to eye. But they did provide an excellent framework around how founders and VCs should wade through disagreements around the business.</p>
<p>Oates gave an example from 2017. He was considering putting in a dual-class stock, which would give a kind of high-vote, low-vote structure to the company. He said that it interested him because he&#8217;d seen other companies out there who were vulnerable after going public, whether it be activist shareholders or other outside forces, and that that might prevent a CEO from thinking about the long term.</p>
<p>Harris disagreed and gave a long list of reasons why that neither shared on the episode. However, Oates said that one of the great things to come out of that disagreement was seeing how Harris went about this decision.</p>
<p>Harris introduced Oates to every expert on this particular subject that he knew, asking them to have meetings and discuss it further.</p>
<p>In the end, Oates ultimately stuck to his guns and decided to go forward with the dual-class stock, but armed with all the information he needed to feel confident in the decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned a lot about how Matt thinks and how he approaches decisions,&#8221; said Oates. &#8220;The process of making decisions is just as important as the content. As I&#8217;ve gotten to know him more, it means that when we find something where we don&#8217;t necessarily agree, we&#8217;re able to step back and make sure we have an intellectually rigorous way to process it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The story reminded me of a similar conversation with Ironclad CEO Jason Boehmig and Accel&#8217;s Steve Loughlin. They explained how much time and energy they spent early on in their investor/founder relationship talking about the &#8220;why&#8221; behind opinions and strategies and decisions, plotting out the short-, medium- and long-term plan for the company.</p>

<p>“I want to know what you want the company to look like so that I can push you and we can have constructive conversations around the plan,” said Loughlin. “That way, I’m not getting a phone call about whether or not they should hire a head of customer success without any context or a true north in mind.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p><em>Kicking off with a tiny bit of housekeeping: Equity is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/the-equity-podcast-is-getting-bigger-and-better/">now doing more stuff</a>. And TechCrunch has its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">Justice</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">Early-Stage</a> events coming up. I am <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/were-talking-startup-sales-with-zoom-cro-ryan-azus-at-techcrunch-early-stage/">interviewing the CRO of Zoom</a> for the latter. And The Exchange itself has some long-overdue stuff coming next week, including $50M and $100M ARR updates (Druva, etc.), a peek at consumption based pricing vs. traditional SaaS models (featuring Fastly, Appian, BigCommerce CEOs, etc.), and more. Woo! </em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week both DoorDash and Airbnb reported earnings for the first time as public companies, marking their real graduation into the ranks of the exited unicorns. We’re keeping our usual eye on the earnings cycle, quietly, but today we have some learnings for the startup world.</p>
<p>Some basics will help us get started. DoorDash <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/doordash-dash-q4-2020-earnings.html">beat growth expectations</a> in Q4, reporting revenue of $970 million versus an expected $938 million. The gap between the two likely comes partially from how new the DoorDash stock is, and the pandemic making it difficult to forecast. Despite the outsized growth, DoorDash shares initially fell sharply after the report, though they largely recovered on Friday.</p>
<p>Why the initial dip? I reckon the company’s net loss was larger than investors hoped &#8212; though a large GAAP deficit is standard for first quarters post-debut. That concern might have been tempered by the company’s <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/25/doordash-inc-dash-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript/">earnings call</a>, which included a note from the company’s CFO that it is “seeing acceleration in January relative to our order growth in December as well as in Q4.” That’s encouraging. On the flip side, the company’s CFO did say “starting from Q2 onwards, we&#8217;re going to see a reversion toward pre-COVID behavior within the customer base.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Qf9D2lL5OD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/">How COVID-19 accelerated DoorDash&#8217;s business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How COVID-19 accelerated DoorDash&#8217;s business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/how-covid-19-accelerated-doordashs-business/embed/#?secret=Qf9D2lL5OD" data-secret="Qf9D2lL5OD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Big companies are anticipating a return to pre-COVID behavior, just not quite yet. Firms that benefited from COVID-19 are being heavily scrutinized. And they expect tailwinds to fade as the year progresses.</p>
<p>And then there’s Airbnb, which is up around 16% today. Why? It <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/airbnb-abnb-earnings-q4-2020.html">beat revenue expectations</a>, while also losing lots of money. Airbnb’s net loss in Q4 2020 was more than 10x DoorDash’s own. So why did Airbnb get a bump while DoorDash got dinged? Its large revenue beat ($859 million, instead of an expected $748 million), and potential for future growth; investors are expecting that Airbnb’s current besting of expectations will lead to even <em>more</em> growth down the road.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Provided that you have a good story to tell regarding future growth, investors are still willing to accept sharp losses; the growth trade is alive, then, even as companies that may have already received a boost endure increased scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>For startups, valuation <em>pressure</em> or <em>lift</em> could come down to which side of the pandemic they are on</strong>; are they on the tail end of their tailwind (remote-work focused SaaS, perhaps?), or on the ascent (restaurant tech, maybe?). Something to chew on before you raise.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>It was one blistering week for funding rounds. Crunchbase News, my former journalistic home, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/yes-2021-is-shaping-up-as-a-wild-year-for-supergiant-rounds-we-break-down-where-the-money-is-going/">has a great piece out</a> on just how many massive rounds we’re seeing so far this year. But even one or two steps down in scale, funding activity was super busy.</p>
<p>A few rounds that I could not get to this week that caught my eye included a <a href="https://terminus.com/">$90 million round for Terminus</a> (ABM-focused GTM juicer, I suppose), <a href="https://anchorage.com/">Anchorage’s $80 million Series C</a> (cryptostorage for big money), and <a href="https://foxtrotco.com/">Foxtrot Market’s $42 million Series B</a> (rapid delivery of yuppie and zoomer essentials).</p>
<p>Sitting here now, finally writing a tidbit about each, I am reminded at the sheer breadth of the tech market. Termius helps other companies sell, Anchorage wants to keep your ETH safe, while Foxtrot wants to help you replenish your breakfast rosé stock before you have to endure a dry morning. What a <em>mix</em>. And each must be generating venture-acceptable growth, as they have not merely raised more capital but raised rather large rounds for their purported maturity (measured by their listed Series stage, though the moniker can be more canard than guide.)</p>

<p>I jokingly call this little section of the newsletter Market Notes, a jest as how can you possibly note the whole market that we care about? These companies and their recent capital infusions underscore the point.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>Finally, two notes from earnings calls. The first from Root, which is a head scratcher, and the second from Booking Holdings’ results.</p>
<p>I chatted with Alex Timm, Root Insurance’s CEO this week moments after it <a href="https://ir.joinroot.com/static-files/a815dec9-e8fb-435b-9ab8-b422d4f773ca">dropped numbers</a>. As such I didn’t have much context in the way of investor response to its results. My read was that Root was super capitalized, and has pretty big expansion plans. Timm was upbeat about his company’s improving economics (on a loss ratio and loss-adjusted expenses basis, for the insurtech fans out there), and growth during the pandemic.</p>
<p>But then today its shares are off 16%. Parsing the analyst call, there’s movement in Root’s economic profile (regarding premium-ceding variance over the coming quarters) that make it hard to fully grok its full-year growth from where I sit. But it <em>appears</em> that Root’s business is still molting to a degree that is almost refreshing; the company could have gone public in 2022 with some of its current evolution behind it, but instead it raised a zillion dollars last year and is public now.</p>
<p>Sticking our neck out a bit, despite fellow neo-insurnace player Lemonade’s continued, and impressive valuation run, MetroMile’s stock is also softening, while Root’s has lost more than half its value from its IPO date. If the current repricing of some neo-insurance players continues, we could see some private investment into the space slow. (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/hippo-insurance-convertible-note--07be969a">Fewer things like this?</a>) It’s a possible trend we’ll have eyes on this year.</p>
<p>Next, Booking Holdings, the company that owns Priceline and other travel properties. Given that Booking might have notes regarding the future of business travel &#8212; which we care about for clues regarding what could come for remote work and office culture, things that impact everything from startup hub locations to software sales &#8212; The Exchange snagged a call slot and dialed the company up.</p>
<p>Booking Holdings’ CEO Glenn Fogel didn’t have a comment as to how his company is trading at all-time highs despite suffering from sharp year-over-year revenue declines. He did note that the pandemic has shaken up expectations for conversations, which could limit short-term business travel in the future for meetings that may now be conducted on video calls. He was bullish on future conference travel (good news for TechCrunch, I suppose), and future travel more generally.</p>
<p>So concerning the jetting perspective, we don’t know anything yet. Booking Holdings is not saying much, perhaps because it just doesn’t know when things will turn around. Fair enough. Perhaps after another three months of vaccine rollout will give us a better window into what a partial return to an old normal could look like.</p>
<p>And to cap off, you can read Apex Holdings’ SPAC presentation <a href="https://www.apexclearing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apex-Northern-Star-Investor-Presentation-02222021.pdf">here</a>, and Markforged’s <a href="https://static.markforged.com/downloads/Markforged+Investor+Presentation.pdf">here</a>. Also I wrote about the buy-now-pay-later space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">here</a>, riffed on the Digital Ocean IPO with Ron Miller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/digitaloceans-ipo-filing-shows-a-two-class-cloud-market/">here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/understanding-toasts-expected-ipo-through-the-lens-of-olos-2020-results/">doodled on Toast’s valuation and the Olo debut here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“A lot of founders mix up raising money with making money.&#8221;</p>
<p>This quote, which Career Karma founder Ruben Harris mentioned off-hand on a phone call with me, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1285998617266753539">on my mind</a> for months. In fact, raising money can cost you money, in the form of that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/08/lemonade-ipo-dilution/">sweet, sweet ownership</a> and equity.</p>
<p>That’s why Clearbanc, a startup I have covered for years, has always had a compelling pitch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, co-founded by Michele Romanow and Andrew D’Souza, positions itself as an alternative equity-free capital solution for early-stage founders. Flexing its “20-minute term sheet” the startup uses an algorithm to shift through a startup’s data, and if it has positive ad spend and positive unit economics, they make an investment worth anything from $10,000 to over $10 million. It makes money through a revenue-share agreement versus an equity stake.</p>
<p>“While we’ve invested in over 4,000 businesses using this model, we’ve also turned away over 50,000 who weren’t at this scale or level of repeatability,” D’Souza tells TechCrunch. So, the startup told me this week that they have raised $10 million to create a new product: ClearAngel.</p>
<p>The startup is trying to back anyone with an online business that has early revenue, but pre-broad traction. Clearbanc wants to replace friends and family money, a concept that D’Souza says is “quite elitist,” with its own version of an angel check, while also offering founder services such as supply chain analysis, introductions to networks and competitive landscape analysis.</p>
<p>The startup just needs to make around $1,000 in monthly revenue to qualify for cash. In return for an investment between $10,000 to $50,000, founders have to pay up to 2% of their revenue over four years.</p>
<p>Clearbanc’s repayment works for some startups, but for others, a traditional bank loan could work better. Its biggest hurdle, I’d argue, is that if a startup has great revenue already, you might not want to take a revenue-share agreement loan.</p>
<p>As for if a startup takes ClearAngel capital and doesn’t make the minimum revenue?</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the ClearAngel product isn’t working,” he said. “There are bound to be some companies who still can’t make it, that’s the risk we take.”</p>
<p>Alternative capital has pros and cons, just like venture capital has pros and cons. If the end goal is to become a billion-dollar business, what’s the best route to do that? Is taking a revenue-share agreement going to hurt your chances as a pre-seed startup trying to raise capital? Does YC care at all?</p>
<p>Those are some of my biggest questions, and we’ll explore all (and more!) in my alternative financing panel next week for TC Sessions: Justice. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/register-for-tc-sessions-justice-for-a-conversation-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-the-startup-world/">It costs $5 to attend the entire conference,</a> and speakers include Backstage Capital’s Arlan Hamilton and Congresswoman Barbara Lee.</p>

<h2><strong>Coinbase files to go public</strong></h2>
<p>After being valued at $100 billion in the secondary markets, Coinbase has finally filed to go public. The S-1, as Winnie founder Sara Mauskopf tweeted, is<a href="https://twitter.com/sm/status/1364976889434050560"> #goals. </a>The crypto unicorn, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/coinbase-files-to-go-public-in-a-key-listing-for-the-cryptocurrency-category/">my colleague Alex Wilhelm notes</a>, grew just over 139% in 2020, a massive improvement on its 2019 results.</p>

<h2><strong>Mobility-as-a-service </strong></h2>
<p>I caught up with Eric Eldon, managing editor at TechCrunch and former Startups Weekly writer, about the recent work he’s been doing with Kirsten Korosec, our transportation editor.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what he had to say:</strong> Startup employees may not be going into the office as often again — or ever. But everyone will still need to go places, or at least want to! How will they do it? What will we do? How will our altered set of needs and wants reshape cities, right as new technologies are fundamentally altering transportation, too? We’re going to be covering this topic in-depth this year, as we all figure out how to go back to work.</p>

<h2><strong>Spain wants startups to succeed on its soil</strong></h2>
<p>The Spanish government, led by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, has announced plans to turn itself into an entrepreneurial nation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/spains-ten-year-plan-to-put-startups-in-the-economic-driving-seat/">The Startup Act</a> is the first piece of dedicated legislation meant to help create tech innovation within Spain.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.stormventures.com/our-team/">Storm Ventures</a>, a venture firm that focuses on early stage B2B enterprise startups, announced this week that it has promoted Pascale Diaine and Frederik Groce to partners at the firm.</p>
<p>The two new partners have worked their way up over the last several years. Groce joined Storm in 2016 and has invested in enterprise SaaS startups like Workato, Splashtop, NextRequest and Camino. Diaine joined a year later and has invested in firms like Sendoso, German Bionic, InEvent and Talkdesk.</p>
<p>Groce, who is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/blck-vc-launches-educational-initiative-to-bring-more-blacks-into-investing-ecosystem/">a founder at BLCK VC</a> and helped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/blck-vc-launches-educational-initiative-to-bring-more-blacks-into-investing-ecosystem/">organize the Black Venture Institute</a> to create a network of Black investors, says that these promotions show that venture needs to be more diverse, and Storm recognizes this.  &#8220;If you think about the way our team works, that&#8217;s the way I think venture teams will need to work to be able to be successful in the next 40 years. And so the hope is that over time everyone does this and we&#8217;re just early to it,&#8221; Groce told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, right now that&#8217;s not the case, not even close. According <a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/business-investment-to-women/#:~:text=Only%2012%20percent%20of%20venture,t%20have%20any%20female%20partners.">to research by Crunchbase</a>, just 12% of venture capitalists are women and two-thirds of firms don&#8217;t have any female investors. Meanwhile, only about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/venture-capital-2020-still-really-white/#:~:text=As%20of%20now%2C%20only%20about,one%20person%20and%20it's%20done.">4% of ventures investors</a> are Black.</p>
<p>Those numbers have an impact on the number of Black and female founders because as Groce points out the lack of founders in underrepresented groups is in part a networking problem. &#8220;In a business that&#8217;s predicated on networks if you don&#8217;t have diversity in the network, or the teams that are driving those networks, you just can&#8217;t make sure you&#8217;re seeing great talent across all ecosystems,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Diaine, who is French and started her career by founding Orange Fab, the corporate accelerator of the European Telco Orange, has brought her international<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> business background to Storm where they helped her tune that experience to an investor focus and supported her as she learned the nuances of the investment side of the business.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t come from the VC world. I come from the innovative corporate world. So they had to train me and spend time getting me up to date. And they did spend so much time making sure I understood everything to make sure I got to this level,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Both partners bring their own unique views looking beyond Silicon Valley for investment opportunities. Diaine&#8217;s investment include a German, Brazilian and Portuguese company, while Groce&#8217;s investments include companies in Chicago, Atlanta and Seattle.</p>
<p>The two partners have also developed an algorithm to help find investments based on a number of online signals, something that has become more important during the pandemic when they couldn&#8217;t network in person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frederik and I have been working on [an algorithm to find] what are the signals that you can identify online that will tell you this company&#8217;s doing well, this company growing.You have to have a nice set of startup search tracking [signals], but what do you track if you can&#8217;t just get the revenue in real time, which is impossible. So we&#8217;ve developed an algorithm that helps us identify some of these signals and create alerts on which startups we should pay attention to,&#8221; Diaine explained.</p>
<p>She says this data-driven approach should be helpful and augment their in-person efforts even after the pandemic is over and increase their overall efficiency in finding and tracking companies in their portfolios.</p>
