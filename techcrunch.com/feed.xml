										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that enables businesses to set up and manage their billing, subscription, revenue operations and compliance has become the newest firm to earn the much coveted unicorn status.</p>
<p>Chennai and San Francisco-headquartered <a href="https://www.chargebee.com/">Chargebee</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $125 million in its Series G financing round led by Sapphire Ventures and existing investors Tiger Global and Insight Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The new financing round valued the 10-year-old startup at $1.4 billion, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/chargebee-raises-55-million-to-help-businesses-move-to-subscriptions/">3x increase since the Series F round six months ago</a>. Some other existing investors also participated in the new round, said Chargebee, which has raised $230 million to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you’re a business, setting up and managing a subscription service &#8212; to ensure recurring revenue &#8212; could prove to be a complex process. You may want to offer a free 30-day trial to new potential customers. What if some customers want to move to a different pricing tier? These are some of the problems Chargebee is equipped to handle.</p>
<p>Chargebee helps individuals, small and medium-sized businesses and enterprises set up, manage, and automate subscriptions, billing, invoicing, and payments.</p>
<p>One of the key strengths of Chargebee is that it can help even large enterprises move to a subscription model within 10 days.</p>
<p>The industry is going through a “significant change” with businesses digitally transforming themselves and moving to the SaaS model, Krish Subramanian, co-founder and chief executive of Chargebee, told TechCrunch in an interview. And it’s this change that has made Chargebee so vital to thousands of companies today.</p>
<p>Chargebee was founded in an apartment in Chennai, a city on India’s southeastern coast. Subramanian has credited reading blog posts by Joel Spolsky, founder of Trello, as an early inspiration to start his own venture.</p>
<p>“He was solving a very boring problem but in very interesting ways, and he used to share the story of how he is building a company,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AdVoF9XjhU">said in an earlier interview</a>. “That was my inspiration that I should start my company like that. So while working at other companies we saved enough and acquired skills to start this.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tiger Global goes super aggressive in India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/embed/#?secret=kTdTf3Etnw" data-secret="kTdTf3Etnw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup’s offerings today are not limited to just billing. It also helps businesses plug revenue leakage, increase customer loyalty, expand into new categories with the backend ready, and experiment with pricing plans &#8212; introducing and removing them within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>It supports over 100 currencies, and dozens of popular payment gateways, including Stripe, Braintree, WorldPay and PayPal, and its global tax management coverage also helps businesses to expand to new markets. MakeSpace, an on-demand storage company, used Chargebee’s services to scale from four markets to 31 in one year, for instance.</p>
<p>The startup has amassed over 2,500 customers, most of whom are based in the U.S. and Europe. Some of these customers include brands such as cloud software Okta, business software firm Freshworks, calendar invites manager Calendly, training platform Linux Academy, and Japanese tech giant Fujitsu.</p>
<p>Subramanian said Chargebee’s revenue has doubled in the past 12 months and customer’s revenue has grown by 125%, though he didn’t disclose figures.</p>
<p>He said that like other businesses, Chargebee has been cautiously navigating the global pandemic. The fundraise six months ago ensured that the startup had enough capital in the bank to operate comfortably, he said.</p>
<p>But the recent growth Chargebee has seen prompted the startup to grow more aggressive. “There’s a window of opportunity for the next five years for us to build out this category beautifully and serve a lot of customers,” he said. “And that’s what led the startup to explore the new financing round, he said, adding that the fact that the cost of capital is lower currently in the market also played a role.</p>
<p>“As the global shift to subscription-first models continue to grow in popularity, Chargebee has an incredibly bold vision for new products for multiple market segments,” said Rajeev Dham, Partner at Sapphire Ventures, in a statement. “After years of knowing them, I’ve been most impressed by their thoughtfulness and execution in building Chargebee as the emerging category leader that is reinventing the broader space.”</p>
<p>Chargebee will deploy the fresh capital to expand its suite of products and work on new capabilities to help enterprises in even more ways.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement comes at a time when a slice of Indian startups are raising large amounts of capital at a much more frequent pace and at increased valuations as investors double down on promising bets in the world’s second-largest internet market. Chargebee is the seventh Indian startup to turn a unicorn this month, and 11th this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FoodTech industry is effectively now going into fast food. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sweetgreen">Sweetgreen</a> in the US is a &#8216;fast-casual&#8217; restaurant chain that serves healthy “bowl food”. It’s raised $478.6M. A similar firm is Sweetfin. Both employ a lot of tech in their back-end to improve efficiencies.</p>
<p>Into this area has come European startup <a href="https://pokehouse.it">Poke House</a>, which is effectively industrializing the production of “poke bowls” for food delivery platforms. Poke House specializes in bowl food that often includes marinated fish that&#8217;s cubed and layered up with sticky rice, pickles, noodles, etc.</p>
<p>The company has now raised €20 million ($24m) in a Series B funding round led by Eulero Capital, with the backing of FG2 Capital and reinvestment from Milan Investment Partners SGR. It using tech and data to optimize the production and delivery of its product via all the major food delivery platforms such as Uber East etc. The Italy-born food tech startup claims to have built a &#8220;€100M+ company&#8221; inside two years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Matteo Pichi and Vittoria Zanetti, Poke House has opened 30+ stores in Italy, Portugal and Spain, and now has 400 employees. It’s claiming an expected turnover of €40M+ in 2021.</p>
<p>With the funding, the startup will start opening new stores in existing markets, enter France and start in expansion in the UK.</p>
<p>Poke House says it uses a lot of tech on its back-end, tracking every element of the supply chain to optimize the business. It also analyzes data from third-party delivery platforms (ie. Deliveroo, Glovo, UberEats) to deliver a sub-10 mins food preparation time, and a delivery time under 25 mins.</p>
<p>Matteo Pichi, Co-Founder of Poke House said: “The pandemic has challenged our food sector, and we see technology as the way forward to innovate and digitalize the traditional restaurant experience. We are seeing a shift in people&#8217;s desires in fast but healthy food. Poke bowls fit this new need and it promotes a more balanced, active and sustainable lifestyle with quick and healthy food options available nearby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Pichi added: “Our competitors are the fast-growing healthy concepts such as Sweetgreen or Sweetfin in the US. But in the same time, we think we are lucky because we really are one of the first brands built 100% from food delivery experts or former employees. Our next competitors are gonna be full native virtual brands extremely strong in data analysis and digital brand building. We use food delivery platforms as media platforms and we invest heavier than competitors in the channel.”</p>
<p>Gianfranco Burei, Founding Partner of Eulero Capital said: “Poke House business model rides some of the main trends in the food sector (food-tech, healthy food, delivery, customization) and has all the characteristics and talents to position the company among the top players at European level. We are thrilled to be a partner of Poke House in an innovative and forward-looking project, in line with our investment strategy which is based on the search for companies included in the macro-trends that will characterize the economic, technological and social evolution of the coming years.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given the go ahead to local startup <a href="https://www.sees.ai">sees.ai,</a> which is developing a beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) command &amp; control solution to aid data capture for industrial use-cases, to trial a concept for routine BVLOS operations &#8212; the first such authorization for a U.K. company, the regulator <a href="https://www.caa.co.uk/News/Step-forward-for-the-drone-industry-as--Civil-Aviation-Authority-authorises-trial-of-a-concept--for-routine-BVLOS-operations/">said today</a>.</p>
<p>The test is taking place under a sandbox program announced back in May 2019 &#8212; directing government funding and regulatory support to R&amp;D in the drone space &#8212; initially through virtual testing, such as of avoid and detect systems.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Sees.ai,</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an early participant in the sandbox, has now secured authorization to trial a concept for routine BVLOS operations at three (physical) sites without needing to pre-authorise each flight. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxS-m_ti73g">Techstars-backed </a>startup is focused on drone operations in industrial settings &#8212; building tech to scale the use of drones for inspection and maintenance purposes in industries, such as the oil &amp; gas sector, by enabling pilots to remote-control craft from a central location, rather than needing to be on site for each flight.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s clear BVLOS capabilities will be essential for other uses of drone tech &#8212; such as delivery &#8212; hence the CAA calling the trial &#8220;a significant step forward for the drone industry&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;By testing the concept in industrial environments for inspection, monitoring and maintenance purposes, sees.ai aims to prove the safety of its system within this context initially, before extending it to address increasingly challenging missions over time,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Under current U.K. rules, drone operators must keep their aircraft within line of sight and follow the country&#8217;s <a href="https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/drone-code">drone code</a> &#8212; unless they have specific permissions to do otherwise.</p>
<p>One company that previously gained such permission was U.S. tech giant Amazon &#8212; which started testing BVLOS delivery drones in the UK back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/amazons-prime-air-delivery-uk/">2016</a> &#8212; and continues to work on bringing a commercial drone delivery service to market, under its Prime Air brand.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s effort has already been years in the making (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/01/amazon-is-experimenting-with-autonomous-flying-delivery-drones/">it&#8217;s been running experiments since 2013</a>) &#8212; and last year the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/95cc17b6-88a5-47b0-a773-f247942a9a8f">FT</a>, citing a Prime Air source, reported that it still remains &#8220;years&#8221; out from realizing the goal of drone deliveries at scale. So while (another) U.K. trial of BVLOS drone tech is being lauded as a significant development for the industry by the regulator, any Brits expecting drone deliveries in the wild anytime soon are likely to be disappointed.</p>
<p>The CAA authorization for the sees.ai trial will enable the BVLOS test flights to operate under 150ft &#8212; initially requiring an observer to remain in visual line of sight with the aircraft and be able to communicate with the remote pilot if necessary, per the regulator.</p>
<p>So, technically then, the trials will begin as extended-line-of-sight (EVLOS), which still entail limits vs true BVLOS &#8212; enabling drone flights to operate further than 500m from the remote pilot (by deploying flight observers) but not removing on-site observers entirely, as is the ultimate industry goal. <strong>Update: </strong>The CAA confirmed the intention is to remove the observer once/if the trials prove the concept works. It also said the trial differs from traditional EVLOS flying because the spotter does not need to be in constant contact with the pilot &#8212; they only need the ability to contact the pilot if required.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP%201861%20-%20BVLOS%20Fundamentals%20v2.pdf">regulatory roadmap</a> published last fall the CAA wrote that many steps are required to arrive at the sought-for situation of BVLOS being &#8216;business as usual&#8217; in non-segregated airspace &#8212; so there still looks to be a long road ahead before commercial drones will be able to legally whiz around gathering data (or delivering stuff) far from any humans in the loop.</p>
<p>&#8220;The long-term aspiration of operators is for BVLOS operations to be a routine part of business across the UK. This vision requires a significant volume of evidence, experience and learning by everyone involved. There will inevitably be a need for innovators and the CAA to build, test, learn and repeat in small steps to work towards the vision,&#8221; the CAA roadmap notes.</p>
<p>Commenting on sees.ai&#8217;s trial authorization in a statement, CEO John McKenna dubbed it a &#8220;significant milestone&#8221;, adding: &#8220;We are accelerating towards a future where drones fly autonomously at scale &#8212; high up alongside manned aviation and low down inside our industrial sites, suburbs and cities. Securing this UK-first permission is a major step on this journey which will deliver big benefits to society across public health &amp; safety, efficiency and environmental impact.&#8221;</p>

The company says it will begin to roll out the ability for Venmo&#8217;s more than 70 million users to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies directly in the app, similar to the support Venmo parent company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">PayPal added late last year</a>. Initially, Venmo will support four types of cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash &#8212; the same that PayPal offers its U.S. users.</p>
<p>The company had already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/venmo-to-gain-crypto-budgeting-bill-pay-and-honey-integrations-this-year/">announced</a> its plans to introduce cryptocurrency on Venmo in 2021. Both Venmo and PayPal support for crypto come by way of a partnership with <a href="https://www.paxos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.paxos.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618924466703000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFORHplBX48OKy9S0KRYp6IimIx9A"><span class="m_-111796029276706869normaltextrun">Paxos Trust Company</span></a><span class="m_-111796029276706869normaltextrun">, a regulated provider of cryptocurrency products and services. </span></p>
<p>Though there isn&#8217;t much differentiation between what both PayPal and Venmo offers users today, the company explains that the move is more about getting cryptocurrencies in front of a separate, and arguably younger, audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2140640" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140640" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140640" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg 3680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140640" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;While there is some overlap between the bases, there are also a lot of customers who are discretely either PayPal or Venmo users,&#8221; explains Darrell Esch, Venmo general manager and SVP. &#8220;So this ultimately gives us a new group of customers who aren&#8217;t using PayPal day in and day out the ability to access [crypto] through Venmo.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that Venmo skews younger, with more of its users in their 20s and 30s, compared with the overall U.S. population. They also have other traits that might make them receptive to investing in cryptocurrencies. For example, they&#8217;re more likely than the overall U.S. population to have a college degree, they&#8217;re solidly middle-income earners and they skew toward digital natives.</p>

<p>The user base has also already begun purchasing crypto, Venmo notes. More than 30% had purchased crypto or equities, according to a 2020 Venmo customer study. This picked up during the pandemic, as well.</p>
<p>At launch, Venmo will leverage its in-app social feed to spread the word about cryptocurrencies. Users can share their crypto transactions to the feed, if they choose. This will raise awareness and engagement with the idea of crypto, as will Venmo&#8217;s new educational features. The company says it plans to publish access guides and videos inside the app that will help to answer some of the common questions about cryptocurrencies for those who are just getting started. (See below video, for example.)</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eFIQxwvXD0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Meanwhile, although PayPal announced its U.S. customers could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/paypals-new-feature-allows-u-s-consumers-to-check-out-using-cryptocurrency/">shop with cryptocurrencies</a> via its supported merchant base, Venmo doesn&#8217;t immediately have a similar option. However, the company as of February rolled out to its user base a feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/venmo-begins-piloting-business-profiles-for-small-sellers/">Business Profiles</a>, which enables Venmo users to transact with small sellers and merchants on its app. It&#8217;s not difficult to imagine the role that crypto could play here, as well, in the future. Venmo also offers other products, including a debit and credit card, which could also be leveraged in the future to take advantage of a crypto integration, perhaps.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, the only way to use crypto on Venmo is by buying, selling and holding. The company says users can start with as little as a dollar and pay via their linked bank account or debit card. Of note, the Venmo wallet doesn&#8217;t connect with that of parent company PayPal, though we understand the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees">exchange rates</a> will be the same.</p>
<p>Support for crypto on Venmo is starting to roll out today and will reach all customers within the next few weeks, Venmo says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is working on vehicles tailored to Chinese consumers as complaints about the quality of its electric vehicles send shock waves through the internet in the country.</p>
<p>The American EV giant is mulling new products that will be designed from the ground up for China, Grace Tao, a vice president at Tesla, <a href="https://m.21jingji.com/article/20210420/herald/f79c9e7c28095577ce7acb6859fc2c5a.html">told 21st Century Business Herald</a>, a Chinese business news outlet, during the Shanghai auto show this week. The vehicles developed in China will also be sold globally, she added.</p>
<p>At the same auto event on Monday, a woman showed up at Tesla&#8217;s booth, climbing atop a Tesla car and shouting allegations of faulty brakes made by the company. The person was later detained for damaging the vehicle, and Tesla <a href="https://weibo.com/3615027564/KbCRXnlzU?from=page_1006063615027564_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime">said</a> on microblogging platform Weibo that her car had crashed due to exceeding the speed limit, not quality issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nonetheless, the protestor won widespread sympathy when videos of her spread online. Many users joined in to vent about their Tesla problems. Posts with the hashtag &#8220;Tesla stand turned into a stage for defending rights&#8221; garnered <a href="https://s.weibo.com/weibo/%23%E7%89%B9%E6%96%AF%E6%8B%89%E5%B1%95%E5%8F%B0%E5%8F%98%E7%BB%B4%E6%9D%83%E7%8E%B0%E5%9C%BA%23">over 220 million views</a> on Weibo within two days.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have since the start been willing to work with national and authoritative third-party organizations to thoroughly inspect the issues raised by the public. By doing this, we wish to win assurance and understanding from consumers,&#8221; Tesla China said in a <a href="https://weibo.com/teslaofficial?profile_ftype=1&amp;is_all=1#_0">statement</a> posted on Weibo in response to the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we still haven&#8217;t fulfilled this wish, mainly because our ways of communicating with customers may be problematic. Secondly, we indeed can&#8217;t decide for our customers how they want to resolve these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like in the West, Tesla has fostered a cult-like following in China. And along with Apple, it&#8217;s one of the few American tech giants that have gained a firm foothold in China. Last year, Tesla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-summoned-by-chinese-regulators-for-quality-concerns/">shipped nearly 500,000 vehicles</a> globally and China contributed 20% to its revenues.</p>
<p>But the company also faces mounting competition from Chinese homegrown challengers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/tesla-rival-xpeng-lidar-dji/">Xpeng</a>, Nio, and Li Auto, the well-funded startups, as well as old-school carmakers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/huawei-auto-strategy/">with help from high-tech firms like Huawei</a>, are ready to take a slice of Tesla&#8217;s market. The designed-in-China vehicles are already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/business/china-xinjiang-boycott-heytea-nio.html">finding a spot</a> among the more patriotic crowds.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that the Chinese government is placing more scrutiny over Tesla. In January, the firm was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-summoned-by-chinese-regulators-for-quality-concerns/">summoned by local regulators</a> over quality concerns, shortly after it recalled several tens of thousands of vehicles in the country. The government restricted the use of Tesla by military facilities over national security concerns, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-restrict-tesla-usage-by-military-and-state-personnel-11616155643?mod=article_inline">reported</a> in March. Elon Musk later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-forum-musk-idUSKBN2BC04Q">said</a> his company would be shut down if its cars were used to spy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Challenger&#8221; startups in banking and insurance have upended their industries, and picked up significant business, by building more customer-friendly tools and services &#8212; more personalized, easier to access, and usually competitively priced &#8212; than those typically provided their bigger, incumbent rivals. Now, a startup out of Romania that is building tools to help the incumbents respond with better services of their own is announcing a significant round of funding as its business grows.</p>
<p><a href="https://fintechos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FintechOS</a>, which has built a low-code platform aimed at larger (older) banking and insurance companies to help them build new services and analytics on top of and around their existing infrastructure, has raised €51 million ($61.5 million at today&#8217;s rates, but $60 million at the time of the deal closing) in a Series B round of funding.</p>
<p>FintechOS&#8217;s opportunity has been to target wave of incumbents in the insurance and banking industries that have been slowly watching as newer players like Lemonade (in insurance) and a huge plethora of challenger banks (Revolut, N26, Monzo and many others) are swooping in and picking up customers, especially among younger demographics, while they have been unable to respond mostly because their infrastructure is too old and big. Turning a huge ship around, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-56505413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we have seen</a>, is no small task &#8212; a situation that has become only more apparent in the last year of pandemic living and the big shift to digital interactions that resulted from it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we launched FintechOS in 2017, we could already see existing solutions to digital transformation would struggle to deliver tangible results. By contrast, our unique approach has quickly inspired a sea-change in how financial institutions address digitization and engage with their customers,&#8221; said Teodor Blidarus, co-founder and CEO at FintechOS, in a statement. “Events over the last year have only increased pressure on our industry to evolve and as a result we’re seeing growing demand for our powerful platforms. Our latest round of funding will help us grow at the pace needed to improve outcomes for financial institutions and their customers globally.”</p>
<p>(It is not the only one. Others out of Europe in the space of bringing new tools to incumbent banks to help them make more modern and competitive products include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/10x-founded-by-the-ex-ceo-of-barclays-raises-46m-to-take-on-ancient-banking-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10x</a>, <a href="https://www.temenos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thought Machine</a>, <a href="https://www.temenos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temenos</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mambu</a> and many more.)</p>
<p>The Series B round of funding is being led by Draper-Esprit, with Earlybird, Gapminder Ventures, Launchub, and OTB Ventures (which all participated in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/fintechos-raises-14m-help-banks-launch-products-as-fast-as-fintech-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A in December 2019</a>) also participating. There are other backers in the round that are not being disclosed at this time, the startup added. FintechOS is also not disclosing its valuation. The company, based out of Bucharest, has raised just under $80 million to date.</p>
<p>FintechOS is active today in the UK and Europe &#8212; where it has been growing at a CAGR of 200% and says its services touch &#8220;millions&#8221; of people, with some of its key customers including the likes of banking giants Societe Generale and IdeaBank and international insurance brokers Howden. The plan will be to continue investing in those markets, as well as expanding internationally.</p>
<p>And it will be adding in more services. Today, the banking platform is designed to help banks launch more retail services for consumers and small and medium business customers, and for insurance companies to build new health, life and general insurance products (there are a lot of synergies in how insurance and financial services companies have been built over the years, and so it&#8217;s a natural couplet when it comes to building tools for those industries).</p>
<p>In the financial sector, FintechOS lets banks build in new digital onboarding flows, credit cards and loan products, savings and mortgage products. Insurance products include new approaches to generating and handling quotes, customer onboarding and management and claims automation &#8212; which may well bring FintechOS into closer contact and collaboration with the most successful startup to come out of its home country to date, the RPA juggernaut UiPath. In all cases, it helps stitch together data from a bank&#8217;s own systems with more modern tooling, and to link that up with yet more modern tools to help process that data more easily.</p>
<p>This is &#8220;low code&#8221; but it typically means that the company needs to work with third parties to enable all of this. Partners include the likes of integrators and other global services technicians, such as Microsoft, Deloitte, CapGemini, KPMG, and so on. (And the founders of the startup themselves come from consulting backgrounds so they well understand the role these companies play in the process of bringing technology into big businesses.)</p>
<p>FintechOS is tapping into a couple of very big trends that have arguably been the biggest in the financial and related insurance industries.</p>
<p>The first of these is the fact that core services around things like credit/loans, current deposits and savings are not just very complex to build but actually have largely become commoditized &#8212; similar to digital payments &#8212; and so packaging them up and turning them into services that can be integrated by way of an API makes them more easily accessed without the heavy lifting needed to build them from scratch. This lets companies focus instead on customer service or building more interesting tools around those basic services to customise them (for example AI based personalization). Disintermediating basic functions from the services built around them is arguably a bigger trend but it has been especially prevalent in enterprise, which has long been a slow-moving space when it comes to innovation in the back-end, and the front-end.</p>
<p>The second of these is the big swing towards using no-code and low-code tools to empower more people within organizations to get stuck in when they can see something not working as efficiently as it could, and building the workflows themselves to improve that. This also applies to trying out and testing new products &#8212; again something that typically has not been done in financial and insurance services but can now be possible with low-code and no-code tools.</p>
<p>“Not only is our technology helping financial institutions become customer centric, but it’s also helping them provide products and services to more people and businesses,&#8221; said Sergiu Negut, the other co-founder who is FintechOS&#8217;s CFO and COO, said in a separate statement. &#8220;With so many markets still underserved, the ability to tailor offerings to a segment of one offers the opportunity to increase financial inclusion and adheres to our ideal that easy access to financial services is essential. We’re delighted to be working with investors who share our views on how fintech should be transforming the financial services industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, Draper Esprit also has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed Thought Machine</a>, another big player in the world of fintech that is taking some of the learnings and models that have helped new entrants disrupt incumbents, and is packaging them up as services for incumbents, too. It takes a different approach to doing this, not using low-code but smart contracts, which could be one reason why the VC doesn&#8217;t see the investments as conflict of interest. They are also tackling an enormous market, and so at least for now there is room for them, and many others in the space, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/10x-founded-by-the-ex-ceo-of-barclays-raises-46m-to-take-on-ancient-banking-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10x</a>, Temenos, Mambu, Rapyd and many others.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we met Teo and Sergiu, we were immediately convinced of their vision: a data led, end-to-end platform, facilitated with a low-code/no-code infrastructure,&#8221; Vinoth Jayakumar, partner at Draper Esprit, said in a statement. “Incumbent financial services firms have cost-to-income ratios up to 90%, so we see a huge and increasing need for infrastructure software that allows digitisation at speed, ease and lower cost. Draper Esprit builds enduring partnerships; with the team at FintechOS we hope to build an enduring fintech company that will dramatically change financial services experiences for people all over the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year we covered the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/heights-raises-2m-for-its-subscription-supplements-aimed-new-braincare-category/">Heights</a>, a new supplements startup in an increasingly hot category. <a href="https://wearefeel.com">Feel</a>, is a year-old UK startup with another twist on this world: pure nutritional supplements. It’s now closed a $6.2 million investment, led by Fuel Ventures, with participation from TMT Investments, Sova VC, Richard Longhurst (founder of LoveHoney.com) and Igor Ryabenkiy (founder and GP of Altair Capital).</p>
<p>Feel founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/borhod/?originalSubdomain=uk">Boris Hodakel</a> says he spun his startup up after looking at the UK’s big health and retail brands including Graze, Tesco, Bulk Powders and Simba Sleep.</p>
<p>In many ways Feel is very akin to Graze. The supplements arrive in a post-box-friendly box and is available in a range of subscription packages. This is basically ‘Graze nuts, but for supplements.’</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Feel has a direct-to-consumer subscription model, and is claiming a 60x growth in its first year and 21,000 active subscriptions.</p>
<p>Hodakel’s contention is that while Feel provides higher grade supplements to consumers which cost more to produce, it manages to keep costs down for consumers via direct-to-consumer model.</p>
<p>Hodakel, founder and CEO of Feel said: “Not all vitamins are created equal and the majority you find on retail shelves have a dirty formula that is difficult to absorb by the body, missing natural elements. We’re the cleanest alternative in the market &#8211; backed up by science &#8211;  and continually invest in making our formulas as effective as possible while still affordable.”</p>
<p>He says he started Feel because, having a skin problem, supplements were part of his health routine, but &#8220;the aha moment&#8221; happened he realized how many fillers were in normal supplements. &#8220;All our formulas are researched and formulated in-house, and we keep updating them, like our flagship multivitamin in just two years is already in its 3rd version,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mark Pearson, managing partner at Fuel Ventures added: “The growth and the expansion of Feel’s product line present a really exciting time for Feel and we are supporting them in becoming a significant disruptor to the health supplement market.” </p>
<p>Alexander Chikunov, Partner at Sova VC added, “Feel is in the process of disrupting consumer habits around vitamin intake, and changing a marketplace worth $144bn by providing its customers with top-quality products, combined with flawless and friendly service.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the past ten years, an investment team led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/winterchristian/">Christian Winter</a>, Jan Sessenhausen, Helmut Klawitter and Wilken Engelbracht worked principally with German family offices, investing in startups such as Klarna, Zalando and Delivery Hero that went on to be worth around €80 billion in total. Today they are launching a VC firm of their own, Cusp Capital, with €300 million ($361m) under their belt. </p>
<p>Cusp Capital will back early-stage young tech companies across Europe. Its LPs include institutional investors such as the European Investment Fund, KfW Capital, RAG Stiftung, and NRW.BANK, alongside family offices and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>In a statement Christian Winter, general partner, said: “Cusp Capital is built on and incorporates our experience as investors over the past decade. We have worked in various operational roles and accompanied more than 50 early-stage companies to successful exits and IPOs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to forming Cusp, the team of partners had worked largely with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erivan_Haub">Haub</a> Family office  and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengelmann_Group">Tengelmann Group</a>.</p>
<p>Over a call, he told me the firm is planning lead deals in Seed and Series A rounds, and co-lead in growth rounds. They plan to do 25-30 investments with this fund or a 6-7 a year period.</p>
<p>Cusp’s Initial investments will range from mid-to-high single-digit million Euros and it says it has already signed the first term sheets for investments.</p>
<p>Jan Sessenhausen, General Partner of Cusp Capital says: “We dedicate a lot of time to developing investment hypotheses with global relevance. We use these hypotheses to identify promising companies, and actively approach entrepreneurs with our expertise. Having our own perspective early on allows us to see eye-to-eye with founders and have the deep discussions needed to help them realize their full potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of those hypotheses is around focused sustainability. The firm says this will be a core theme for its investing, going forward. In addition, widening access to financing for lower-income consumers will also be a feature of its investing thesis.</p>
<p>Cusp Capital is headquartered in Essen, with a second office in Berlin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One after another, Chinese tech giants have announced their plans for the auto space over the last few months. Some internet companies, like search engine provider Baidu, decided to recruit help from a traditional carmaker to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/baidu-electric-car-making/">produce cars</a>. Xiaomi, which makes its own smartphones but has stressed for years it&#8217;s a light-asset firm making money from software services, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/xiaomi-ev-subsidiary/">jumped on the automaking bandwagon</a>. Industry observers are now speculating who will be the next. Huawei naturally comes to their minds.</p>
<p>Huawei seems well-suited for building cars &#8212; at least more qualified than some of the pure internet firms &#8212; thanks to its history in manufacturing and supply chain management, brand recognition, and vast retail network. But the telecom equipment and smartphone maker repeatedly denied reports claiming it was launching a car brand. Instead, it says its role is to be a Tier 1 supplier for automakers or OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).</p>
<p>Huawei is not a carmaker, the company&#8217;s rotating chairman Eric Xu reiterated recently at the firm&#8217;s annual analyst conference in Shenzhen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Since 2012, I have personally engaged with the chairmen and CEOs of all major car OEMs in China as well as executives of German and Japanese automakers. During this process, I found that the automotive industry needs Huawei. It doesn&#8217;t need the Huawei brand, but instead, it needs our ICT [information and communication technology] expertise to help build future-oriented vehicles,&#8221; said Xu, who said the strategy has not changed since it was incepted in 2018.</p>
<p>There are three major roles in auto production: branded vehicle manufacturers like Audi, Honda, Tesla, and soon Apple; Tier 1 companies that supply car parts and systems directly to carmakers, including established ones like Bosch and Continental, and now Huawei; and lastly, chip suppliers including Nvidia, Intel and NXP, whose role is increasingly crucial as industry players make strides toward highly automated vehicles. Huawei also makes in-house car chips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huawei wants to be the next-generation Bosch,&#8221; an executive from a Chinese robotaxi startup told TechCrunch, asking not to be named.</p>
<p>Huawei makes its position as a Tier 1 supplier unequivocal. So far it has secured three major customers: BAIC, Chang&#8217;an Automobile, and Guangzhou Automobile Group.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t have too many of these types of in-depth collaboration,&#8221; Xu assured.</p>
<h2>L4 autonomy?</h2>

<p>Arcfox, a new electric passenger car brand under state-owned carmaker BAIC, debuted its Alpha S model quipped with Huawei&#8217;s &#8220;HI&#8221; systems, short for Huawei Inside (not unlike &#8220;Powered by Intel&#8221;), during China&#8217;s annual auto show on Saturday. The electric sedan, priced between 388,900 yuan and 429,900 yuan (about $60,000 and $66,000), comes with Huawei functions including an operating system driven by Huawei&#8217;s Kirin chip, a range of apps that run on HarmonyOS, automated driving, fast charging, and cloud computing.</p>
<p>Perhaps most eye-catching is that Alpha S has achieved Level 4 capabilities, which Huawei confirmed with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a bold statement, for it means that the car will not require human intervention in most scenarios, that is, drivers can take their hands off the wheels and nap.</p>
<p>There are some nuances to this claim, though. In a recent <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2021-04-17/doc-ikmyaawc0275912.shtml">interview</a>, Su Qing, general manager for autonomous driving at Huawei, said Alpha S is L4 in terms of &#8220;experience&#8221; but L2 according to &#8220;legal&#8221; responsibilities. China has only permitted a small number of companies to test autonomous vehicles without safety drivers in restricted areas and is far from letting consumer-grade driverless cars roam urban roads.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Huawei&#8217;s<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;L4&#8221; functions were shown during a demo, during which the Arcfox car traveled for 1,000 kilometers in a busy Chinese city without human intervention, though a safety driver was present in the driving seat. Automating the car is a stack of sensors, including three lidars, six millimeter-wave radars, 13 ultrasonic radars and 12 cameras, as well as Huawei&#8217;s own chipset for automated driving.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This would be much better than Tesla,&#8221; Xu said of the car&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>But some argue the Huawei-powered vehicle isn&#8217;t L4 by strict definition. The debate seems to be a matter of semantics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our cars you see today are already L4, but I can assure you, I dare not let the driver leave the car,&#8221; Su said. &#8220;Before you achieve really big MPI [miles per intervention] numbers, don&#8217;t even mention L4. It&#8217;s all just demos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not L4 if you can&#8217;t remove the safety driver,&#8221; the executive from the robotaxi company argued. &#8220;A demo can be done easily, but removing the driver is very difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This technology that Huawei claims is different from L4 autonomous driving,&#8221; said a director working for another Chinese autonomous vehicle startup. &#8220;The current challenge for L4 is not whether it <em>can</em> be driverless but how to be driverless <em>at all times.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>L4 or not, Huawei is certainly willing to splurge on the future of driving. This year, the firm is on track to spend over $1 billion on smart vehicle components and tech, Xu said at the analyst event.</p>
<h2>A 5G future</h2>
<p>Many believe 5G will play a key role in accelerating the development of driverless vehicles. Huawei, the world&#8217;s biggest telecom equipment maker, would have a lot to reap from 5G rollouts across the globe, but Xu argued the next-gen wireless technology isn&#8217;t a necessity for self-driving vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make autonomous driving a reality, the vehicles themselves have to be autonomous. That means a vehicle can drive autonomously without external support,&#8221; said the executive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Completely relying on 5G or 5.5G for autonomous driving will inevitably cause problems. What if a 5G site goes wrong? That would raise a very high bar for mobile network operators. They would have to ensure their networks cover every corner, don&#8217;t go wrong in any circumstances and have high levels of resilience. I think that&#8217;s simply an unrealistic expectation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huawei may be happy enough as a Tier 1 supplier if it ends up taking over Bosch&#8217;s market. Many Chinese companies are shifting away from Western tech suppliers towards homegrown options in anticipation of future sanctions or simply to seek cheaper alternatives that are just as robust. Arcfox is just the beginning of Huawei&#8217;s car ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ridedott.com">Dott</a> has raised a new $85 million Series B funding round — this round is a mix of equity and asset-backed debt financing. Belgium-based investment company <a href="https://www.sofinagroup.com">Sofina</a> is leading the investment. Dott is a micromobility startup that is better known for its colorful electric scooters that you can find across several European cities.</p>
<p>The company operates a fleet of 30,000 electric scooters in five countries. Users can download a mobile app and unlock a scooter through the app. The company charges an unlocking fee as well as a per-minute price.</p>
<p>During its early days, Dott positioned itself as a capital-efficient, sustainable e-scooter company. It has raised a lot less money than Bird or Lime and it has taken a different approach when it comes to operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, Dott has always had its own warehouses to charge and repair vehicles. The startup doesn’t work with third-party logistics providers. Dott has hired its own in-house team of logistics employees.</p>
<p>Similarly, Dott tries to repair, reuse and recycle scooters as much as possible. Thanks to swappable batteries and electric trucks, the company tries to keep its CO2 emissions as low as possible in the cities where it operates.</p>
<p>As a result, the company has won permits to operate in Paris and Lyon following tender processes. Overall, the company operates in a dozen cities in France, Italy, Belgium, Germany and Poland. Tier, a European competitor, has been expanding more aggressively and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/e-scooter-startup-tier-raises-250-million-round-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/">has raised $250 million</a> in November 2020.</p>
<p>In addition to Sofina, new and existing investors include EQT Ventures, Prosus Ventures, Aberdeen Standard Investments, Estari, Expon Capital, Felix Capital, FJ Labs, Invest-NL, McRock Capital and Quadia.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand beyond e-scooters with a new bike-sharing service. Dott already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/dott-to-expand-beyond-e-scooters-with-bike-sharing-service/">shared images</a> of its e-bike. It should be launching this summer.</p>
<p>Dott also plans to expand to other cities and countries, starting with Spain and the U.K. As you can see, Dott doesn’t want to launch a hundred cities at once. It is slowly rolling out its service in new cities. It is currently EBIT positive across all cities and Dott probably wants to keep it this way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-based fintech <a href="https://stacs.io/">Hashstacs Pte Ltd (STACS)</a> announced today it has raised $3.6 million USD in pre-Series A funding. The company develops blockchain platforms that can work with financial institutions’ existing infrastructure, and its core technology is also used in GreenSTACS for environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments. The round was led by Wavemaker Partners, which focuses on enterprise and deep tech companies in Southeast Asia, with participation from the Tribe Accelerator, a program for blockchain startups backed by the Singaporean government. STACS participated in Tribe last year, along with Project Ubin, the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s blockchain-based multi-currency payments network initiative.</p>

<p>Founded in 2019, STACS has now raised a total of more than $6 million and is preparing to raise Series A funding later this year. The company’s goal is to fix fragmentation in the tech systems used by financial institutions that can result in capital being locked in international clearing systems, a build-up of transaction fees and fines for trades that fail to settle. Its core solution is a <a href="https://stacs.io/stacs-technology/">technology stack</a> that is built around STACS blockchain. It allows clients to integrate payment platforms (including Ubin), trading platforms and external software like user management systems, while enabling smart contracts and digital ledgers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>STACS’ products include a real-time trade processing platform that is used by clients like Eastspring Investments and BNP Paribas Securities Service. Some of its other clients are Deutsche Bank, Bursa Malaysia, EFG Bank and Bluecell Intelligence. STACS co-founder and managing director Benjamin Soh told TechCrunch that STACS is targeting a network of more than 30 institutions by the end of this year.</p>
<p>GreenSTACS <a href="https://en.prnasia.com/releases/apac/-c-o-r-r-e-c-t-i-o-n-bluecell-intelligence--313550.shtml">launched last month</a> in a collaboration with Bluecell Intelligence to help companies certify and monitor green and sustainability-related loans and bonds.</p>
<p>Soh said in an email that STACS received many requests from financial institutions that needed to perform impact monitoring on ESG projects, but were not able to do so effectively because “information sources are asymmetric, there is no common data infrastructure and serving of ESG financing is typically too inefficient.”</p>
<p>STACS’ goal is to make GreenSTACS “the common infrastructure” for ESG financing and impact monitoring, he added. The platform enables loan and bond parameters to be programmed into security tokens and connects with data sources, like IoT devices or satellite images, to create real-time impact reports on a distributed ledger. This helps prevent “greenwashing,” a term that refers to making something seem more environmentally-friendly or sustainable than it really is.</p>
<p>“Essentially, this would boost investors’ and banks’ confidence with green financing by ensuring green money is strictly used in achieving pledged green goals and policies,” said Soh.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Wavemaker general partner Gavin Lee said, “There is an immense opportunity to help financial institutions process large volumes of trade more quickly, securely and accurately while reducing costs and illiquid capital. As an enterprise distributed ledger technology provider, STACS has productized a secure layer that can be deployed instantly above existing infrastructure. Enterprise sales is never easy for young companies, but Benjamin is a convincing and seasoned serial entrepreneur who has secured numerous leading financial institutions as key clients.”</p>

<p>Indonesian startup <a href="https://colearn.id/">CoLearn</a> started as a chain of physical tutoring centers and was in the process of shifting to a hybrid offline-online model when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The team sensed that remote learning would permanently change how students want to be tutored and decided to focus completely on its app, which launched in August 2020. CoLearn has since been downloaded more than 3.5 million times and has about one million active users, mostly students in grades 7 to 12.</p>
<p>The company announced today it has raised $10 million in Series A funding co-led by Alpha Wave Incubation and edtech-focused GSV Ventures. This marks the first time both have made an investment in Indonesia. The round also included participation from returning investors Sequoia Capital India’s Surge and AC Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of the Jakarta-based company’s goals is to improve educational standards in Indonesia. The country’s PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment, a global ranking system created by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) rankings <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/12/04/not-">are in the bottom 10% for math, science and reading</a>. CoLearn’s goal is to help move up Indonesia’s PISA ratings to the top 50% over the next five years.</p>
<p>CoLearn’s app offers more than 250,000 pre-recorded videos with homework help. The videos serve as a hook to convince students (or their parents) to sign up for CoLearn’s live online classes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140770" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140770" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2140770" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png" alt="Screenshots from CoLearn, an Indonesian online learning app" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/App-Screenshot.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140770" class="wp-caption-text">CoLearn screenshots</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s co-founders are Abhay Saboo, Marc Irawan and BYJU product team alum Sandeep Devaram. Despite being the world’s fourth most populous country with 270 million people, Indonesia has not seen the same level of investment and innovation in its educational infrastructure as countries like China or India, Saboo told TechCrunch. “We’re trying to solve the problem of how do you change mindsets, how do you change motivation, how do you increase in confidence levels?”</p>
<p>CoLearn started its offline in business in 2018, before shifting to a hybrid model. Once the pandemic hit, the company decided to go fully online. Even after schools reopen, the team anticipates that most students will prefer the convenience of online afterschool learning because going to brick-and-mortar tutoring centers can eat up hours of their time each day, Saboo said.</p>
<p>CoLearn&#8217;s users ask about 5 million questions through the app each month. Its AI platform matches them with video tutorials, recorded by more than 400 tutors, that break down key concepts. Saboo said creating engaging videos instead of presenting solutions in a diagram is one of the ways CoLearn differentiates from competitors like SnapAsk, which raised $35 million last year to expand in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>“What we realized is that kids are really craving a step-by-step explanation and this is the TikTok generation, so if a picture says a thousand words, then a video says a million,” he said. He added that students often hit pause on the video when they think they have the answer to a question, before skipping to the end to see if they got it right, indicating that they want to understand concepts instead of simply getting a solution.</p>
<p>CoLearn’s live online classes will be its main priority going forward and the startup hopes to replicate the success of companies like China’s Yuanfadao and Zuoyebang. As part of that goal, it runs teacher training programs and expects to train more than 200 teachers over the next two years, especially in STEM subjects. The company may eventually scale into other countries that have similar issues with their education systems, but Saboo said CoLearn’s plan is to focus on Indonesia for at last the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Other investors in CoLearn include Leo Capital, TNB Aura, S7V, January Capital, Alpha JWC, Taurus Ventures, Alter Global and Mahanusa Capital.</p>
<p>In press statement, GSV Ventures managing partner Deborah Quazzo said, “The opportunity to build efficacious learning solutions for the fourth largest country in the world is vast. The greatest businesses are created when entrepreneurs tackle large, important problems and CoLearn is doing that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://payhawk.com">Payhawk</a> has raised a $20 million funding round. QED Investors is leading the round with existing investor Earlybird Digital East also participating. Payhawk is building a unified system to manage all the money that is going in and out.</p>
<p>Essentially, companies switching to Payhawk can replace several services they already use and that didn’t interact well with each other. Payhawk lets you issue corporate cards for your employees, manage invoices and track payments from a single interface.</p>
<p>After signing up, customers get their own banking details with a dedicated IBAN. You can connect with your existing bank account, load funds to your Payhawk account and start using it in multiple ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Compared to other companies working on similar products, Payhawk gives each customer their own IBAN, which means they can receive third-party payments.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Payhawk is that customers can issue virtual and physical cards for employees with different rules. You can set up a team budget, configure an approval workflow for large transactions and let Payhawk handle receipt collection from those card transactions.</p>
<p>You can upload invoices to manage them through Payhawk. The startup tries to automatically extract data from those invoices for easier reconciliation. Payhawk also lets you reimburse employees. The service acts as a single source of truth for your company’s spending. Finally, you can connect Payhawk with your existing ERP system.</p>
<p>As a software-as-a-service solution, you pay a monthly subscription fee that will vary depending on optional features and the number of active cards. Clients include LuxAir, Lotto24, Viking Life, ATU, Gtmhub, MacPaw and By Miles. Overall, the startup has 200 clients.</p>
<p>The company has been growing nicely as revenue doubled in Q1 2021. It currently accepts clients in the European Union and the U.K. but it already plans to expand beyond those markets. Up next, Payhawk plans to launch credit cards, more currencies and tighter integration with corporate bank accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Surprise! It’s another Apple Event. Gone are the days of getting a few weeks&#8217; notice before these events now that they’re entirely virtual (at least until 2022, most likely). Instead, the company just dropped the news last week.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there have been plenty of rumors leading up to tomorrow’s big event &#8212; and perhaps even a few hints in the invite itself. After skipping last year’s spring event, due to cresting COVID-19 numbers in the U.S., the company has grown much more comfortable dropping semi-regular livestreamed events. As ever, we’ll be covering the event as it unfolds, starting at 10AM PT/1PM ET. But here’s what we expect to see, along with the customary high-production-value sweeping-drone transitions.</p>
<p>The closest thing we have to a surefire bet is the arrival of new iPads, keeping in line with what looks to be a finger-drawn image on the invite. Specifically, the iPad Pro is leading the way. The high-end tablet has been rumored to be getting a refresh at some point this season, so no time like the present.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1961508" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="946" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=150,139 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=300,277 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=768,709 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=680,628 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=1536,1418 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-ipad-pro-keyboard_03182020.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The biggest news is likely to be the addition of a<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display"> mini-LED display</a> for the 12.9-inch model (a refresh to the 11-inch is coming sometime down the road). Benefits include increased brightness, better battery life and less potential for image burn-in. The tech would arrive in the place of the OLED currently found on iPhone models.</p>
<p>The improved screen technology is said to add <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/19/new-ipad-pro-thicker-mini-led-display/">a bit of thickness</a> to the design, which otherwise is largely unchanged. Supply constraints could ultimately put a damper on availability, so there’s a possibility that the product could be announced tomorrow, but delayed for a later date.</p>
<p>There’s likely to be a processor update, as well. Rumor has it that the A14X will utilize the same technology that forms the foundation of the M1 chip found on recent Macs. That could, in turn, bring a real big performance bump.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1798254" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="894" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=300,262 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=768,671 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=680,594 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=1536,1341 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=2048,1789 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-iPad-Mini-and-supports-Apple-Pencil-03192019.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum is the iPad mini. The 8.4-inch tablet would be getting its first major boost in two years. The updates are said to be less pronounced than on the Pro. The classic iPad design language will remain, though the device is said to be getting a performance boost courtesy of new chips. A new Apple Pencil is rumored to be on the way, as well, though details are scarce.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1969511" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="615" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airtags-settings-iphone-1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>And could this be the event where Apple finally gives the world <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">AirTags</a>? All signs point to “definitely maybe.” After several delays, the company’s Tile competitor is said to finally be arriving. At the very least, the timing makes sense. After all, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">just opened up third-party “Find My” access</a>, along with a bunch of compatible devices. That includes direct competitor, the Chipolo ONE Spot.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1775574" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mrd-apple-tv.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Also on the maybe pile is a new Apple TV featuring a Find My compatible remote. That seems like a slam dunk, as one of the most frequently lost products in history. With Apple on a two-year line-wide refresh, some new silicon Macs could be on the list. The most likely candidate? At the moment it seems to be a long-awaited refresh to the iMac line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.druva.com/">Druva</a>, a software company that sells cloud data backup services, announced today that it has closed a $147 million round of capital. Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), a group that <a href="https://www.cdpq.com/en/about-us/history">manages Quebec&#8217;s pension fund</a>, led the round, which also saw participation from Neuberger Berman. Prior investors including Atreides Management and Viking Global Investors put capital into the deal, as well.</p>
<p>Druva last raised a $130 million round led by Viking in mid-2019 at around a $1 billion valuation. At the time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/saas-data-protection-provider-druva-nabs-130m-now-at-a-1b-valuation-acquires-cloudlanes/">TechCrunch commented</a> that the company&#8217;s software-as-a-service (SaaS) backup service was tackling a large market. (TechCrunch also covered the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/eyeing-an-ipo-druva-raises-51m-for-its-data-backup-recovery-and-discovery-services/">$51 million round back in 2016</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/cloud-data-management-startup-druva-raises-80m/">$80 million raise from 2017</a>.)</p>
<p>Since then SaaS has continued to grow at a rapid clip, including a strong 2020 spurred on by COVID-19 boosting digital transformation efforts at companies of all sizes. In that context, it&#8217;s not surprising to see Druva put together a new capital round.</p>
<p>A recent tie-up between Dell and Druva, first <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2021/01/22/dell-emc-druva-backup-as-a-service-offering/">reported in January of this year</a>, was <a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2021/04/06/dell-emc-powerprotect-backup-service/">formally announced earlier this month</a>. The selection of Druva by Dell could help provide the unicorn with a customer base to sell into for some time. TechCrunch wrote about Druva <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/why-im-hitting-pause-on-arr-focused-coverage/">earlier this year</a>, during the reporting process the company said that it had &#8220;almost tripled its annual revenue in three years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its new round did include some secondary shares, which Neuberger Berman managing director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raman-gambhir-38414540/">Raman Gambhir</a> described as difficult to snag during a call with TechCrunch. He explained that some of the secondary sales were due to some prior funds reaching their end-of-life cycle. Druva CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspreets/">Jaspreet Singh</a> stressed that his backers are working to do what&#8217;s best for the company instead of merely maximizing their returns during a joint interview.</p>

<p>Singh told TechCrunch that business at Druva is accelerating. Normally we&#8217;d note that that sounds like IPO fodder, especially as Druva passed the $100 million ARR threshold back in 2019. However, as the company has been making IPO noise for some time, it&#8217;s hard to predict when it might pull the trigger. Our coverage of the company&#8217;s 2016 round noted that the company could go public within a year. And our coverage of its 2019 investment included Singh telling TechCrunch that an IPO was 12 to 18 months away.</p>
<p>It probably is, now, but that&#8217;s beside the point. With refreshed accounts, a market moving in its direction, and some early investor relieved in its latest investment the company has quarters worth of time to play with. Still, Singh did stress that its new financing round did select investors that he said is building a long-term position; that&#8217;s the sort of verbiage that CEOs break out when they are building a pre-IPO cap table.</p>
<p>Gambhir told TechCrunch that his firm has already requested shares in Druva&#8217;s eventual IPO. Perhaps we&#8217;ll see Fidelity show up with a $50 million check in a few months.</p>
<p>Every startup that raises capital tells the media that they are going to use the funds to expand their staff, double down on their tech and, often, invest in their go-to-market (GTM) motion. Druva is no exception, but its CEO did tell TechCrunch that his company currently has over 200 open GTM positions. That&#8217;s quite a few. Presumably that spend will help the company keep its growth rate strong in percentage terms as it does, finally, look to list.</p>
<p>This is yet another growth round for a late-stage, enterprise-facing software company. But it&#8217;s also a round into a company that had to move its operations to the United States when it was founded, at the behest of its investors per Singh. And Druva has done some pretty neat cloud work, it told TechCrunch earlier this year, to ensure that it can defend software-like margins despite material storage loads.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an S-1 that we&#8217;re looking forward to. Start the countdown.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Data isn&#8217;t abstract — it has a direct impact on people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>In 2019, an AI-powered delivery robot<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f5bd21da-33b8-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2"> momentarily blocked</a> a wheelchair user from safely accessing the curb when crossing a busy road. Speaking about the incident, the person noted, &#8220;It&#8217;s important that the development of technologies [doesn&#8217;t put] disabled people on the line as collateral.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside other minority groups, people with disabilities have long been harmed by flawed data and data tools. Disabilities are diverse, nuanced and dynamic; they don&#8217;t fit within the formulaic structure of AI, which is programmed to find patterns and form groups. Because AI treats any outlier data as &#8220;noise&#8221; and disregards it, too often people with disabilities are excluded from its conclusions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			Disabilities are diverse, nuanced and dynamic; they don&#8217;t fit within the formulaic structure of AI, which is programmed to find patterns and form groups.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Take for example the<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/07/777438412/feds-say-self-driving-uber-suv-did-not-recognize-jaywalking-pedestrian-in-fatal-"> case of Elaine Herzberg</a>, who was struck and killed by a self-driving Uber SUV in 2018. At the time of the collision, Herzberg was pushing a bicycle, which meant Uber&#8217;s system struggled to categorize her and flitted between labeling her as a &#8220;vehicle,&#8221; &#8220;bicycle,&#8221; and &#8220;other.&#8221; The tragedy raised many questions for people with disabilities; would a person in a wheelchair or a scooter be at risk of the same fatal misclassification?</p>
<p>We need a new way of collecting and processing data. &#8220;Data&#8221; ranges from personal information, user feedback, resumes, multimedia, user metrics and much more, and it&#8217;s constantly being used to optimize our software. However, it&#8217;s not done so with the understanding of the spectrum of nefarious ways that it can and <em>is </em>used in the wrong hands, or when principles are not applied to each touchpoint of building.</p>

<p>Our products are long overdue for a new, fairer data framework to ensure that data is managed with people with disabilities in mind. If it isn’t, people with disabilities will face more friction, and dangers, in a day-to-day life that is increasingly dependent on digital tools.</p>
<h2>Misinformed data hampers the building of good tools</h2>
<p>Products that lack accessibility might not stop people with disabilities from leaving their homes, but they can stop them from accessing pivot points of life like quality healthcare, education and on-demand deliveries.</p>
<p>Our tools are a product of their environment. They reflect their creators’ worldview and subjective lens. For too long, the same groups of people have been overseeing faulty data systems. It&#8217;s a closed loop, where underlying biases are perpetuated and groups that were already invisible remain unseen. But as data progresses, that loop becomes a snowball. We’re dealing with machine-<em>learning</em> models — if they&#8217;re taught long enough that &#8220;not being X&#8221; (read: white, able-bodied, cisgendered) means not being &#8220;normal,&#8221; they will evolve by building on that foundation.</p>
<p>Data is interlinked in ways that are invisible to us. It’s not enough to say that your algorithm won’t exclude people with registered disabilities. Biases are present in other sets of data. For example, in the United States it’s illegal to refuse someone a mortgage loan because they’re Black. But by basing the process heavily on credit scores — which have<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/10/16/how-race-affects-your-credit-score/"> inherent biases</a> detrimental to people of color — banks indirectly<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-modern-day-redlining-20180215-story.html"> exclude</a> that segment of society.</p>
<p>For people with disabilities, indirectly biased data could potentially be frequency of physical activity or number of hours commuted per week. Here’s a concrete example of how indirect bias translates to software: If a hiring algorithm studies candidates&#8217; facial movements during a video interview, a person with a cognitive disability or mobility impairment will experience<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/02/algorithmic-bias-people-with-disabilities.html"> different barriers</a> than a fully able-bodied applicant.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4DeTl4xHSp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/4-signs-your-product-is-not-as-accessible-as-you-think/">4 signs your product is not as accessible as you think</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 signs your product is not as accessible as you think&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/4-signs-your-product-is-not-as-accessible-as-you-think/embed/#?secret=4DeTl4xHSp" data-secret="4DeTl4xHSp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The problem also stems from people with disabilities not being viewed as part of businesses&#8217; target market. When companies are in the early stage of brainstorming their ideal users, people’s disabilities often don&#8217;t figure, especially when they&#8217;re less noticeable — like mental health illness. That means the initial user data used to iterate products or services doesn&#8217;t come from these individuals. In fact, <a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/2020-state-of-digital-accessibility-report/">56%</a> of organizations still don’t routinely test their digital products among people with disabilities.</p>
<p>If tech companies proactively included individuals with disabilities on their teams, it’s far more likely that their target market would be more representative. In addition, all tech workers need to be aware of and factor in the visible and invisible exclusions in their data. It’s no simple task, and we need to collaborate on this. Ideally, we’ll have more frequent conversations, forums and knowledge-sharing on how to eliminate indirect bias from the data we use daily.</p>
<h2>We need an ethical stress test for data</h2>
<p>We test our products all the time — on usability, engagement and even logo preferences. We know which colors perform better to convert paying customers, and the words that resonate most with people, so why aren’t we setting a bar for data ethics?</p>
<p>Ultimately, the responsibility of creating ethical tech does not just lie at the top. Those laying the brickwork for a product day after day are also liable. It was the Volkswagen engineer (not the company CEO) who was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41053740">sent to jail</a> for developing a device that enabled cars to evade U.S. pollution rules.</p>
<p>Engineers, designers, product managers; we all have to acknowledge the data in front of us and think about <em>why</em> we collect it and <em>how </em>we collect it. That means dissecting the data we&#8217;re requesting and analyzing what our motivations are. Does it always make sense to ask about someone&#8217;s disabilities, sex or race? How does having this information benefit the end user?</p>
<p>At Stark, we&#8217;ve developed a five-point framework to run when designing and building any kind of software, service or tech. We have to address:</p>
<ol>
<li>What data we&#8217;re collecting.</li>
<li>Why we&#8217;re collecting it.</li>
<li>How it will be used (and how it can be misused).</li>
<li>Simulate IFTTT: &#8220;If this, then that.&#8221; Explain possible scenarios in which the data can be used nefariously, and alternate solutions. For instance, how users can be impacted by an at-scale data breach? What happens if this private information becomes public to their family and friends?</li>
<li>Ship or trash the idea.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we can only explain our data using vague terminology and unclear expectations, or by stretching the truth, we shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to have that data. The framework forces us to break down data in the most simple manner. If we can&#8217;t, it&#8217;s because we’re not yet equipped to handle it responsibly.</p>

<h2>Innovation has to include people with disabilities</h2>
<p>Complex data technology is <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/14/1016122/these-five-ai-developments-will-shape-2021-and-beyond/">entering new sectors</a> all the time, from vaccine development to robotaxis. Any bias against individuals with disabilities in these sectors stops them from accessing the most cutting-edge products and services. As we become more dependent on tech in every niche of our lives, there&#8217;s greater room for exclusion in how we carry out everyday activities.</p>
<p>This is all about forward thinking and baking inclusion into your product at the start. Money and/or experience aren’t limiting factors here — changing your thought process and development journey is free; it’s just a conscious pivot in a better direction. While the upfront cost may be a heavy lift, the profits you’d lose from not tapping into these markets, or because you end up retrofitting your product down the line, far outweigh that initial expense. This is especially true for enterprise-level companies that won’t be able to access academia or governmental contracts without being compliant.</p>
<p>So early-stage companies, integrate accessibility principles into your product development and gather user data to constantly reinforce those principles. Sharing data across your onboarding, sales and design teams will give you a more complete picture of where your users are experiencing difficulties. Later-stage companies should carry out a self-assessment to determine where those principles are lacking in their product, and harness historical data and new user feedback to generate a fix.</p>
<p>An overhaul of AI and data isn’t just about adapting businesses’ framework. We still need the people at the helm to be more diverse. The fields remain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/16/artificial-intelligence-lack-diversity-new-york-university-study">overwhelmingly male and white</a>, and in tech, there are numerous <a href="https://medium.com/tech-disability-project/the-gift-of-grey-spaces-in-our-careers-bc01b925eb34">firsthand accounts</a> of exclusion and <a href="https://medium.com/tech-disability-project/my-own-worst-enemy-is-the-heckler-in-my-mind-ea5f622e3164">bias</a> toward people with disabilities. Until the teams curating data tools are themselves more diverse, nations&#8217; growth will continue to be stifled, and people with disabilities will be some of the hardest-hit casualties.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Robotic process automation unicorn UiPath is set to go public this week, concentrating our focus on its value.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation unicorn UiPath is set to go public this week, concentrating our focus on its value.</p>
<p>The well-known company was last valued on the private markets at $35 billion in February when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">closed a $750 million round</a>. Living up to that price as a public company, however, at least when it comes to its formal IPO price, is proving to be challenging.</p>
<p>In a sense, that&#8217;s not too surprising given that the red-hot IPO market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">cooled as Q1 2021 came to a close</a>. UiPath raised its last private round when the markets were most interested in public offerings and is now going public in a slightly altered climate.</p>
<p>In numerical terms, UiPath <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521120347/d98556ds1a.htm">raised its IPO range</a> from $43 to $50 per share, to $52 to $54 per share. That&#8217;s a 21% jump in the value of the lower end of its range, and an 8% gain to the value of the upper end of its per-share IPO price interval.</p>
<p>UiPath is also selling more shares than before, which should make its total valuation slightly larger at the top end than a mere 8% gain. So let&#8217;s go through the math one more time. Afterward, we&#8217;ll stack its new simple, fully diluted IPO valuations against its final private price, ask ourselves if our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">musings on the company&#8217;s recent profitability bore out</a>, and close by asking where the company might finally price, and if we expect it to do so above its new price range.</p>
<h2>UiPath at $54<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a strange few years for Fitbit. After defining the fitness tracking space, the company was a bit late to the smartwatch trend, but was still able to ride that wave to a rebound. But while watches have received most of the press the now Google-owned company has garnered in recent years, bands still comprise a substantial part of its business.</p>
<p>Today Fitbit announced the arrival of the Luxe. It’s a weird product. There’s certainly a market for it, but it’s hard to say how much of a niche were talking about here. The company called its target demo, “a unique set of buyers whose needs weren’t being met.” Specifically, the product is a “fashioned-forward” tracker for people looking for something a bit nicer than a plastic band to wear out and about.</p>
<p>Frankly, it’s hard not to see some reflections of Misfit’s take on the category. Perhaps the Fossil-owned company was ahead of its time. At $149, the device is priced between the Charge and the Versa, but decidedly closer to the former. That is to say, it’s pricey in the grand scheme of fitness trackers, but more or less in line with other Fitbit products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It is, indeed, a nice-looking tracker, as far of these things go, featuring a color touchscreen surrounded by a stainless steel case. That’s coupled with a broad range of accessories, ranging from leather to gold-colored stainless steel.</p>
<p>Here’s Fitbit co-founder and GM (under Google) James Park:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past year, we’ve had to think differently about our health – from keeping an eye out for possible COVID-19 symptoms to managing the ongoing stress and anxiety of today’s world. Even though we are starting to see positive changes, it has never been more important to manage your holistic health. That’s why we’ve been resolute in introducing products to support you in staying mentally well and physically active. We’ve made major technological advancements with Luxe, creating a smaller, slimmer, beautifully designed tracker packed with advanced features – some that were previously only available with our smartwatches – making these tools accessible to even more people around the globe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly physical and mental health have been top of mind over the past year, even as step counts have dramatically plummeted. The device sports the usual array of Fitbit sensors, tracking activity, sleep and stress. It also works with a number of different mindfulness/meditation apps, including the company’s recently announced partnership with Deepak Chopra.</p>
<p>The band is up for preorder starting today and starts shipping in the spring.</p>
