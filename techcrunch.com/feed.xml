										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BreachQuest, an early-stage startup with a founding team of cybersecurity experts building a modern <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/incident-response/">incident response</a> platform, has emerged from stealth with $4.4 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The investment was raised from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/slow-ventures/">Slow Ventures</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/lookout/">Lookout</a> founder Kevin Mahaffey, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tinder/">Tinder</a> co-founders Sean Rad and Justin Mateen, who described BreachQuest as having a “disruptive vision and a world-class team.”</p>
<p>The latter is certainly true. BreachQuest is made up of former U.S. Cyber Command, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nsa/">National Security Agency</a>, and Department of Defense employees that it sees as its biggest competitive advantage. The second is its Priori platform, which the Texas-based company believes will re-engineer the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/incident-response/">incident response</a> process and move incident preparedness into the future.</p>
<p>Currently, it takes most organizations thereabouts 280 days to detect a breach, the startup says, and the slow recovery process that typically follows means this largely manual process costs the average U.S. business just shy of $4 million. The startup&#8217;s Priori platform uses aims to improve on what the team sees as “unacceptable industry standards,” enabling organizations to detect intrusions and compromises far faster. That allows companies to near-instantly respond and contain the compromise, the startup says.</p>
<p>BreachQuest’s co-founder and CTO is Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and founder of Rendition Infosec, an Augusta, Ga.-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> company that was acquired by BreachQuest. Williams told TechCrunch that while most other incident response firms are focused on preventing incidents, BreachQuest is focusing on preparing for the inevitable.</p>
<p>“It’s a reality that determined adversaries will get into your network regardless of what tools you put in place to keep them out,” he says. “That’s not [fear, uncertainty and doubt], it’s just a reality that if you’re targeted you’re going to be compromised. That’s what our mission is all about: preparation to facilitate response.”</p>
<p>BreachQuest, which will also assess the cybersecurity risks posed to an organization by potential <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mergers-and-acquisitions/">mergers and acquisitions</a>, believes it has little competition in the market right now because incident preparation is a tough market.</p>
<p>“We continuously see statistics about how IT managers think their security controls will prevent them from being breached, so selling incident response preparation tools and services to those organizations is a hard sell,” Williams said. “But given the landscape of ransomware and other cybersecurity threats being regular front-page news, we think the market is ready.”</p>
<p>BreachQuest will use its $4.4 million seed investment to accelerate the rollout and development of its Priori platform, with future plans to speed up its forensic evidence collection processes and improve response coordination across its disparate team members.</p>
<p>&#8220;Incident response is chaotic and it’s hard for people who infrequently work in these situations to address all the issues identified throughout the investigation,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;Fundamentally, the problem is a combination of the difficulties getting the right evidence in a timely manner and understanding the status of the response.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, MaxAB, the Egyptian B2B e-commerce platform that serves food and grocery retailers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/maxab-the-egyptian-b2b-food-and-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-40m-for-expansion/">raised one of the largest Series A on the continent</a>, to the tune of $40 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, it has raised a $15 million extension from existing investors &#8212; RMBV, IFC, Flourish Ventures, Crystal Stream Capital, Rise Capital, Endeavour Catalyst, Beco Capital and 4DX Ventures &#8212;  bringing its total Series A fundraise to $55 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded by</span><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/belal-el-megharbel-34718023"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Belal El-Megharbel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-ben-halim-46072511a"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohamed Ben Halim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018, manages procurement and grocery delivery to shops in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Store owners can use the platform to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goods, request delivery or logistics to move the goods, and access a customer support team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CEO El-Megharbel spoke to TechCrunch during its first Series A tranche, he said MaxAB, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">operates in Egypt alone, was looking to expand across the Middle East and North Africa besides launching new product offerings and growing its team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s announcement marks MaxAB&#8217;s first step toward regional scale. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is announcing the acquisition of Morocco-based B2B e-commerce and distribution platform WaystoCap for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niama El Bassunie co-founded WaystoCap with Mehdi Daoui, Anis Abdeddine and Aziz Jaouhari Tissafi in 2015. The company was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">originally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a cross-border trade platform for transacting business goods in Africa. That business model got WaystoCap into Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter batch in 2017, making it the first company accepted from Morocco. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/waystocap-raises-3m/"> raised a $3 million</a> seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WaystoCap took its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/07/waystocap-africa-cross-border/">cross-border services</a> to Ivory Coast and Togo, and at some point, was processing over $3 million worth of transactions per quarter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since its pivot to a similar model to MaxAB, in that it connects retailers with suppliers across Morocco, WaystoCap has pulled out from both countries while growing to a network of over 8,000 retailers in Morocco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El-Megharbel mentioned to TechCrunch that MaxAB&#8217;s plan to move into Morocco coincided with WaystoCap&#8217;s bid to raise new funding (the last time the company took venture capital was in 2017) and push further into the Moroccan market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But both companies agreed to work together rather than compete with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love the team. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They share the same values and they&#8217;re on a mission that is using a tech-enabled supply chain to optimize food distribution across the continent,&#8221; he said in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;For us, our strategy is to build a global team that can think local and execute </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">properly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And we figured out that they&#8217;re already a perfect fit for that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the acquisition signals MaxAB&#8217;s move into Morocco, it also shows the company&#8217;s entry into the Maghreb markets &#8212; Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia, where there&#8217;s little or no contest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MaxAB says more than 70,000 retailers across both platforms will &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefit from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its technology, expanded end-to-end supply chain solutions and business intelligence tools as well as WaystoCap’s knowledge and expertise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Bassunie will take over the position as the managing director at MaxAB Morocco. Commenting on the acquisition of her startup, she said, “&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are thrilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to play a pivotal role in the new all-star team </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and led by experienced, innovative entrepreneurs to establish a regional market leader in food and grocery supply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are looking forward to continuing our close working relationship with our new team and taking the business to its next phase.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Maghreb market is new territory for MaxAB and the acquisition positions it as the most funded and largest B2B e-commerce platform for retailers and suppliers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morocco’s growing tech hub offers huge potential and the acquisition of WaystoCap empowers MaxAB to become a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global team with a targeted local approach, setting the company on track to be the leading B2B retail and grocery platform in the Middle East and Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the end of the day, what we want to do is build a tech-enabled supply chain, in all the African countries, in the Middle Eastern countries, and then connect them together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That&#8217;s where the magic happens. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where we can actually have a real impact by putting the right amount of food at the right place at the right time, and minimizing the waste which MENA cannot afford,&#8221; said MaxAB CEO El-Meghabel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MaxAB&#8217;s acquisition of WaystoCap is the second local cross-border acquisition that has played out in Africa this week</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Nigeria and Canada-based mobility startup Plentywaka announced the acquisition of Stabus, its counterpart in Ghana, for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a narrower consolidation perspective, Kenyan consumer experience platform Ajua acquired Kenyan AI and ML messaging and payments company WayaWaya, early in April</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WaystoCap is also the second YC-backed company in Africa to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exit,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Paystack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">got bought by Stripe</a> for more than $200 million last October</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marathon.edu.vn/">Marathon Education</a> was created after its founders realized after-school education in Vietnam hadn’t evolved much since they were kids. Some of the most popular tuition centers in big cities teach hundreds of students at once. “They’re packed like sardines and that really has not changed in the past one or two decades when I went to these sorts of classes in Vietnam,” said co-founder Pham Duc.</p>
<p>Pham launched Marathon six weeks ago with his brother-in-law Tran Viet Tung to make after-school learning more accessible in Vietnam. Today the startup is announcing it has raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding led by Forge Ventures (a new fund launched by Alto Partners), with participation from investors including Venturra Discovery and iSeed SEA.</p>
<p>Marathon is currently focused on math and science courses for grades six to 12 of the National Curriculum developed by Vietnam’s Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), and will eventually cover all MOET subjects.</p>
<p>Before founding Marathon, Pham was an investor at TPG Global, while Tran is a serial entrepreneur whose previous startups include travel platforms Triip.me and Christina’s. Both grew up in Hanoi and spent much of their childhoods going to after-school learning centers.</p>
<p>About 50% to 70% of K-12 students attend after-school classes, but the industry is very fragmented, says Pham. Many learning centers are run by former public school teachers, and are clustered in major cities.</p>
<p>“If you speak to students, I think the biggest issue we’re seeing is accessibility,” said Pham. “If you’re a student in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, there’s no guarantee that you’ll get into classes run by top tutors.” Meanwhile, students in other areas often travel to Tier 1 cities before major tests, like university entrance exams, staying in a hostel for about a month while attending prep courses.</p>
<p>For teachers, running a center means handling administrative tasks like marketing, admissions and parent communications, which cuts into the time they spend designing their courses. When the current COVID-19 lockdowns started a few months ago, they had to switch quickly to online teaching platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When teachers join Marathon, the company takes over administrative tasks. Its online model also means they can reach more students, including in other cities. Pham says teachers who switch from offline centers to Marathon can potentially increase their earnings two to three times.</p>

<p>Before joining Marathon, teachers go through a screening process, including how many of they previous students passed exams or improved their grades. Marathon pairs them with teaching assistants who work directly with groups of about 20 to 25 students during online lectures, answering questions through instant messenger, and then manage breakout rooms to go through the lessons in detail.</p>
<p>Marathon launched first in Ho Chi Minh City and its expansion strategy will take cultural differences between the north and south of Vietnam into account. For example, it will find tutors with regional accents, and adjust its marketing strategies.</p>
<p>“We are going to focus on the teachers and curriculum separately, because the two regions are quite different. Parents in the south are more experimental and more willing to try out new services. Parents in the north very much rely on their network and word-of-mouth, so they are more cautious about trying out what we’re doing,” Tran said. “So when we serve the north and south, we serve distinctive sets of customers.”</p>
<p>Marathon plans to continue its online-only model after lockdowns end and kids go back to in-person classes for regular school. “After one year in intermittent lockdowns, we’ve noticed there’s been a marked shift in parents’ behavior. They are much more receptive to online learning. Right now, even though there’s a lockdown, attendance rates are 99%,” said Pham. “In the future, I think online is the way to go and it’s much more scalable, so we want to focus our strategy around that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It hasn&#8217;t even been a week since Tesla hosted its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/">AI Day</a>, a livestreamed event full of technical jargon meant to snare the choicest of AI and vision engineers to come work for Tesla and help the company achieve autonomous greatness, and already CEO Elon Musk is coming in with some hot takes about the &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; (FSD) tech.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just drove FSD Beta 9.3 from Pasadena to LAX. Much improved!</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1430038942909272071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a tweet on Tuesday, Musk said: &#8220;FSD Beta 9.2 is actually not great imo, but Autopilot/AI team is rallying to improve as fast as possible. We&#8217;re trying to have a single tech stack for both highway &amp; city streets, but it requires massive [neural network] retraining.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an important point. Many others in the autonomous space have mirrored this sentiment. Don Burnette, co-founder and CEO of Kodiak Robotics, says his company is exclusively focused on trucking for the moment because it&#8217;s a much easier problem to solve. In a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/kodiak-robotics-founder-says-tight-focus-on-autonomous-trucks-is-working/">Extra Crunch interview</a>, Burnette said:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the unique aspects of our tech is that it’s highly customized for a specific goal. We don’t have this constant requirement that we maintain really high truck highway performance while at the same time really high dense urban passenger car performance, all within the same stack and system. Theoretically it’s certainly possible to create a generic solution for all driving in all conditions under all form factors, but it’s certainly a much harder problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because Tesla is only using optical cameras, scorning lidar and radar, &#8220;massive&#8221; neural network training as a requirement is not an understatement at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the sympathy we all feel for the AI and vision team that may undoubtedly be feeling a bit butthurt by Musk&#8217;s tweet, this is a singular moment of clarity and honesty for Musk. Usually, we have to filter Tesla news about its autonomy with a fine-tuned BS meter, one that beeps wildly with every mention of its &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; technology. Which, for the record, is not at all full self-driving; it&#8217;s just advanced driver assistance that could, we grant, lay the groundwork for better autonomy in the future.</p>
<p>Musk followed up the tweet by saying that he just drove the FSD Beta 9.3 from Pasadena to LAX, a ride that was &#8220;much improved!&#8221; Do we buy it? Musk is ever the optimist. At the start of the month, Musk said Tesla would be releasing new versions of its FSD every two weeks at midnight California time. Then he promised that Beta 9.2 would be &#8220;tight,&#8221; saying that radar was holding the company back and now that it&#8217;s fully accepted pure vision, progress will go much faster.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is always a lot of cleanup after a major code release. Beta 9.2 will be tight. </p>
<p>Still some fundamentals to solve for Beta 10, but now that we’re pure vision, progress is much faster. Radar was holding us back.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421564618258931715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Perhaps Musk is just trying to deflect against the flurry of bad press about the FSD system. Last week,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/"> U.S. auto regulators opened a preliminary investigation into Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot</a>, citing 11 incidents in which vehicles crashed into parked first responder vehicles. Why first responder vehicles in particular, we don&#8217;t know. But according to <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF">investigation documents</a> posted on the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration’s website, most of the incidents took place after dark. Poor night vision is definitely a thing with many human drivers, but those kinds of incidents just won&#8217;t fly in the world of autonomous driving.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/airbnb-to-provide-free-temporary-housing-for-20000-afghan-refugees/">Airbnb to house 20,000 Afghan refugees:</a> </strong>Corporate gimmicks are hollow gestures at best. What Airbnb is promising is the opposite. By offering free housing to tens of thousands of refugees from Afghanistan, the company is using its business network for material good. Other wealthy tech companies, what are you going to do?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">Ramp raises $300M at $3.9B valuation:</a> </strong>The startup war to own the growing corporate spend market heated up even more today with Ramp raising fresh funds. Brex and Ramp and Airbase are locked in a multiparty duel after erstwhile competitor Divvy sold to Bill.com. Ramp also made its first acquisition, it announced.</li>
<li>For more on the Ramp-Brex rivalry, and what their acquisitions may detail about their diverging strategies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-and-brex-draw-diverging-market-plans-with-ma-strategy/">head here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bostons-startup-market-is-more-than-setting-records-in-scorching-start-to-year/">Boom times in Beantown:</a> </strong>The global startup scene is accelerating, but few markets have turned on the afterburners to the same degree as Boston. The venerable startup hub is putting up record venture capital tallies across more rounds than ever. And a bevy of local investors don’t see the momentum slowing in coming quarters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>So much happened in the last 24 hours that we’re forced to proceed in sections. Make sure you are following <a href="https://twitter.com/techcrunch">TechCrunch on Twitter</a> so that you can stay up to date all day long.</p>
<p>We start in India:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bankers-chase-byjus-for-ipo-valuation-pegged-up-to-50-billion/"><strong>Bankers hunt Byju’s:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Its IPO, that is. Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc/">Manish Singh</a>, bankers are pitching the famous edtech startup, hoping to secure a piece of its future IPO action. And the numbers being thrown around are truly astounding: “Most banks have given Byju’s a proposed valuation in the range of $40 billion to $45 billion, but some including Morgan Stanley have pitched a $50 billion valuation if the startup lists next year,” he writes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/indias-khatabook-raises-100-million-for-its-bookkeeping-platform-for-merchants/"><strong>Khatabook raises $100M more:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Now valued at around $600 million, Khatabook’s business of digitizing India’s myriad SMBs is doing well, it appears. The company’s fresh Series C will help power its 10 million monthly active users, and likely help it expand its staff of 200 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>To lead us into startup rounds more generally, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> published an article today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/noredink-raises-50-million-series-b-to-help-students-become-better-writers/">digging into NoRedInk’s huge $50 million Series B</a>. Its goal is to help students become better writers. I asked her why she picked the round to cover, to which she said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Usually, I see edtech companies working on subjects that have one right answer, or at least can be sorted into a single category the way STEM or coding often are. NoRedInk caught my eye because it wants to bring tech to a highly emotional and subjective subject: writing. That&#8217;s a hard challenge, but it&#8217;s cool to see the education community bet on ambitious projects beyond teaching more students to code.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next up we have a few regular startup bulletins:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/substack-acqui-hires-team-behind-subscription-social-app-cocoon/"><strong>Substack buys the team behind Cocoon:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Substack is having quite the week. After hiring a general counsel, the startup announced that it has acquired the team at Cocoon, what TechCrunch described as “subscription social media app built for close friends.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/icon-lands-207m-series-b-to-construct-more-3d-printed-homes-after-400-yoy-revenue-growth/"><strong>Maybe 3D-printed homes will be a thing?</strong></a> Investors are betting that they will be, pouring $207 million into ICON after its 3D-printed home business saw revenue growth of 400%. In realistic terms, we have a national housing crisis. So if this leads to more, cheaper homes, it’s hard to oppose.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/soras-hr-automation-software-raises-14m-series-a/"><strong>Sora raises $14M for HR ops automation:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sora is back this year with a fresh capital raise, after scaling its customers by 7x and revenues by 8x since its 2020 seed round. Now flush with Series A cash, the startup has big plans to grow its team and double down on making the HR tech stack work in concert, cutting out busywork as it does so.</li>
<li>And in a slightly related area, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tango-dances-in-with-5-7m-to-making-employee-onboarding-easier/"><strong>Tango announced that it has raised $5.7 million to grow its process documentation service</strong></a>. The startup watches how employees execute a particular task, and then creates a how-to guide so that others can follow in their footsteps. For new employees, especially in a remote world, it could be a neat service.</li>
<li>Finally from startupland, Sara Mauskopf (CEO and co-founder of Winnie) and Elana Berkowitz (founding partner at Springbank Collective) <strong><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/its-time-for-the-vc-community-to-stop-overlooking-the-childcare-industry/">wrote an essay for TechCrunch</a></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> noting that one industry in particular is huge, yet somehow devoid of venture dollars: childcare.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Back to the suture: The future of healthcare is in the home</h2>
<p>It was once common practice for doctors to visit sick patients in their homes: In 1930, 40% of all consultations were house calls. By 1980, that figure was less than 1%.</p>
<p>Today, urgent care centers occupy Main Street storefronts and 33% of medical expenditures occur in hospitals. This leads to higher prices, but not necessarily better results, according to Sumi Das and Nina Gerson, who lead healthcare investments at Capital G.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can improve both outcomes and costs by moving care from the hospital back to the place it started — at home,&#8221; they write in a post that explores <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/back-to-the-suture-the-future-of-healthcare-is-in-the-home/">five innovations enabling at-home care</a> and identifies investment opportunities like acute care and infrastructure development.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Kicking off our Big Tech rundown today, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/how-cisco-keeps-its-startup-acquisition-engine-humming/?tpcc=ECTW2020">neat look into how Cisco makes acquisitions</a>. The dotcom boom company is among the most acquisitive companies in the world, making its approach to snagging startup talent and products worth understanding.</p>
<p>And now, the crush of Big Tech news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/nso-pegasus-bahrain-iphone-security/"><strong>Your iPhone isn’t safe from this spyware:</strong></a> That’s the gist of the latest Zack Whittaker story, delving into how a zero-click attack executed by NSO software broke the security of a “Bahraini human rights activist’s iPhone.” Not good!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/peloton-tread-arrives-next-week-with-enhanced-safety-features-following-recall/"><strong>Peloton’s Tread is back, hopefully safer:</strong></a> One of the weirder self-inflicted wounds in the world of exercise tech came when Peloton tried to argue that its treadmills were safe. They weren’t. Peloton eventually relented and offered a recall. Now they are back!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/"><strong>TikTok keeps making business moves:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This time the social giant is moving further into e-commerce, it announced today, detailing an expanded partnership with Shopify. A service called TikTok Shopping is also coming to the U.S., the U.K. and Canada.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/"><strong>All U.S. podcasters can now access Spotify’s subscription option:</strong></a> Paid podcasting is big in China, but less popular elsewhere in the world. Spotify is betting that the model will have legs into other markets as well. Now all U.S. podcasters can access the paid service if they so choose.</li>
<li>To round us out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/waymo-launches-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/"><strong>Waymo is rolling out its self-driving car service to San Francisco</strong></a>. Given the City by the Bay’s inability to ever finish a roadworks project, this is big news. As someone who doesn’t want to drive, that’s great news.</li>

In a society that runs on social media, however, people expect to see trends land on store shelves much more quickly. Founded in 2018, <a href="https://www.aipalette.com/">Ai Palette</a> uses machine learning to help companies spot trends in real time and get them retail-ready, often within a few months. The startup, whose clients include Danone, Kellogg’s, Cargill and Dole, announced today it has raised an oversubscribed $4.4 million Series A co-led by pi Ventures and Exfinity Venture Partners. Both will join Ai Palette’s board.</p>
<p>The round also included participation from returning backers food tech venture firm AgFunder and Decacorn Capital, and new investor Anthill Ventures. It brings Ai Palette’s total raised to $5.5 million, including a seed round <a href="https://e27.co/exclusive-foodtech-startup-ai-palette-gets-us1m-seed-funding-from-decacorn-capital-others-20190823/">announced in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Ai Palette is based in Singapore, with an engineering hub in Bangalore. Its customer base started in Southeast Asia, before expanding into China, Japan, the United States and Europe.</p>

<p>Its customer base started in Southeast Asia and India, and expanded to China, Japan, the United States and Europe. Ai Palette supports 15 languages, which the company claims is the most of any AI-based tool for predicting consumer packaged goods (CPG) trends. Its funding will be used to expand into more markets and fill engineering and data science roles.</p>
<p>Ai Palette was founded in 2018 by chief executive officer Somsubhra GanChoudhuri and chief technology officer Himanshu Upreti, who met through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/a-lof-of-efffing-money/">Entrepreneur First</a>, the “talent investor” that recruits and teams up potential founders.</p>
<p>Before Ai Palette, GanChoudhuri worked in sales and marketing at Givaudan, the world’s largest manufacturer of fragrances and flavors. This allowed him to see how product innovation is done for many types of consumer products, ranging from snacks and fast food to packaged goods. Many of the companies he worked with were beginning to realize that a two-year product innovation cycle could no longer meet demand. Upreti, an advanced machine learning and big data analysis expert, previously worked at companies including Visa, where he built models that can handle petabytes of data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EF raises $115M new fund, aiming to create another 300-plus startups in the next three years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/a-lof-of-efffing-money/embed/#?secret=uk2edHerlt" data-secret="uk2edHerlt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ai Palette’s first product is Foresight Engine, which tracks trends like ingredients or flavors, analyzes why they are popular and predicts how long demand will last. It also identifies “white space opportunities,” or situations where there is unmet demand. For example, GanChoudhuri said the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people eat — they are now eating health snacks up to six times a day in front of screens — so companies have the chance to release new kinds of products.</p>
<p>Foresight Engine gives contextual information, said Upreti. “For example, is a food item eaten on the go, or at a café. Is a product consumed socially or individually? What’s trending at kids’ birthday parties? For a specific product or ingredient, images provide information on product pairings and product format.”</p>
<p>The platform uses data from sources like social media, search, blogs, recipes, menus and company data. “Data sets popular to each market are prioritized, like a local recipe or a food delivery app,” said GanChoudhuri. “And they are tracked over the years to determine growth trajectory with a strong degree of confidence.”</p>
<p>Some specific examples of how Ai Palette’s tech has translated into new products include brands that want to launch a new flavor, like for a potato chip or soda, in a specific country. They can use the Foresight Engine to not only see what trends are rising, but which ones have the potential to become long-term favorites, so they don’t invest in a product that will almost instantly lose its popularity.</p>
<p>Many of Ai Palette’s clients have used it to react to new trends and consumer behavior patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not surprisingly, people in many markets are interested in healthy food or ones that are supposed to boost immunity. For example, in Southeast Asia there is more demand for lemon and garlic, while acerola and yerba mate are trending in the United States.</p>
<p>On the other hand, “in China, taste is paramount, even over health, because people are looking for food that brings back a sense of normalcy,” said GanChoudhuri. Meanwhile in India, there is demand for products with longer shelf life as people continue to cope with the pandemic, but many consumers are also seeking interesting snacks to ease the boredom of lockdown, with kimchi and other Korean flavors becoming especially popular.</p>
<p>Ai Palette’s ability to work with many languages is one of the ways it differentiates from other machine learning-based trend-prediction platforms. It currently supports English, simplified Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Bahasa Indonesian, Bahasa Melayu, Tagalog, Spanish, French and German, with plans to add more as it targets new European countries, Mexico, Latin America and the Middle East.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When is the last time your doctor treated you at home?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was once common practice for doctors to visit sick patients in their homes: In 1930, 40% of all consultations were house calls. By 1980, that figure was less than 1%.</p>
<p>Today, urgent care centers occupy Main Street storefronts and 33% of all medical expenditures occur in hospitals. It&#8217;s clear that the additional overhead is generating higher prices, but not necessarily better results, according to Sumi Das and Nina Gerson, who lead healthcare investments at Capital G.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can improve both outcomes and costs by moving care from the hospital back to the place it started — at home,&#8221; they write in a post that explores <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/back-to-the-suture-the-future-of-healthcare-is-in-the-home/">five innovations enabling at-home care</a> and identifies investment opportunities like acute care and infrastructure development.</p>
<p>Today, in-home care comprises just 3% of overall healthcare spending, but Gerson and Das estimate that will expand to 10% in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make these improvements, in-home healthcare strategies will need to leverage next-generation technology and value-based care strategies. Fortunately, the window of opportunity for change is open right now.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Zūm CEO Ritu Narayan explains why equity and accessibility works for mobility services</h2>

<p>Ritu Narayan founded Zūm with her two brothers in 2016 to disrupt student transportation, a space that hasn&#8217;t seen much innovation since pupils began finding their way to and from little red schoolhouses.</p>
<p>Since then, Zūm has inked partnerships with school districts around the country to create more efficient routes and reduce vehicle emissions.</p>
<p>By 2025, Narayan says her company will have 10,000 electric school buses and plans to put the fleet into service to generate power and feed it back to the grid.</p>
<p>To learn more about the company&#8217;s development, its immediate plans for the future and how the pandemic impacted operations, read on.</p>

<p>For The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm looked at recent financial data from scooter sharing service Bird, which &#8212; like Lyft, Uber, Airbnb and others &#8212; took a beating during the pandemic as potential riders stayed home.</p>
<p>Bird flipped its business model and its results improved, but it still has a ways to go. “In the bull case, Bird can get rid of its adjusted losses in a few years,” Alex writes.</p>
<p>“If any issues arise at the top of the company’s table — say, for example, that rides per scooter do not scale as the company rolls out more hardware, or merely slower than expected — the anticipated profitability results could evaporate or be pushed into the future.”</p>

<p>By 2030, India&#8217;s SaaS industry is estimated to comprise 4%-6% of the global market and generate between $50 billion and $70 billion in yearly revenue, according to a SaaSBOOMi/McKinsey report.</p>
<p>“With the right approach, it won’t be long before the Indian SaaS community becomes a large-scale employer of talent, a significant contributor to India’s GDP and a creator of unmatched products,&#8221; says Manav Garg, CEO and founder of Eka Software Solutions.</p>
<p>In a guest post, he lays out several key growth drivers, which include &#8220;the largest concentration of developers in the world&#8221; and the fact that &#8220;SaaS is not a winner-take-all market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even so, the region still faces challenges, since &#8220;growth requires a growth mindset.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Alex Wilhelm has repeatedly noted in The Exchange, neoinsurance companies, from healthcare to auto to home and rental, have taken a whacking by the market.</p>
<p>But he hadn’t quite figured out why until he chatted with Pie Insurance co-founder and CEO John Swigart, who had an interesting hypothesis.</p>

<p>Ron Miller interviewed three Cisco executives to learn more about the company&#8217;s “rich history of buying its way to global success”:</p>
<ul>
<li>CFO Scott Herren</li>
<li>Derek Idemoto, SVP for corporate development and Cisco investments</li>
<li>Jeetu Patel, EVP and GM, Security and Collaboration</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its founding, Cisco has acquired 229 companies, buying more than 30 startups in the last four years that focus on everything from edtech to event management.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, one of the big reasons for all these acquisitions could be about maintaining growth,&#8221; writes Ron.</p>

<p>“Inflation may or may not prove transitory when it comes to consumer prices, but startup valuations are definitely rising — and noticeably so — in recent quarters.”</p>
<p>That’s Alex Wilhelm’s summation of a recent PitchBook report rounding up valuation data from U.S. startup funding events.</p>
<p>He dug into the report and analyzed what the numbers mean for startup valuations and potential exits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://moviesanywhere.com/">Movies Anywhere</a>, an app that allows you to centralize your digital movie collection from across services, is rolling out a new feature that will help you make better sense of your growing library. The company today introduced an AI-powered feature called &#8220;My Lists,&#8221; which automatically groups movies together based on any number of factors &#8212; like genre, actors, franchise, theme and more.</p>
<p>For digital movie collectors with larger libraries, the feature could make browsing through the available options feel more like scrolling through the recommendations you&#8217;d find on a modern-day streaming service, like Netflix. That is, instead of scrolling down through endless pages showing you all your purchased movies in order of purchase or alphabetically, as before, you can now quickly scan rows where the content is organized in ways that make it easier to discover what&#8217;s actually in your library.</p>
<p>For example, if you had purchased all the movies from a particular franchise, they would now be on their own row together. This is an improvement over how you had to locate these movies in your collection before &#8212; where they&#8217;d be sandwiched between the other titles you bought in between the franchise purchases.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u32yo8loS5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/streaming-services-face-their-real-test-in-2021/">Streaming services face their real test in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Streaming services face their real test in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/streaming-services-face-their-real-test-in-2021/embed/#?secret=u32yo8loS5" data-secret="u32yo8loS5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You may also discover that you own a lot of movies within a particular category, like &#8220;Action Thrillers,&#8221; or those with a central theme, like &#8220;strong female friendships,&#8221; which could help you narrow down your movie night selection.</p>
<p>These algorithmically created lists can also be edited, allowing you to add or remove titles &#8212; or even delete the list altogether.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2193535" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2193535" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2193535" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="490" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg 1737w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=768,553 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=680,490 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=1536,1106 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/movies-anywhere-my-lists.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2193535" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Movies Anywhere</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plus, you can now make lists of your own, too. So you could make a list of favorites, movies you want to watch with your family, or however else you want to further organize your collection. You could even use the feature to make a &#8220;to watch&#8221; list of movies you&#8217;ve purchased, but hadn&#8217;t yet made time for.</p>
<p>The Movie Anywhere app has been around for years, but is now jointly operated by Disney, Universal, WB, Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox, after migrating to a new platform back in 2017. Its biggest selling point for digital movie collectors is that you can in one place get to all the movies you bought from various services. That includes digital downloads offered by iTunes, Vudu, Prime Video, YouTube, Xfinity and others. Before, you would have to switch from app to app to figure out if you had ever purchased a given title.</p>
<p>My Lists is one of many features the company has added over time to keep its app feeling current. Last year, for instance, it introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/movies-anywhere-officially-launches-its-digital-movie-lending-feature-screen-pass/">digital movie lending feature called Screen Pass</a>, and it earlier had launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/movies-anywhere-watch-together-parties-163017748.html">co-watching feature called Watch Together</a>, which let users watch with up to nine friends.</p>
<p>The new My Lists is available today in the Movies Anywhere mobile app, desktop and on streaming devices from the navigation bar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Linktree, the popular “link in bio” service with more than 16 million users, is partnering with PayPal to expand its recently <a href="https://help.linktr.ee/en/support/solutions/articles/48001172633-what-are-commerce-links-">launched “Commerce Links” tools</a> for direct payment on Linktree globally. The Melbourne-based startup says creators in over 200 countries where PayPal operates can now accept payments through the transaction tools.</p>
<p>Launched in March, Commerce Links allow users to take payments directly on their Linktree profile without opening a new browser or tab. The new integration lets Linktree customers connect their PayPal account and receive payments from their followers or customers via PayPal, a debit card or a credit card. Linktree notes users can also access information regarding their transactions, payment conversion rate and more. The company says the available relevant data is meant to help creators manage their digital presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the creator economy grows, creators want new ways to collect payments and support from their audience with as little friction as possible,&#8221; said Linktree co-founder and CEO Alex Zaccaria in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to be collaborating with PayPal to further expand our solutions to our users globally and enable them to further manage and monetize their digital presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are two types of Commerce Links that creators can use to take payments from their followers and customers: A “Support Me Link” allows Linktree users to collect payments and donations from their visitors, while “Request Links” lets customers and followers request goods and services from creators directly from their Linktree profile.</p>
<p>Linktree says its collaboration with PayPal is the latest in a series of creator-focused efforts. The partnership announcement comes days after Linktree announced its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linktree-announces-acquisition-of-songlinkodesli-and-launches-music-link-feature-301358565.html">acquisition of automated music link aggregation platform Songlink/Odesli</a>. Linktree is integrating Songlink/Odesli into its newly launched “Music Link” feature, which automatically displays the same song or album across all music streaming services to let users listen to content on their preferred platform.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Linktree now competes with several “link in bio” platforms, including Shorby, Linkin.bio and Beacons. In March, Linktree announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/">raised $45 million in Series B funding</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ForgeRock</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">filed its form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this morning as the identity management provider takes the next step toward its IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company did not provide initial pricing for its shares, which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FORG. The IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., with the company being valued as high as $4 billion, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/digital-identity-startup-forgerock-files-ipo-as-losses-shrink">Bloomberg</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is a significant uplift over the $730 million post-money value that</span><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">PitchBook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had for the company after its last round in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity attacks against organizations of all sizes, the need to secure and manage user identities is of growing importance. Based in San Francisco, ForgeRock has raised $233 million in funding across multiple rounds. The company&#8217;s last round was a</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/forgerock-nabs-93-5m-for-its-id-management-platform-gears-up-next-for-an-ipo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$93.5 million Series E</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced in April 2020, which was led by Riverwood Capital alongside Accenture Ventures. At that time, CEO Fran Rosch told TechCrunch that the round would be the last before an IPO, which was also what former CEO Mike Ellis told us after the startup&#8217;s</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/identity-startup-forgerock-lands-88-million-series-d-investment/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$88 million Series D</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the timing of its IPO might have been unclear over the last few years, the company has been on a positive trajectory for growth. In its</span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543916/000119312521254144/d127368ds1.htm"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">S-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ForgeRock reported that as of June 30, its annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $155 million, representing 30% year-over-year growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While revenue is growing, losses are narrowing as the company reported a $20 million net loss down from $36 million a year ago. There certainly is a whole lot of room to grow, as the company estimates that the total global addressable market for identity services to be worth $71 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the many competitors that ForgeRock faces is Okta, which went public in 2017 and has been growing in the years since. In March, Okta</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cloud identity startup Auth0 for $6.5 billion in a deal that</span> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/making-sense-of-the-6-5b-okta-auth0-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a few eyebrows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another competitor is Ping Identity, which went public in 2019 and is also growing, reporting on August 4 that its ARR hit $279.6 million in its quarter ended June 30, for a 19% year-over-year gain. There have also been a few big exits in the space over the years, including Duo Security, which was</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/02/cisco-is-buying-duo-security-for-2-35b-in-cash/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired by Cisco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for $2.35 billion in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ForgeRock has a good access management tool and they continue to be a strong player in customer identity and access management (CIAM),” commented Michael Kelley, senior research director at Gartner.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelley noted that in 2020, ForgeRock converted most of its core access management services to a SaaS delivery model, which helped the company catch up with the rest of the market that already offered access management as SaaS. Also last year the company expanded into identity governance, introducing a brand new identity, governance and administration (IGA) product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think one of the more interesting products that ForgeRock offers is ForgeRock Trees, which is a no-code/low-code orchestration tool for building complex authentication and authorization journeys for customers, which is particularly helpful in the CIAM market,” Kelly added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ForgeRock was founded in 2010, but its roots go back even further to an open-source single sign-on project known as OpenSSO that was created by Sun Microsystems in 2005. When Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in early 2010, a number of its open-source efforts were left to languish, which is what led a number of former Sun employees to start ForgeRock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, ForgeRock has expanded significantly beyond just providing a single sign-on to providing an identity platform that can handle consumer, enterprise and IoT use-cases. The company&#8217;s platform today handles identity and access management as well as identity governance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to scale is a key selling point that ForgeRock makes in the S-1, noting that its platform can handle over 60,000 user-based access transactions per second per customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As of June 30, 2021, we had four customers with 100 million or more licensed identities, the company stated in the S-1. &#8220;Our ability to serve mission-critical needs in complex environments for large customers enables us to grow our base of large customers and expand within each of them. &#8220;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following its announcement late last month, Facebook’s new 128GB model of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Oculus Quest 2</a> is now available to buy. You can purchase the VR headset from the <a href="https://fave.co/3fdK4b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Oculus;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:company’s website" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">company’s website</a> for the same $299 price as the previous 64GB base model. “Long story short? We’ve created this 128GB model so that players can easily store and access more games and apps on a single device,” Facebook says of the new variant.</p>
<p>Facebook announced the 128GB model at the same time it issued a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quest-2-foam-facial-interface-recall-163432642.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">voluntary recall of the Quest 2</a> to address an issue with the original face insert that came with the headset. The company temporarily stopped selling the Quest 2 for about a month so that it could add a new silicone face cover inside the box of each new unit. If you’re a current Quest 2 owner, you can request Facebook send you the new silicone cover by visiting the My Devices section of the account settings. The new 128GB model also comes with the silicone cover inside the box.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[From a high level, all of the recent deal-making in corporate cards and spend management shows that it’s not enough to just help companies track what employees are expensing these days.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, spend management startup Ramp said it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">raised a $300 million Series C</a> that valued it at $3.9 billion. It also said it was acquiring Buyer, a “negotiation-as-a-service” platform that it believes will help customers save money on purchases and SaaS products.</p>
<p>The round and deal were announced just a week after competitor Brex shared news of its own acquisition — the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/brex-buys-weav-a-universal-api-for-commerce-platforms-for-50m/">$50 million purchase</a> of Israeli fintech startup Weav. That deal was made after Brex’s founders invested in Weav, which offers a &#8220;universal API for commerce platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a high level, all of the recent deal-making in corporate cards and spend management shows that it’s not enough to just help companies track what employees are expensing these days. As the market matures and feature sets begin to converge, the players are seeking to differentiate themselves from the competition.</p>
<p>But the point of interest here is these deals can tell us where both companies think they can provide and extract the most value from the market.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			These differences come atop another layer of divergence between the two companies: While Brex has instituted a paid software tier of its service, Ramp has not.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Earning more by spending less</h2>
<p>Let’s start with Ramp.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/"> Launched in 2019</a>, the company is a relative newcomer in the spend management category. But by all accounts, it’s producing some impressive growth numbers. As our colleague Mary Ann Azevedo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the company says it has seen its number of cardholders on its platform increase by 5x, with more than 2,000 businesses currently using Ramp as their “primary spend management solution.” The transaction volume on its corporate cards has tripled since April, when its last raise was announced. And, impressively, Ramp has seen its transaction volume increase year over year by 1,000%, according to CEO and co-founder Eric Glyman.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ramp&#8217;s focus has always been on helping its customers save money: It touts a 1.5% cash back reward for all purchases made through its cards, and says its dashboard helps businesses identify duplicitous subscriptions and license redundancies. Ramp also alerts customers when they can save money on annual versus monthly subscriptions, which it says has led many customers to do away with established T&amp;E platforms like Concur or Expensify.</p>
<p>All told, the company claims that the average customer saves 3.3% per year on expenses after switching to its platform — and all that is before it brings Buyer into the fold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flockjay.com/">Flockjay</a>, a bootcamp startup that helps laid off people and job seekers break into tech, cut half of its own employees amid a broader pivot to a B2B SaaS platform, TechCrunch has learned from sources close to the company.</p>
<p>The layoffs impacted every nontechnical team at Flockjay, including admission advisers, biz ops and development, partnerships, recruiting and marketing professionals. An estimated 30 to 45 people were laid off via an all-hands meeting, which accounts for at least half of Flockjay’s full-time staff. A hiring list of those impacted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6835668009177235456/">has already been highly circulated on LinkedIn.</a></p>
<p>“As a mission-driven organization, we care deeply about our graduates not only landing jobs, but also earning promotions and becoming future leaders of their companies. We learned while growing how important it is to invest early in building scalable support for our alumni, the teams they are on, and all mission-aligned sales organizations to level the playing field,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/shaanh?lang=en">CEO Shaan Hathiramani</a> in a statement to TechCrunch. “That meant making the difficult but necessary decision to run our classes in a more limited capacity while we focus on building that platform. We recognize that this decision has real human consequences, especially considering how talented and tightknit our team is.”</p>
<p>The startup graduated from Y Combinator in 2019 with a simple goal: serve as an onramp for people to break into tech careers. Flockjay’s core offering is a 10-week sales training bootcamp that helps place graduates into sales jobs across tech companies — about 80% of the company’s students find a job within the first six months of graduation,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/backed-by-marc-benioff-flockjay-pitches-its-sales-training-service-as-an-onramp-to-tech-careers/"> the company said in January.</a> The graduates of the course, otherwise known as Flockjay Tech Fellows, make an average of $75,000 upon graduation.</p>
<p>This core offering will continue to function but in a limited capacity for now, according to documents obtained by TechCrunch. It will come at a cost to diverse talent. In a previous interview, Flockjay confirmed that roughly 40% of students don’t have a four-year college degree; half of the students identify as female or nonbinary, and half of the company’s students identify as Black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>As Hathiramani&#8217;s comment alludes to, the company has spent years training students on how to be competitive hires for sales teams, so assumedly, it has key insight on what tech companies need today from an infrastructure and human perspective. A B2B SaaS tool focused on sales operations and efficiency could bring Flockjay more predictable revenue and assumedly less labor-intensive work.</p>

<p>Layoffs could signal changing tides for the broader edtech industry, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/edtechs-next-mission-go-everywhere/">a sector revitalized by the pandemic.</a> While it is true that learners shifted online, there are still questions around what purpose non-accredited training programs, such as Flockjay, serve, one investor said. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/career-karma-series-a/">With so many options in the market,</a> users have optionality on what service they frequent — and the service may indeed be the one that has a flashy university partnership that validates their program and offers a safety net.</p>
<p>Flockjay’s struggles also put a spotlight on the highly scrutinized income-share agreements, ISAs. The financial instrument essentially allows students to avoid paying upfront fees to attend a bootcamp, and then ultimately pay back class fees through a percentage of their future income. While ISAs play a role in making education more accessible in the beginning, satisfying those agreements post-employment can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/lambda-school-lawsuits/">where the controversy begins around liability.</a> Lambda School, a well-known company in the tech bootcamp world, also uses ISAs. The startup announced that it would be doing a broader restructuring earlier this year, while also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">laying off 65 of its employees.</a></p>
<p>Flockjay has raised $11 million in known ventures and capital to date. Since its founding, the startup has attracted investments from Serena Williams, Gabrielle Union and Will Smith, along with institutional investors including Lightspeed, Coatue, Y Combinator, eVentures, Salesforce Ventures, the Impact America Fund and Cleo Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fika.vc/">Fika Ventures</a> is a five-year-old, LA-based seed-stage fund that has been funding mostly business-to-business startups, as well as fintech companies and a sprinkling of healthcare IT startups &#8212; as long as they don&#8217;t involve hardware or FDA approval.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s investors apparently think it&#8217;s doing a decent job. After raising $41 million for its debut fund, followed by a $77 million fund that Fika closed in 2019, the outfit is today announcing a third flagship fund with $160 million to invest, along with an opportunity-type fund with $35 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a major endorsement for such a young firm. Still, even with upwards of 10 promising portfolio companies &#8212; including Formative, a Santa Monica, California-based platform for K-12 teachers to create assessments that raised<a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/formative-a-student-learning-and-analytics-platform-raises-70m-to-challenge-the-summative-test-based-approach-to-education/"> $70 million</a> in June; Pipe, a Miami-based startup that lets companies sell their recurring revenue streams on its platform and raised $250 million at a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">$2 billion valuation</a> in May; and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://papayaglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Papaya Global</a>, an Israeli startup that sells payroll, hiring, onboarding and compliance service and raised <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/papaya-global-raises-100m-more-at-a-1b-valuation-for-tools-to-hire-pay-and-manage-distributed-workforces/">$100 million</a> earlier this year &#8212; it&#8217;s getting harder right now to do what they do, say firm cofounders Eva Ho and TX Zhou. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a crazy time,&#8221; Ho offers.</p>
<p>We had a candid conversation with the pair yesterday, edited lightly for length below.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This is now one of the bigger seed-stage firms in LA. What percentage of your investments are local?</strong></p>
<p>EH: We feel like we have a home court advantage here, so about 40% of our deals are here, then the rest are in markets like Seattle, New York, Boston, Austin, Chicago. We recently did a deal in Toronto because they have a nice AI community there. But we still very much believe in needing boots on the ground, so go after geographies where we can fly to board meetings and be there physically to support [our founders] when they need us.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Your new flagship fund is more than twice the size of your last fund. How will that impact how much you invest?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TZ: Our check sizes will grow a bit in tandem with the market. As you know, seed rounds are now quite a bit larger. I think initial checks will be in the $1 million to $3 million range; with the last fund, we reserved up to $6 million per company and now we&#8217;ll reserve up to $10 million.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Tell us a little about investing in a market where everybody is a founder, and everyone is also an investor. </strong></p>
<p>EH: It&#8217;s definitely a crazy time. It feels like we&#8217;re running a marathon <em>and</em> trying to be in a sprint. We have to have the long view and make bets with that horizon in mind, but at the same time, the decisions for initial and follow-on rounds have gotten just a lot faster.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you continue to make good decisions when things are moving so fast?</strong></p>
<p>EH: The things we&#8217;ve been doing include increasing the size of the team and doing more work upfront on an industry so that we have more prepared minds coming in. But it continues to be a struggle because everything has been sort of compressed.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The early-stage venture capital market is weird and chaotic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/embed/#?secret=c8pnxceLcv" data-secret="c8pnxceLcv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TZ: I think in the past, seed funds could get away with being pure generalists, even within sectors. But we&#8217;ve been forced over the last 12 months to really understand even more sub sectors within each of our verticals. For example, within fintech, we&#8217;ve kind of taken a deep dive in real estate and insurance, and that helps us come into deals [prepared] given how fast they&#8217;re moving these days.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What is the fastest deal you&#8217;ve done?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: In the past, deals that we were looking at were getting done in two to three weeks; now the average time is probably a week to a week-and-a-half to make a final decision. I&#8217;d say the fastest we&#8217;ve moved is in five days, in a situation where we&#8217;ve known the entrepreneur for years so there was strong validation on a personal level. There was also good founder-market fit in terms of what they wanted to do.</p>
<p>EH: We just pull ourselves out of certain rounds that are moving [super fast] and/or valuation expectation upfront is just crazy. You see a lot of pre-seed rounds right now that are pre-product, pre-traction, pre-revenue that are done at $15 million or $20 million or $30 million post-money valuations. We&#8217;ll certainly flex for the right things, but there is just a lot of froth in the market right now.</p>
<p><strong>TC: If the terms are right, are you funding pre-seed, pre-product, pre-traction teams?</strong></p>
<p>EH: To be very frank, we have moved a little earlier in some cases. In the first fund, we [invested about] 15% in pre-seed startups, which to us means very early product and very early traction and sometimes no traction. In fund two, we&#8217;ve invested maybe 25% in pre-seed deals because the really good founders who&#8217;ve been shown that they&#8217;re able to execute and have vision &#8212; they get snapped up quickly, so you have to adapt and evolve a bit and move downstream a little more. That said, I think almost all the companies we fund have some sort of [minimum viable product] and some initial design partners in place, even if they don&#8217;t have any meaningful revenues yet.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What percentage of your investments in your most recent fund have gone to repeat founders?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: I&#8217;d say 15% to 20%. Obviously, we can&#8217;t and don&#8217;t limit ourselves to [serial entrepreneurs], but with repeat founders, deals move even faster than before.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the most absurd thing you&#8217;ve seen in this go-go market?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: I think the most absurd thing we&#8217;ve heard are funds that are making decisions after a 30-minute call with the founder.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you ever pass on a company because you&#8217;re not that excited about the rest of the cap table?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: The speed of deals has forced us to really quickly home in on what we care about. In the past, we had the luxury of having this long laundry list of things we wanted to check off and in a positive way, we&#8217;ve been forced to home in on the three to five things that we really care about for each deal.</p>

<p>The bigger challenge is that investors who decide in 30 minutes create unrealistic expectations by founders. Sometimes they expect everyone to process information that quickly, and I think what they&#8217;re missing is that these funds are not processing the information.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s one way you get founders to slow down and pay attention?</strong></p>
<p>TZ: We actually give every founder that we&#8217;ve come close to making a decision on a complete list of every single founder that we&#8217;ve backed in the past with their contact information.</p>
<p>Initially, we did this to help us win deals, but I think very quickly founders get a sense of what it&#8217;s like to work with us, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly every top investment bank is chasing Byju’s and nudging the most valuable Indian startup to seriously explore the public markets as soon as next year.</p>
<p>Most banks have given Byju’s a proposed valuation in the range of $40 billion to $45 billion, but some including Morgan Stanley have pitched a $50 billion valuation if the startup lists next year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>The startup, which has raised $1.5 billion since the beginning of the pandemic last year, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">most recently valued at $16.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The banks’ excitement comes as the Indian public market has shown a glimpse of strong appetite for consumer tech stocks. Food delivery Zomato had a stellar $1.3 billion debut on Indian stock exchanges last month. Scores of other top startups including Paytm, PolicyBazaar, Nykaa, Ixigo and MobiKwik have also filed paperworks for their IPOs.</p>
<p>Byju Raveendran (pictured above), the founder and chief executive of the eponymous startup, has publicly suggested in the past that he may list the firm in two to three years. According to a senior executive, who wishes to not be named as the matter is private, and an investor, the startup has not set a concrete timeline for an IPO.</p>
<p>In the immediate future, odds of Byju’s raising again is high. The startup has received several inbound requests from investors to raise at a valuation of about $21.5 billion, the people said.</p>
<p>The startup has used a significant portion of its recent fundraises to acquire firms. Earlier this year, it acquired Aakash, one of the largest coaching institutes for high-school students with over 200 centers,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/"> for nearly $1 billion</a>. It has also purchased Great Learning, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/byjus-acquires-reading-platform-epic-for-500-million-in-us-expansion-push/">U.S.-based Epic</a>, among others, for over $1 billion in cash and stock deals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.</p>
<p>The pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools, accelerated its growth, and those of several other online learning startups including Unacademy and Vedantu.</p>
<p>As of early this year, Byju’s said it had amassed over 80 million users, 5.5 million of whom are paying subscribers. Byju’s, which is profitable, is on track to generate revenue of $300 million in the U.S. this year (per Raveendran), and as high as $1.1 billion in revenue overall by the end of the calendar year, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Byju’s declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global startup community is currently enjoying a period of fundraising success that may be unprecedented in the history of technology and venture capital. While this is happening around the world, few startup hubs in the world are reveling in a greater boost to their ability to attract capital than Boston.</p>
<p>The well-known U.S. city is a traditional venture capital hub, but one that seemed to fall behind its domestic rivals Silicon Valley and New York City in recent years. However, data indicates that Boston’s startup activity in fundraising terms has reached a new, higher plateau, funneling record sums into the city’s upstart technology companies this year.</p>
<p>And, according to local investors, there could be room for further acceleration in capital disbursement.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The Exchange wanted to better understand what&#8217;s driving Boston’s rapid-fire results, and discover if there is any particular need for caution or concern. Is the market overheated? According to local investors<a href="https://twitter.com/robgo"> Rob Go</a> from NextView, <a href="https://twitter.com/jamieagoldstein">Jamie Goldstein</a> from Pillar VC, <a href="https://twitter.com/lilylyman">Lily Lyman</a> from Underscore and <a href="https://twitter.com/sanjivkalevar">Sanjiv Kalevar</a> from OpenView, things may be more than warm, but Boston’s accelerating venture capital totals in 2021 are not based on FOMO or other potentially ephemeral trends.</p>
<p>Instead, Boston is benefiting from larger structural changes to at least the U.S. venture capital market, helping close historical gaps in its startup funding market and access funds that previously might have skipped the region. And local university density isn’t hurting the city’s cause, either, boosting its ability to form new companies during a period of rich investment access.</p>
<p>Let’s talk data, and then hear from the investing crew about just what is going on over in Beantown.</p>
<h2>A record year in the making</h2>
<p>When discussing venture capital data, we often note that it is somewhat laggy, with rounds announced long after they are closed. In practice, this means that more recent data can undersell how a particular quarter has performed. With Boston’s 2021 thus far, all that we can say is that if this data includes normal venture capital lag, it will simply be all the more incredible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ispace, a Japanese space startup that aims to lead the development of a lunar economy, has unveiled its design for a large lander that could go to the moon as early as 2024.</p>
<p>Tokyo-based ispace said this next-gen lander, dubbed Series 2, would be used on the company’s third planned moon mission. The lander is both larger in size and payload capacity than the company’s first lander, coming in at around 9 feet tall and 14 feet wide including legs. The vehicle will be capable of carrying up to 500 kilograms to the moon’s surface and 2,000 kilograms to lunar orbit. Series 1, which will fly in 2022 and 2023, has a maximum payload capacity of only 30 kilograms.</p>
<p>Crucially, the new lander is designed to be able to survive the frigid lunar nighttime, possibly as long as a two-week stint on the moon’s surface. It’s also capable of landing on either the near or far side of the moon, including its polar regions.</p>
<p>The new lander has a few other features as well: It has multiple payload bays, and an advanced guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system to ensure the craft sticks the landing on the moon&#8217;s surface. The GNC technology is being provided by engineering developer Draper, a company with a deep footprint in the space industry. Draper is also one of 14 eligible contractors for NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.</p>
<p>Ispace said in a statement that the lander has completed its preliminary design review; the next stage is manufacturing and assembly, which will be completed in partnership with General Atomics, a defense and aerospace technology company.</p>
<p>The partnership with Draper — a CLPS contractor — is key, as ispace wants its Series 2 to compete in the NASA program. “Over the next few months, we will work closely with Draper and General Atomics to prepare for the next NASA CLPS task order,” Kyle Acierno, CEO of ispace’s U.S.-based subsidiary, said.</p>
<p>Ispace is developing the next-gen lander out of its North American offices in Colorado, and it intends to also manufacture the vehicle in the United States. In the meanwhile, the company is still at work preparing for its first two lunar missions in 2022 and 2023. The company said the Series 1 lander is undergoing final assembly of the flight module at a facility in Germany owned by space launch company ArianeGroup. The customer manifest for the first mission is full, but ispace did say payload capacity is still available for the subsequent mission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The lander unveiling comes just weeks after ispace announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/japanese-startup-ispace-raises-46m-to-support-planned-moon-missions/">the close</a> of a $46 million Series C funding round, capital it said at the time would go toward the second and third planned missions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re less than one month away from kicking off our flagship global event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>. And we’re feeling the adrenaline rush that can only come when more than 10,000 startup icons, experts, founders, investors and makers gather to learn, inspire, connect, collaborate, compete and network.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?display=true">Buy your pass here</a> and brace yourself for three full days of Disrupt.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at just some of the opportunities that can help you move the needle on your startup aspirations.</p>
<p>You’ll find plenty of startup action on two distinct stages. First up, the Disrupt main stage featuring in-depth interviews and panel discussions with a who’s-who of tech, policy and celebrity-slash-entrepreneurial talent — like Calendly CEO Tope Awotona, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and movie-star-turned-pot-businessman Seth Rogen.</p>
<p>The Extra Crunch stage is where you’ll find a deep bench of subject-matter experts sharing practical how-to content. You’ll take away actionable insights you can put into practice now — when you need it most. We’re talking essential topics like <strong>How to Raise Your First Dollars</strong> and <strong>The Subtle Challenges of Assessing Product-Market Fit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip of the tech iceberg:</strong> Check out the full <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Disrupt 2021 agenda</a> and don’t forget — your pass includes video-on-demand. You can relax knowing you won’t miss a single presentation.</p>
<p>Don’t miss the hundreds of innovative startups strutting their considerable stuff in Startup Alley, the virtual expo area. Dive into an ocean of opportunity — ask for a product demo, schedule a 1:1 video meeting or explore potential ways to collaborate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Networking is a huge part of Disrupt, and you’ll find multiple ways to make valuable connections. Whether they happen spontaneously in our virtual event platform (the chat is where it’s at!) or curated meetups through CrunchMatch, our AI-powered platform, you’ll meet smart, exciting people eager to make a business connection. Who knows where a simple conversation can lead?</p>
<p>Don’t miss Startup Battlefield — the epic pitch competition that launched big-name companies like Dropbox, Mint, TripIt, Vurb and many more. Top early-stage startups from around the world — from any country and industry — will compete for a shot at $100,000 in equity-free prize money. You might just catch the next unicorn in its pony stage. It’s more than thrilling — as noted by Jessica McLean, director of Marketing and Communications, Infinite-Compute:</p>
<blockquote><p>Watching the Startup Battlefield was fantastic. You could see the ingenuity and innovation happening in different technology spaces. Just looking at the sheer number of other pitch decks and hearing the judges tear them down and give feedback was very helpful.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.paxos.com">Paxos</a>, the company behind the Paxos Standard stablecoin (PAX), has <a href="https://www.paxos.com/the-digital-dollar-that-always-equals-a-dollar-paxos-standard-pax-is-now-pax-dollar-usdp/">announced</a> that it is changing the name of its crypto asset. Paxos Standard is now Pax Dollar, and you’ll soon be able to identify it on your favorite cryptocurrency exchange, wallet or explorer under the USDP ticker.</p>
<p>Other than the name, USDP remains fundamentally identical to PAX. Like other stablecoins, USDP has been invented so that its value doesn’t fluctuate over time when you compare it to fiat currencies. The value of USDP is indexed to USD. At any point in time, one USDP is worth one USD.</p>
<p>Stablecoins provide many advantages. Sending money is as easy as moving crypto assets from one wallet to another. You don’t have to enter intermediary bank information, worry about local regulation, etc. Many people around the world don’t have bank accounts — stablecoins and cryptocurrency wallets could potentially become an alternative to traditional bank accounts.</p>
<p>You can also use stablecoins to take advantage of DeFi projects (decentralized finance). For instance, you can contribute to lending pools and earn interest from your stablecoin holdings.</p>
<p>In addition to USDP, other popular stablecoins include USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT). As you can see, a naming convention has emerged over time. And Paxos says that it is changing the name of its stablecoin for this reason in particular.</p>
<p>Whenever Paxos issues new tokens, it stores some USD and USD equivalent in a bank account. Right now, Paxos <a href="https://www.paxos.com/a-regulated-stablecoin-means-having-a-regulator/">uses</a> US Treasury Bills with short maturities as USD equivalent. Auditing firms regularly check the company’s claims.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paxos tries to position itself as a company that is deeply committed to regulation. It has recently written <a href="https://www.paxos.com/a-regulated-stablecoin-means-having-a-regulator/">a report</a> highlighting the differences between USDP, USDC and USDT. According to the company, USDC and USDT shouldn’t be considered as regulated assets because of their reserves. Paxos wants to emerge as the most legitimate player in the space so that big corporate clients choose Paxos as their preferred partner.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Circle announced that USDC would <a href="https://www.centre.io/blog/usdc-reserves-composition">switch</a> to cash and cash equivalent for USDC reserves. I’m sure we’ll hear more from cryptocurrency companies and their stablecoin reserve strategies in the future.</p>
