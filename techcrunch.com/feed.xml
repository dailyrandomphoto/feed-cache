										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The New York Times is bringing its signature crosswords game into augmented reality. The media company announced this morning it&#8217;s launching a new AR-enabled game, &#8220;Shattered Crosswords,&#8221; on Instagram, where players will be able to solve clues by finding spinning broken crossword pieces in AR. When the right vantage point is achieved, players will find the words hidden among the shards above the puzzle.</p>
<p>The concept is similar to those found in other 3D puzzlers, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polysphere-art-of-puzzle/id1440756080">Polysphere</a>, for example, where you swipe to rotate broken pieces to see a complete picture. But in this case, The NYT has made the whole gaming experience appear in augmented reality, as well.</p>
<p>The new game was built using technology from Facebook&#8217;s Spark AR platform, the company says, and it&#8217;s the first time The NYT has created an AR gaming experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, it&#8217;s not the first time The NYT has worked with AR technology.</p>
<p>This fall, The New York Times announced a multi-year collaboration with Facebook <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/new-york-times-ar-instagram/">focused</a> on publishing a series of AR-driven reporting on Instagram. The reports would use AR technology to tell stories in a more visual and interactive way. To support its new efforts, The NYT also launched its own AR Lab with a staff of over a dozen employees who would work alongside a dedicated newsroom team to develop the AR journalism content.</p>
<p>To date, the Lab has helped produce visual stories tied to the centennial of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/17/us/suffrage-movement-photos-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/17/us/suffrage-movement-photos-history.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608733935800000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHriROPXwreUcHie67c2UGa2jUgWg">women’s suffrage</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/science/wear-mask-covid-particles-ul.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/science/wear-mask-covid-particles-ul.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608733935800000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGaOmbQb2AQih18whxdN2TfnIplww">the science behind the effectiveness of face masks</a> and coverage of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/california-wildfires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/california-wildfires&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608733935800000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGK5mHFPUXrp_LPnasYIJYsr9Ut2w">California wildfires.</a></p>
<p>The NYT had begun to experiment with AR in previous years, too, though not in partnership with Facebook. In 2018, for example, it announced it would begin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/01/sports/olympics/nyt-ar-augmented-reality-guide.html">using augmented reality to tell stories</a> within its own native app for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Before today, The NYT did feature &#8220;live solves&#8221; of its Crossword on social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, as a way to engage players on social media. But these were not standalone games or built with AR &#8212; they were <a href="https://twitter.com/NYTimesWordplay/status/1245758478544601088">viewing experiences</a>.</p>
<p>That said, the new game itself may have limited appeal, beyond being an interesting demo of AR from The NYT. The puzzle is too small and simple to appeal to any serious crossword fans, and the process of finding clues in the shards requires gestures and movement, which can get frustrating after some time. It doesn&#8217;t move as smoothly as something like Polysphere, either, we found.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear who would return to this sort of puzzle on a regular basis, compared with traditional mobile games or even the standard crossword puzzle.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Shattered Crosswords&#8221; game is available on the @NYTimes Instagram profile page under the &#8220;Effects&#8221; tab, alongside the company&#8217;s other AR reports. It works on both iOS and Android platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.stepzen.com/">StepZen</a>, a new startup from the crew who gave you <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apigee/api-management">Apigee</a> (which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/08/google-will-acquire-apigee-for-625-million/">sold to Google</a> in 2016 for $625 million) had a different vision for their latest company. They are building a single API that pulls data from disparate sources to help developers deliver more complex customer experiences online.</p>
<p>Today, the startup emerged from stealth and announced an $8 million seed investment from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/neotribe-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="neotribe-ventures">Neotribe Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wing-venture-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wing-venture-capital">Wing Venture Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>With years of experience working with APIs, the founders wanted to take that a step further says CEO and co-founder Anant Jhingran. &#8220;StepZen is a product that lets front end developers easily create and consume one API for all the data they need from the back end,&#8221; he explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is all in the service of providing a smoother, more consistent customer experience. That means whether you are on an eCommerce site accessing your order history or a banking app grabbing your current balance, these scenarios require pulling data from various back end data resources. Connecting to those resources is a time-consuming task and StepZen wants to simplify that for developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developers spend an enormous amount of time deploying and managing code that accesses the back end, and what StepZen wants to do is to give them that time back,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xoC2WaPJzg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/jitsu-nabs-2m-seed-to-build-open-source-data-integration-platform/">Jitsu nabs $2M seed to build open-source data integration platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jitsu nabs $2M seed to build open-source data integration platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/jitsu-nabs-2m-seed-to-build-open-source-data-integration-platform/embed/#?secret=xoC2WaPJzg" data-secret="xoC2WaPJzg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Instead of manually writing code to pull this data, StepZen enables developers to simply provide configuration information and credentials to connect to these back end data sources, and then it builds a single API that handles all of the heavy lifting of pulling that data and presenting it when needed.</p>
<p>Jhingran uses the example of presenting a list of open orders for a customer. It sounds simple enough, but once you consider that the data could live in several places including the CRM system, the order system or with your courier, that means accessing at least three separate and highly disparate systems. StepZen will help pull this all together via its API and present it smoothly to the user.</p>
<p>Today the company has 11 employees including the three founders with plans to add another 8 or so in 2021. As they do that, CBO and co-founder Helen Whelan says that they are working to build a diverse and inclusive company. While the founding team is itself diverse, they want to hire employees with diverse backgrounds and ways of thinking to build the most complete product and company.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first 10 or so employees, we tapped into the networks of the people who&#8217;ve worked with, people who you know can do a great job. Then I think it&#8217;s about deliberately expanding from there and deliberately taking the time that you need to explore and expand your pipeline of candidates,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company is just 9 months old and has been spending most of this year building the solution and working with pre-alpha users. Today the product is in alpha with plans to release it as a software service early next year.</p>
<p>As the company emerges from stealth, it&#8217;s looking to continue building the product and looking for ways to remove as much complexity as possible. &#8220;We know how to do the hard things on the back end. We&#8217;ve got the database technologies and the API technologies down, and it&#8217;s now about finding how to make all of that simple on the outside and easy for developers to use, &#8221; Whelan said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2016, when the world felt like an entirely different place, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/speakable-lets-you-take-action-on-news-articles-that-move-you/">Jordan Hewson launched a platform called Speakable</a>. It was meant to let news readers take action on a cause or issue in the very moment they cared most: while reading a news article about it. The company partnered with publishers and NGOs to deliver an action button, right on the publisher&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>Skip forward to today, and people have become far more proactive about the causes they care about. That&#8217;s why Hewson is launching a new product called <a href="https://actionable.org/">actionable</a>, a library of actions mapped across dozens of causes, giving the user a clear view into how they can do something about the things they care about most.</p>
<p>Though donations are an option across the platform, there are other methods by which users can take action, including volunteering, contacting your representatives, and signing petitions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We were founded before the 2016 election,&#8221; said Hewson. &#8220;And Speakable was based on the hypothesis that if we didn&#8217;t make action easy, people wouldn&#8217;t do it. But so much has changed, politically and socially, that people are really breaking down the doors to find out ways that they can help in this moment that we&#8217;re in. So we really wanted to be able to provide our users with a platform where they can proactively seek out things that they want to do and deepen their community experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Issues on the platform include Education, Equal Rights, Environment, Health, Migration, Politics, Poverty, Racial Justice and more. When a user clicks on an issue, actionable breaks the results down into the type of action the user might take, from donating to volunteering to signing petitions. The platform also drills down into the specific mission of the organization to give users a clear look at how they&#8217;re spending their resources.</p>
<p>When Speakable launched, it offered its services for free in the hopes of scaling up rapidly. Today, the platform charges a 3 percent service fee for donations made through the platform, but Hewson doesn&#8217;t see that as the company&#8217;s primary revenue generator.</p>
<p>Rather, Speakable is partnering with brands to sponsor action buttons for their own purpose-based initiatives. Hewson explains that might take the form of a matching campaign or sponsoring the ability for you to reach out to your legislator on a certain issue, giving the publishers another way to generate revenue, as well as Speakable, while scaling campaigns and initiatives on behalf of the brand partners.</p>
<p>The company is currently partnered with about 90 publishers and, via an API, aims to list all the non-profits that exist in the States.</p>
<p>Interestingly, actionable doesn&#8217;t necessarily rank or curate the NGOs on its platform in an effort to maintain neutrality among non-profits, according to Hewson.</p>
<p>Speakable has raised $2.5 million since inception. It has also powered 10 million actions, with the majority of those actions coming in 2020, with 5.2 million actions taken this year. Just this past week, in fact, Speakable facilitated more than $1.3 million in donations in a single day to Feeding America in partnership with the TODAY show.</p>
<p>The team is about 15 people. Sixty percent identify as women at the female-founded company, with 20 percent identifying as BIPOC and 10 percent identifying as LGBTQI+.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vergesense" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vergesense">VergeSense, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a startup that uses machine vision to help businesses better understand how their office spaces are being utilized, today announced that it has raised a $12 million Series B funding round led by Tola Capital.</p>
<p>Including the company&#8217;s $9 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/vergesense-grabs-9m-for-its-people-counting-sensor-tech-as-offices-eye-covid-changes/">Series A round</a>, which it raised earlier this year, VergeSense has now raised a total of $22.6 million. Previous investors include JLL Spark, Allegion Ventures, MetaProp, Y Combinator, Pathbreaker Ventures and West Ventures.</p>
<p>Given the COVID-19 pandemic, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that VergeSense would be seeing quite a bit of demand for its service and sensors. While the company was seeing strong growth since its launch in 2017, the pandemic is accelerating the move to smarter office spaces. As VergeSense CEO and co-founder Dan Ryan told me, over the course of the last few months, the company added new features to help businesses manage social distancing, for example, and to better understand where in a given office they should intensify their cleaning protocols.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2090014" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Sensor.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090014" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2090014" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Sensor.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Sensor.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Sensor.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Sensor.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Sensor.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Sensor.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Sensor.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VergeSense-Sensor.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2090014" class="wp-caption-text">VergeSense sensor</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also becoming increasingly clear that even after we get the pandemic under control, office spaces &#8212; and office work &#8212; will look radically different. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a sort of a hybrid model of working, which, pre-pandemic, was already something that was happening &#8212; companies were experimenting with this &#8212; but now it&#8217;s been turbocharged,&#8221; Ryan said. &#8220;We never anticipated any of this, but I think it&#8217;s a great example of the possibilities that you can help support when you have this intelligent infrastructure all around you that allows you to almost program the physical world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another new feature the company launched this year allows its tools to register when a seat is likely occupied, even though nobody is in it right now, by looking for backpacks and other signs that would signal that a desk is in use.</p>
<p>VergeSense currently has customers in 29 countries.

<p>As Ryan told me, the company saw quite a bit of inbound interest from investors this year and the team wanted to capitalize on the current trends. &#8220;As we look forward to &#8217;21, especially now that this transition to an agile hybrid seating model is going to be turbocharged, we were preparing for and planning for additional growth there as well. So this was sort of opportunistic opportunity to team up with Tola to help go to the next level,&#8221; Ryan explained.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to continue to work on its core computer vision capabilities and hardware, but as Ryan noted, one of the focus areas for VergeSense in 2021 will also include new partnerships and integrations with tools for booking desks and rooms, as well as building automation systems. To do so, it plans to double its headcount and hire across all departments.</p>
<p>VergeSense is obviously not the only company playing in this space. Swiss startup <a href="https://locatee.com/en/">Locatee</a>, for example, raised a Series A round for its service earlier this year, though it uses network data to measure occupancy and not the kind of dedicated sensors that VergeSense is developing. Other players include the likes of <a href="https://www.density.io/">Density</a>, <a href="https://basking.io/">Basking</a> and <a href="https://www.steerpath.com/occupancy-analytics">SteerPath</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astroscale" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astroscale">Astroscale <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has shipped its ELSA-d spacecraft to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazahkstan, where it will be integrated with a Soyuz rocket for a launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/astroscale-sets-march-2021-for-first-commercial-orbital-debris-removal-demonstration/">scheduled for March of next year</a>. This is a crucial mission for Astroscale, since it&#8217;ll be the first in-space demonstration of the company&#8217;s technology for de-orbiting space debris, a cornerstone of its proposed space sustainability service business.</p>
<p>The ELSA-d mission by Astroscale is a small satellite mission that will demonstrate two key technologies that enable the company&#8217;s vision for orbital debris removal. First will be a targeting component, demonstrating an ability to locate and dock with a piece of space debris, using positioning sensors including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gps-3a87" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gps-3a87">GPS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and laser locating technologies. That will be used by a so-called &#8216;servicer&#8217; satellite to find and attach to a &#8216;target&#8217; satellite launched at the same time, which will stand in for a potential piece of debris.</p>
<p>Astroscale intends to dock and release with the &#8216;target&#8217; using its &#8216;servicer&#8217; multiple times over the course of the mission, showing that it can identify and capture uncontrolled objects in space, and that it can maneuver them for controlled de-orbit. This will basically prove out the feasibility of the technology underlying its business model, and set it up for future commercial operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In October, Astroscale announced that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/astroscale-raises-51-million-in-series-e-funding-to-fuel-its-orbital-sustainability-ambitions/">had raised $51 million</a>, making its total raised to date $191 million. The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/astroscale-expands-into-geostationary-satellite-life-extension-with-new-acquisition/">acquired the staff and IP of a company called Effective Space Solutions in June</a>, which it will use to build out the geostationary servicing arm of its business, in addition to the LEO operations that ELSA-d will demonstrate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.liberis.com/">Liberis</a>, the U.K.-based fintech that provides finance for small businesses as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/liberis/">an alternative to a traditional bank loan or extended overdraft</a>, has replenished its own coffers with £70 million in funding. The round is a mixture of debt and venture debt, although the company is declining to disclose the percentage split, so we can likely chalk this up as mostly debt to fund the loans Liberis issues.</p>
<p>Providing the financing are previous backers British Business Investments, Paragon Bank and BCI Europe, along with new partner <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/silicon-valley-bank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="silicon-valley-bank">Silicon Valley Bank <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (SVB). It brings the total funding raised by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/liberis" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="liberis">Liberis <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to £200 million, including more than £50 million in equity funding. “The new funds will be used to fuel company growth, launch new products and markets, and provide additional customer financing solutions,” says the fintech.</p>
<p>To date, 2007-founded Liberis has provided over £500 million in financing to 16,000 SMEs across Europe, the U.S. and the U.K. (the product is available in five new countries: U.S., Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic and Slovakia). However, lending has really picked up lately, with £250 million lent in the past two years alone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Liberis provides SMEs with funding from £1,000 to £300,000 based on projected credit and debit card sales. However, the clever part is that the loan is paid back via a pre-agreed percentage of the business’ digital transactions. In other words, bar any minimum monthly payment agreed, the repayment schedule is directly tied to the size and pace of a business’ card transactions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2YytgNNFrn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/liberis/">Liberis raises £57.5M to offer finance for small businesses paid back via customer card transactions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Liberis raises £57.5M to offer finance for small businesses paid back via customer card transactions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/liberis/embed/#?secret=2YytgNNFrn" data-secret="2YytgNNFrn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Noteworthy, the go-to-market strategy has shifted toward B2B2B &#8212; or “embedded finance” &#8212; with Liberis now predominantly partnering with marketplaces, software providers and acquirers, such as Worldpay from FIS and Global Payments. These partners integrate with Liberis to offer personalised pre-approved revenue-based financing to their end customers.</p>
<p>“Liberis’ core business is to enable partners to offer embedded business finance to their customers,” Rob Straathof, CEO of Liberis, tells TechCrunch. “Back in 2015, we launched one of the world’s first embedded business finance partnerships with Worldpay from FIS, and have significantly expanded our partnerships across the globe over the past years, including Global Payments, Opayo (Sagepay), EPOS Now and Worldpay U.S.”</p>
<p>Straathof says that by integrating Liberis’ business finance platform into a partner’s existing ecosystem and customer experience, the fintech is able to provide “instant value” for its partners and the SMEs they support.</p>
<p>“Through our single API integration, we receive privileged data from our partners which enables Liberis to offer hyper-personalised and pre-approved finance to SMEs,” he explains. “By making finance more personalised, intuitive and accessible for SMEs, we in turn empower our partners to unlock greater customer value by improving engagement, satisfaction and loyalty which lowers churn. Ultimately, everyone wins”.</p>
<p>Comments Folake Shasanya, SVB’s head of EMEA warehouse financing: “We are pleased to become a new funding partner to Liberis and have been impressed with their ability to embed financing solutions across technology platforms, payments providers and more. At SVB, supporting innovation is in our DNA and we are delighted to provide this global growth opportunity to Liberis through our warehouse and venture debt products”.</p>
<p><em>Article updated to clarify the round is a mixture of debt and venture debt, without any pure equity funding.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Macau, the former Portuguese colony that is now the world&#8217;s biggest gambling center, is planning to host a tech fair next year to match the famed <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The brains behind the &#8220;Beyond&#8221; conference are Lu Gang, founder of Chinese tech news media company TechNode, which was TechCrunch&#8217;s former China partner, and Jason Ho, a Macanese venture investor and a member of the CPPCC Beijing, China&#8217;s top political advisory body, who also enjoys deep connections in the Macau government.</p>
<p>The event, which is partially funded by the Macau government, signals the region&#8217;s long game to diversify its casino-focused economy for its population of 600,000. The fair has also won &#8220;support&#8221; from the Guangdong provincial government, which is pitching its own &#8220;Greater Bay Area&#8221; comprising Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Macau and other cities in the region, to rival the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Macau has very good infrastructure. With the entertainment industry and the hotels, I think it&#8217;s very suitable for doing an event that could potentially attract people to join,&#8221; Ho told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Unlike CES, the tech fair will have a focus beyond consumer and enterprise electronics to include government-facing technology, Ho said. It&#8217;s inviting companies across the globe that specialize in social and environmental technology, life sciences, advanced technology, and &#8220;new infrastructure,&#8221; a Chinese buzzword referring to innovation in the likes of 5G, smart cities and transportation.</p>
<p>Ho envisions the event will be a bridge between China and the rest of the world, given Macau&#8217;s &#8220;neutral&#8221; position in the geopolitical landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Macau can be a platform that could help other countries to get into Mainland China or even for Mainland China companies to go to APAC or Middle Eastern countries,&#8221; Ho said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Hong Kong and Macau are the only ones that could host a very international and neutral event that people would like to join and won&#8217;t feel like that&#8217;s a very government event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many argue that Hong Kong&#8217;s special status as a semiautonomous region <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/business/hong-kong-special-status-explained.html">is at stake</a> as Beijing tightens its grip over the former British colony. Rise, a popular tech conference that Web Summit hosted in Hong Kong <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/rise-conference-2020-2021/">up until 2019</a>, has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/web-summit-will-hold-rise-2022-in-kuala-lumpur-launch-a-new-event-in-tokyo/">relocated to Kuala Lumpur</a> due to ongoing political tensions in the city.</p>
<p>Ho admitted Macau will potentially face the same challenge, but he believed the exit of major international tech fairs, from Rise in Hong Kong to CES Asia in Shanghai (<a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3093108/ces-asia-chinese-version-major-us-tech-show-gets-scrapped-amid-trade">in part due to the U.S.-China trade war</a>), should open up opportunities for Macau to attract attendees from Asia&#8217;s tech community and others with an interest in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always have a big dream that we want to compare ourselves eventually with Singapore,&#8221; Ho said, adding that the Macau government is working to introduce policies that are friendly to overseas businesses.</p>
<p>Beyond is scheduled to take place in mid-June next year, but the viability of the event will no doubt be contingent on the development of COVID-19 control in the next few months.</p>
<p>Aside from tech corporations and startups, Beyond also looks to attract influential members from academia, society, and provincial governments across China. The event organizer is in talks with ByteDance, DJI, SenseTime, Alibaba, Tencent, Foxconn, BMW and more to invite executives from the giants to attend.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Google said on Tuesday it is investing in two Indian startups, Glance and DailyHunt, as the Android-maker makes further push in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. Two-year-old Indian startup Glance, which serves news, media content, and games on the lock screen of over 100 million smartphones, has raised $145 million in a new financing [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said on Tuesday it is investing in two Indian startups, Glance and DailyHunt, as the Android-maker makes further push in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Two-year-old Indian startup Glance, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/inmobis-glance-tops-100-million-daily-active-users-in-21-months/">serves news, media content, and games on the lock screen of over 100 million smartphones</a>, has raised $145 million in a new financing round from Google and existing investor Mithril Partners.</p>
<p>Glance, which is part of advertising giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/inmobi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="inmobi">InMobi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Group, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">uses AI to offer personalized experience to its users. The service replaces the otherwise empty lock screen with locally relevant news, stories, and casual games. Late last year, InMobi acquired Roposo, a Gurgaon-headquartered startup, that has enabled it to introduce short-form videos on the platform. Google is also investing in Roposo. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roposo is a short video platform with over 33 million monthly active users. These users spend about 20 minutes consuming content across multiple genres in more than 10 languages on the app everyday. </span></p>
<p>Glance ships pre-installed on several smartphone models. The subsidiary maintains tie-ups with nearly every top <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> smartphone vendor including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/xiaomi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="xiaomi">Xiaomi </a>and Samsung, the two largest smartphone vendors in India. The service has amassed over 115 million daily active users.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Glance is a great example of innovation solving for mobile-first and mobile-only consumption, serving content across many of India’s local languages,” said Caesar Sengupta, VP, Google, in a statement. “Still too many Indians have trouble finding content to read or services they can use confidently, in their own language. And this significantly limits the value of the internet for them, particularly at a time like this when the internet is the lifeline of so many people. This investment underlines our strong belief in working with India’s innovative startups and work towards the shared goal of building a truly inclusive digital economy that will benefit everyone.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naveen Tewari, founder and chief executive of Glance and InMobi Group, said the investment will pave the way for &#8220;deeper partnership between Google and Glance across product development, infrastructure, and global market expansion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand in the U.S.</span></p>
<h2>Investment in DailyHunt</h2>
<p>Google said on Tuesday that it is also investing in VerSe Innovation, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/06/newshunt/">parent firm of Indian startup DailyHunt</a>. Across its apps including eponymous service and short-video platform Josh, DailyHunt claims to serve over 300 million users news and entertainment content in 14 Indian languages. The startup said it has completed a round of over $100 million from Google, Microsoft, and AlphaWave among other investors and this new round values it at over $1 billion, making it a unicorn.</p>
<p>DailyHunt &#8212; which is co-run by Umang Bedi, former Facebook India head &#8212; plans to deploy the fresh capital to scale Josh app, the augmentation of local language content offerings, the development of content creator ecosystem, innovation in AI and ML and the growth of its truly &#8220;made-in-Bharat-for-Bharat short-video platform,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Josh and Roposo are among over a dozen apps in India that are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/tiktoks-rivals-in-india-struggle-to-cash-in-on-its-ban/">attempting to fill the void</a> New Delhi created after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banning TikTok in late June</a> in the country. TikTok identified India as its biggest overseas market prior to the ban.</p>
<p>Google is writing both these checks from India Digitization Fund that it unveiled this year. Google has committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">invest $10 billion in India</a> over the course of next few years. Prior to today, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/india-approves-googles-4-5-billion-deal-with-reliances-jio-platforms/">invested $4.5 billion from this fund in Indian telecom giant Jio Platforms</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In their rush to offer alternatives to advanced western chipsets, Chinese semiconductor companies are racking up large fundings from investors. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/horizon-robotics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="horizon-robotics">Horizon Robotics, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a five-year-old unicorn specializing in AI chips for robots and autonomous vehicles, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hxLwKCI6WkA5ntKlvTSH7Q">announced</a> Tuesday that it has secured $150 million in funding.</p>
<p>The proceeds are the first close of an over $700 million Series C round that Horizon is seeking to raise. The partial funding is jointly led by prominent investors 5Y Capital (formerly Morningside Venture Capital), Hillhouse Capital, and Capital Today. <a href="https://www.gtja.com.hk/en/aboutus/#group_profile">Chinese brokerage Guotai Junan&#8217;s international arm</a> and KTB Network, an investment entity under the Korean conglomerate KTB.</p>
<p>The round arrived less than two years after Horizon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/horizon-robotics-raises-600m/">completed its $600 million Series B round</a>, which valued the firm at $3 billion post-money and also saw the participation of prominent Korean financiers including SK China, the China subsidiary of conglomerate SK Group, and SK Hynix, SK’s semiconductor unit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, founded by a Baidu veteran, raised its Series A round of over $100 million led by Intel Capital in late 2017.</p>

<p>With the fresh capital, Horizon plans to hasten the development and commercialization of its automotive chips and autonomous driving solutions. It also aims to build an &#8220;open ecosystem&#8221; for industry partners.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, China has been striving to wean dependence on western chip giants in sectors ranging from smartphones to vehicles. Local startups like Horizon Robotics and Black Sesame Technologies, as well as telecoms titan Huawei, are pouring resources into autonomous driving processors, hoping to match or overtake the technologies from Nvidia and Intel&#8217;s Mobileye.</p>
<p>Horizon&#8217;s OEM and Tier 1 auto partners, according to the firm, include <a href="https://medium.com/horizon-robotics/horizon-robotics-assisted-audi-to-receive-its-first-test-license-for-autonomous-driving-on-public-18dc38f78e5e">Audi</a>, Bosch, <a href="https://medium.com/horizon-robotics/horizon-robotics-and-continental-sign-mou-in-the-field-of-intelligent-driving-839ce85ee486?source=collection_category---4------0-----------------------">Continental</a>, SAIC Motor and BYD.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.casaverdecapital.com/">Casa Verde Capital</a>, the investment fund co-founded by cannabis connoisseur Snoop Dogg (also known as Calvin Broadus), has closed on $100 million for its second investment fund,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1793392/000179339220000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml"> according to documents</a> filed<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1794686/000179468620000001/0001794686-20-000001-index.htm"> with the SEC</a>.</p>
<p>The fund, whose managing director, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/karan-wadhera" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="karan-wadhera">Karan Wadhera <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> declined to comment for this article, has managed to raise more cash just as the market for cannabis-related products seems poised for another period of expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to the public perception of the cannabis industry is not too dissimilar to the dotcom bubble of the late ’90s, where there was a lot of hype — a lot of it driven by public companies — and a lot of speculative trading and valuations that weren’t really founded in reality. [We’re talking about] projections multiple years out into the future, and then crazy revenue multiples on top of that,&#8221; Wadhera <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/cannabis-vc-karan-wadhera-on-why-the-industry-which-took-a-hit-last-year-is-now-quietly-blazing/">said of the last bust when he spoke to TechCrunch in July</a>. &#8220;Things just got really frothy, and that eventually burst, and last April or May was sort of the apex of that moment. It’s when things started to trade off. And it’s been those names, the public names in particular, that have been hit particularly hard.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since then, the industry has come roaring back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sitting here today, four-plus months into COVID, cannabis has really proved itself to be a non-cyclical industry. Cannabis has been deemed an essential business everywhere across the U.S. We had record sales in March, April and May, and the trend has continued,&#8221; Wadhera said in July. &#8220;And now that we are getting into an environment where governments are going to be looking for additional sources of tax revenue, the potential urgency around cannabis legalization is going to be there, which is going to be massively positive for the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no indication of the target for the new venture capital fund, but with the new fundraising, Casa Verde <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/13/snoop-doggs-venture-firm-just-closed-its-debut-fund-with-45-million/">more than doubles the size of its initial investment vehicle</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cannabis VC Karan Wadhera on why the industry, which took a hit last year, is now quietly blazing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/cannabis-vc-karan-wadhera-on-why-the-industry-which-took-a-hit-last-year-is-now-quietly-blazing/embed/#?secret=lpZzYw7etf" data-secret="lpZzYw7etf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since Broadus, Wadhera and a third partner and the founder of Cashmere Agency and Stampede Management <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ted-chung" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ted-chung">Ted Chung launched <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> their debut fund in 2018, weed businesses have endured a roller-coaster business cycle of boom and bust.</p>
<p>In spite of those market vagaries, Casa Verde has managed to build a portfolio that is now worth at least $200 million, according to people with knowledge of the firm. That money has come through several special purpose vehicles and other fundraising mechanisms raised alongside the flagship fund.</p>
<p>The overall market for cannabis and cannabinoid derivatives is expected to hit $34 billion by 2025 according to an analyst report seen by TechCrunch from the investment bank <a href="https://www.cowen.com/">Cowen.</a></p>
<p>With <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arizona" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arizona">Arizona, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota all passing adult-use cannabis legalization measures in their states, the investment bank predicted roughly 30 percent growth to their total addressable market estimates.</p>
<p>For its part, Casa Verde has always taken a broad view on the potential addressable market that cannabis and its chemical compounds could capture.</p>
<p>Nowhere is that more on view than in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/snoop-doggs-casa-verde-gets-into-the-sleep-space-backing-ny-based-proper/">firm&#8217;s latest investment in the sleep company, Proper</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Casa Verde gets into the sleep space, backing NY-based Proper&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/snoop-doggs-casa-verde-gets-into-the-sleep-space-backing-ny-based-proper/embed/#?secret=trGpcMREtB" data-secret="trGpcMREtB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[Cannabis] is an input as well and its use case will go beyond how people think of cannabis stigmatically,” Wadhera said. “At its core, [<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/proper-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="proper-2">Proper] <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is a company that’s helping us target this sleep epidemic. We think CBD and cannabis at large can play a big role in addressing that in a way that traditional products haven’t been able to.”</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s true for sleep is true for a number of other different applications as well, Wadhera has said in the past.</p>
<p>Casa Verde has already invested heavily across the pure-play opportunities in cannabis, with investments spanning delivery, supply chain logistics, brands, and retail.</p>
<p>But the health benefits that cannabinoids could have for all kinds of ailments open up a much larger market &#8212; as do the broad consumer opportunities should Congress <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx">accede to the wishes of more than 60 percent of the American electorate</a> and legalize recreational cannabis use nationally.</p>
<p>And, as Wadhera told us in July, a Biden administration presents a potentially much more positive regulatory environment for the industry than the previous Trump administration did.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Biden will be very helpful. He has laid out many of the things that he wants, and [while] he isn’t taking it as far as full-scale legalization, he’s certainly in favor of full-scale decriminalization, [meaning] letting states have full authority over what happens with their businesses, and also the rescheduling of cannabis down from the current Schedule 1 level,&#8221; Wadhera had said. &#8220;So all of that will be incredibly helpful and will bring a lot more players who will feel comfortable investing in the space and, potentially, acquiring some of these businesses, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A coalition of companies have filed <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20433333-nso-v-whatsapp-amicus-brief-microsoft-et-al-as-filed">an amicus brief</a> in support of a legal case brought by WhatsApp against Israeli intelligence firm NSO Group, accusing the company of using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones/">an undisclosed vulnerability</a> in the messaging app to hack into at least 1,400 devices, some of which were owned by journalists and human rights activists.</p>
<p>NSO develops and sells governments access to its Pegasus spyware, allowing its nation-state customers to target and stealthily hack into the devices of its targets. Spyware like Pegasus can track a victim&#8217;s location, read their messages and listen to their calls, steal their photos and files and siphon off private information from their device. The spyware is often installed by tricking a target into opening a malicious link, or sometimes by exploiting never-before-seen vulnerabilities in apps or phones to silently infect the victims with the spyware. The company has drawn ire for selling to authoritarian regimes, like Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Last year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> found and patched a vulnerability that it said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones/">was being abused</a> to deliver the government-grade spyware, in some cases without the victim knowing. Months later, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/whatsapp-spyware-nso-group/">WhatsApp sued NSO</a> to understand more about the incident, including which of its government customers was behind the attack.</p>
<p>NSO has repeatedly disputed the allegations, but was unable to convince a U.S. court to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/us-judge-whatsapp-lawsuit-against-israeli-spyware-firm-nso-can-proceed">drop the case</a> earlier this year. NSO&#8217;s main legal defense is that it is afforded legal immunities because it acts on behalf of governments.</p>
<p>But a coalition of tech companies has sided with WhatsApp, and is now asking the court to not allow NSO to claim or be subject to immunity.</p>
<p>Microsoft (including its subsidiaries LinkedIn and GitHub), Google, Cisco, VMware and the Internet Association, which represents dozens of tech giants, including Amazon, Facebook and Twitter, warned that the development of spyware and espionage tools — including hoarding the vulnerabilities used to deliver them — make ordinary people less safe and secure, and also runs the risk of these tools falling into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Microsoft&#8217;s customer security and trust chief Tom Burt said NSO should be accountable for the tools it builds and the vulnerabilities it exploits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Private companies should remain subject to liability when they use their cyber-surveillance tools to break the law, or knowingly permit their use for such purposes, regardless of who their customers are or what they’re trying to achieve,&#8221; said Burt. &#8220;We hope that standing together with our competitors today through this amicus brief will help protect our collective customers and global digital ecosystem from more indiscriminate attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for NSO did not immediately comment.</p>

<p>The $900 billion pandemic relief bill that lawmakers agreed on over the weekend includes a number of provisions that could have a significant impact on the tech industry. For one thing, it commits <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/covid-19-relief-bill-includes-1-9b-to-rip-and-replace-huawei-and-zte-equipment/">$7 billion to increase broadband access</a>, including $50 monthly payments to help qualifying families pay for broadband.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bill also includes $1.9 billion to &#8220;rip and replace&#8221; equipment from Chinese companies ZTE and Huawei. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/new-stimulus-bill-includes-35-2-billion-for-new-energy-initiatives/">there&#8217;s $35.2 billion for energy initiatives</a>, with photovoltaics, new transportation technologies and energy efficiency technologies looking like the big winners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The demise of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> car, the technology giant&#8217;s not-so-secret secret project, was perhaps overstated. Apple&#8217;s so-called Project Titan, which last year reduced the team by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/apple-cuts-200-staff-project-titan/">some 200 employees</a>, is not only alive, it has plans to produce an electric passenger vehicle with &#8220;breakthrough battery technology&#8221; and automated vehicle technology by 2024, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY">report from Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what the vehicle will look like, who will be the manufacturing partner or if the self-driving system that Apple has been working on will be part of the car or offered as a software product to other companies. The Reuters article builds off of another report from Taiwanese media outlet <a href="https://j3onakwrnmmdhlpoecrnirxutq-adwhj77lcyoafdy-money-udn-com.translate.goog/money/story/5612/5108191">Economic Daily Times</a>, which describes Apple ramping up orders for auto parts and components from suppliers in the country. Together, the reports offer confirmation that Apple, while quiet and with a smaller team, hasn&#8217;t ditched the idea of a car after all.</p>
<p>Reuters sources describe this as a passenger vehicle, which would put Apple in a different category than autonomous vehicle technology companies like Waymo that are trying to commercialize robotaxi services. (Waymo has said that it is also interested in licensing its AV tech for passenger vehicles, but it&#8217;s not the company&#8217;s first priority.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The day-to-day operations of Apple&#8217;s Project Titan is led by Doug Field, who returned to the company in 2018 after a stint at electric automaker Tesla. Field, who was senior vice president of engineering at Tesla, was one of the key executives behind the launch of the Model 3. Under Field&#8217;s leadership, it appears the Apple car might square off more directly with Tesla than say Alphabet&#8217;s Waymo.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/apple-shifts-leadership-of-self-driving-car-division-to-ai-chief?sref=ExbtjcSG">Bloomberg reported</a> that Apple has moved Field and the rest of the Project Titan team under Apple executive John Giannandrea&#8217;s artificial intelligence and machine-learning group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here in the final few working days of 2020, a surprising number of new unicorns have come to light. The <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33/status/1340054032899948545">mad scramble</a> that investors are seeing in seed-stage startups appears to be reflected across the later stages as well.</p>
<p>That deal-making is still alive is not a surprise, but the cadence at which the market is crowning new unicorns is slightly startling, given the time of year. I&#8217;ve given up expecting a slowdown in venture capital, but I did anticipate <em>some</em> deceleration in huge rounds and resulting unicorn valuations this close to Christmas.</p>

<hr />
<p>This morning after contrasting a PitchBook-derived $500 million, post-money valuation for Bolt&#8217;s Series C that its CEO had said was roughly doubled in its Series C1, TechCrunch discovered that the online checkout software company likely landed a new valuation right around the unicorn mark. Bolt&#8217;s PR team declined to share a new valuation or grade our math, saying that its framing was &#8220;fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>One new unicorn &#8212; or near-unicorn, perhaps &#8212; was not enough for the day. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mary-meekers-vc-firm-bond-invests-in-ironclad-at-nearly-1-billion-valuation">broke news this afternoon</a> that Ironclad, which sells contract management software, put together a round worth &#8220;at least $100 million,&#8221; valuing the company at &#8220;more than $950 million.&#8221; Akin to Bolt, this unicorn-or-just-under valuation is also a doubling or better from its last private round.</p>
<p>In fact, two new unicorns were insufficient: a <em>third</em> company also made the mark today, namely Qualia, which <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/21/2148941/0/en/Qualia-Becomes-Latest-Tech-Unicorn-with-65m-Series-D-Acquires-Adeptive-Software.html">trumpeted the valuation achievement in a release</a>. Qualia builds real estate software.</p>
<p>Three unicorns in one day is busy. To see three come to light on December 21st is a little bonkers.</p>
<p>And they are hardly the only startups we&#8217;ve seen sprout horns and race about on four legs in recent days. There&#8217;s Boom, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zenoti" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zenoti">Zenoti <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and BigID also in the last week or so. That&#8217;s at least six new unicorns since roughly the mid-point of December. Wild!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the rounds and see what we can learn from them.</p>
<h2>Hello, new unicorns</h2>
<p>Starting with <strong>Bolt</strong>, there are a few lessons for us to take away. First: not every company that secures a unicorn (or a near-unicorn valuation) wants to make noise about it. We&#8217;ve known this, but the company&#8217;s currently coy attitude underscores the point. Second from Bolt is that inside investors are more than willing to crown unicorns in their own portfolio.</p>
<p>According to CEO Ryan Breslow, after his company raised its Series C, the round&#8217;s lead investor offered the company another term sheet. But WestCap was not its only lead. General Atlantic came in as well, giving the $75 million investment two leads. Bolt had already decided to call its new round a Series C1 before General Atlantic entered the deal, the addition of which brought $15 million to what was previously a $60 million investment.</p>
<p>Bolt&#8217;s round fits neatly into a number of trends that we&#8217;ve been watching: inside rounds being bullish not bearish in 2020, the fastest-growing companies raising two rounds this year and the incredible focus by venture investors into startups that were not merely surviving COVID-19, but benefiting from how it shook up the market.</p>
<p>Turning to <strong><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ironclad" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ironclad">Ironclad</strong>, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> around $100 million at around a $950 million valuation is about as basic as a unicorn round can get. And because it has been more than a year since its last round, you might think that there is not that much to learn in its case.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/peloton-interactive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="peloton-interactive">Peloton <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has <a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor">announced</a> that it intends to acquire Precor, one of the world&#8217;s largest suppliers of commercial fitness equipment. You probably recognize the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/precor" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="precor">Precor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> brand name if you&#8217;ve ever spent time in a hotel or standalone commercial gym, which is exactly why Peloton making this purchase makes a ton of sense at this particular time for the hot home-workout brand.</p>
<p>The Precor acquisition will be made via a deal that&#8217;s valued at a total of $420 million, and in addition to expanding its commercial business, this also helps Peloton bring on a lot more manufacturing capability in a time when its order queue for its Tread and Bike hardware is deeper than ever, thanks to the increase in demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Precor already maintains a significant U.S.-based manufacturing operation, as well as dedicated research and development teams and facilities. In total, Peloton says in a press release that it&#8217;ll be adding 625,000 square feet of manufacturing facility in the U.S., between Precor facilities in both Whitsett, North Carolina and Woodinville, Washington.</p>
<p>While the near-term use of the acquisition, which is set to close in 2021 if it meets all approvals, is to speed up delivery times for customers of existing equipment, long-term this deal sets Peloton up nicely for greater commercial market expansion &#8212; once the commercial market returns to growth. While the pandemic has been a clear boon for Peloton&#8217;s at-home equipment and fitness subscription service, it&#8217;s also been devastating for gym chains and hoteliers, meaning that it&#8217;s likely Precor&#8217;s primary business was taking a considerable hit over the past few months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is the largest deal that Peloton has made thus far, but it&#8217;s possible it picked up Precor for a relative bargain; Precor owner Anta Sports was said to have been seeking a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-26/china-s-anta-sports-said-to-weigh-sale-of-fitness-brand-precor?sref=gni836kR">potential sale of the company for around $500 million</a> last November. Peloton will be installing Precor President Rob Barker as GM of Peloton Commercial as part of the new deal, and that should help it accelerate the infiltration of its connected equipment in commercial gyms globally once people feel more comfortable about returning to them safely post-pandemic.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["We don't shy away from taking risks," said Spacefund's Meagan Crawford.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic might have upended the global economy, but according to Meagan Crawford at Spacefund and Chris Moran with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lockheed-martin-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lockheed-martin-ventures">Lockheed Martin Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> it didn&#8217;t dampen investment in space startups.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The space industry has enjoyed a honeymoon period with hundreds of startups popping up in the past five to seven years following SpaceX&#8217;s success.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spacefund research conducted earlier this year found that there is almost no correlation between the global economy and the space industry, said Crawford, a managing partner at the VC firm, last Thursday at TC Sessions: Space 2020. Crawford and Moran both agreed that interest and investment in space will increase as more startups have successful exits.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We looked back historically over the last decade and a little bit more, and it turns out that even during the 2008-2009 economic downturn, the space industry continued to grow at 7% per year,&#8221; Crawford said, adding that they saw almost no correlation between the performance of the Global S&amp;P 1200 and the space industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of this has to do with a big portion of the industry coming from government budgets, which provides a lot of stability even in economically rough times, as well as the industry being in such high demand and going through such a high-growth phase right now that even the pandemic couldn&#8217;t really slow it down,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Early-stage investments did suffer at the beginning of the year, Moran noted after the event, but added that it appeared to be temporary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firms were circling the wagons on their portfolios, in-person incubator programs went on hiatus, so there were fewer early-stage companies out there and less money for those companies,&#8221; he said, adding that Pitchbook data confirmed LMVC&#8217;s suspicions and showed a 25% to 27% drop in new company formation over that time.</p>
<p>Since September, LMVC has seen a spike in new companies. Meanwhile, incubators and accelerators have adapted to COVID-19 restrictions, Zoom made face-to-face meetings easy and life “as usual” started back up again, Moran added.</p>
<h2>Exits are driving investments</h2>
<p>The space industry has enjoyed a honeymoon period with hundreds of startups popping up in the past five to seven years following <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> success. Moran said this unabashed growth period will continue for a few years before narrowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;So like any any industry in VC, you see a lot of people jump in and then as business models collide and the need to generate some sustainable business happens there&#8217;s a lot of winnowing and narrowing of the field,&#8221; Moran said. &#8220;We&#8217;re probably still in that growth period, but I imagine over the next few years, we&#8217;ll start seeing this winnowing and really focus on the folks who have a technology and a business model that will be successful long term.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, the entire industry is funded on private capital, said Moran, who predicted investing is going to grow for some time as long as people see the excitement and promise of the industry. He added that easy access to public markets — notably the rise in mergers with special purpose acquisition companies — could drive even more money into space.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

		A career hacker, David "Moose" Wolpoff is CTO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.randori.com/">Randori</a>, a company building a continuous red-teaming platform.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p dir="ltr">The security industry is reverberating with news of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fireeye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fireeye">FireEye <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> breach and the announcement <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber-amazoncom/exclusive-u-s-treasury-breached-by-hackers-backed-by-foreign-government-sources-idUSL1N2IT0HS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber-amazoncom/exclusive-u-s-treasury-breached-by-hackers-backed-by-foreign-government-sources-idUSL1N2IT0HS&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451597000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7vwCh_QewC2t_DMstGDUePAQDiQ">that the U.S. Treasury Department</a>, DHS and potentially several other government agencies, were hacked due (in part, at least) to a supply chain attack on <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/orion-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.solarwinds.com/orion-platform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451597000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZ_4DyfnEnv9l-MJc9NarrIsejOw">SolarWinds</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These breaches are reminders that nobody is immune to risk or being hacked. I&#8217;ve no doubt that both FireEye and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/solarwinds" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="solarwinds">SolarWinds <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> take security very seriously, but every company is subject to the same reality: Compromise is inevitable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way I judge these events is not by whether someone is hacked, but by how much effort the adversary needed to expend to turn a compromise into a meaningful breach. We’ve heard FireEye put effort and execution into the protection of sensitive tools and accesses, forcing the Russians to put stunning effort into a breach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Run a red-team security program, see how well you stack up and learn from your mistakes.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p dir="ltr">More evidence of FireEye’s dedication to security can be seen by the speed with which its moved to publish <a href="https://github.com/fireeye/red_team_tool_countermeasures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/fireeye/red_team_tool_countermeasures&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451597000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGd-uDIMoafbySphETmapkXnbxToQ">countermeasure tools</a>. While the Solarwinds breach has had stunning immediate fallout, I’ll reserve opining about SolarWinds until we learn details of the whole event, because while a breach that traverses the supply should be exceedingly rare, they’ll never be stopped entirely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All this is to say, this news isn&#8217;t surprising to me. Security organizations are a top adversarial target, and I would expect a nation-state like Russia to go to great lengths to impede FireEye’s ability to protect its customers. FireEye has trusted relationships with many enterprise organizations, which makes it a juicy target for espionage activities. SolarWinds, with its lengthy list of government and large enterprise customers, is a desirable target for an adversary looking to maximize its efforts.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2089913" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089913" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2089913 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0-1.png" alt="SolarWinds' hackers gained access to multiple federal agencies." width="500" height="303" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0-1.png 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089913" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> David Wolpoff</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hack Solarwinds once, and Russia gains access to many of its prized customers. This isn’t the first time a nation-state adversary has gone through the supply chain. Nor is it likely to be the last.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For security leaders, this is a good opportunity to reflect on their reliance and trust in technology solutions. These breaches are reminders of unseen risk debt: Organizations have a huge amount of potential harm built up through their providers that typically isn’t adequately hedged against.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People need to ask the question, &#8220;What happens when my MSSP, security vendor or any tech vendor is compromised?&#8221; Don’t look at the Solarwinds hack in isolation. Look at every one of your vendors that can push updates into your environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No single tool can be relied on to never fail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You need to expect that FireEye, SolarWinds and every other vendor in your environment will eventually get compromised. When failures occur, you need to know: &#8220;Will the remainder of my plans be sufficient, and will my organization be resilient?&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What’s your backup plan when this fails? Will you even know?</p>
<p dir="ltr">If your security program is critically dependent on FireEye (Read: It’s the primary security platform), then your security program is dependent on FireEye implementing, executing and auditing its own program, and you and your management need to be okay with that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Often, organizations purchase a <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9780071771474/sec31_chap11.html#:~:text=Most%20commonly%20these%20functions%20are,traffic%20shaping%2C%20and%20so%20on." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9780071771474/sec31_chap11.html%23:~:text%3DMost%2520commonly%2520these%2520functions%2520are,traffic%2520shaping%252C%2520and%2520so%2520on.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451597000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFpf_vRmRuAZU-xsU1xU8z098TUzg">single security solution</a> to cover multiple functions, like their VPN, firewall, monitoring solution and network segmentation device. But then you have a single point of failure. If the box stops working (or is hacked), everything fails.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From a structural standpoint, it’s hard to have something like SolarWinds be a point of compromise and not have wide-reaching effects. But if you trusted Solarwind’s Orion platform to talk to and integrate with everything in your environment, then you took the risk that a breach like this wouldn’t happen. When I think about utilizing any tool (or service) one question I always ask is, &#8220;When this thing fails, or is hacked, how will I know and what will I do?&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes the answer might be as simple as, &#8220;That’s an insurance-level event,&#8221; but more often I’m thinking about other ways to get some signal to the defenders. In this case, when Solarwinds is the vector, will something else in my stack still give me an indication that my network is spewing traffic to Russia?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Architecting a <a href="https://www.randori.com/build-security-programs-resilient-to-risk-not-the-latest-vulnerability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.randori.com/build-security-programs-resilient-to-risk-not-the-latest-vulnerability/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451598000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEiyxMKF05pAyRbJr5PP2BkNc_VvQ">resilient security program</a> isn’t easy; in fact, it&#8217;s a really hard problem to solve. No product or vendor is perfect, that’s been proven time and again. You need to have controls layered on top of each other. Run through “what happens” scenarios. Organizations focusing on defense in depth, and defending forward, will be in a more resilient position. How many failures does it take for a hacker to get to the goods? It should take more than one mishap for critical data to end up in Russia&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s critical to think in terms of <a href="https://hexadecimoose.medium.com/hackers-arent-magicians-they-just-know-the-right-questions-to-ask-75ea320faf61?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hexadecimoose.medium.com/hackers-arent-magicians-they-just-know-the-right-questions-to-ask-75ea320faf61?source%3Dyour_stories_page-------------------------------------&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451598000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEP-A5c64fpxryWxVsVDqeaH8K5VQ">probability and likelihood</a> and put controls in place to prevent accidental changes to baseline security. Least privilege should be the default, and lots of segmenting should prevent rapid lateral motion. Monitoring and alerting should trigger responses, and if any wild deviations occur, the fail safes should activate. Run a red-team security program, see how well you stack up and learn from your mistakes.</p>
<div>
<p>Much was made of the security impacts of the FireEye breach. In reality, Russia already has tools commensurate to those taken from FireEye. So while pundits might like to make a big story out of the tools themselves, this is not likely to be reminiscent of other leaks, such as those of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eternalblue-leaked-nsa-spy-tool-hacked-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wired.com/story/eternalblue-leaked-nsa-spy-tool-hacked-world/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451598000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGuz-4o1RtzkYeBOaksgwWk9LI7vQ">NSA tools</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>The exploits released from the NSA were remarkable and immediately useful for adversaries to use, and those exploits were responsible for temporarily increased risk the industry experienced after the Shadow Brokers hack  —  it wasn’t the rootkits and malware (which were what was stolen at FireEye). In the FireEye case, since it appears there were no zero-days or exploits taken, I don’t expect that breach to cause significant shockwaves.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Breaches of this magnitude are going to happen. If they’re something your organization needs to be resilient against, then it’s best to be prepared for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever heard someone refer to the idea of &#8220;working in space,&#8221; you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking they were describing a science-fiction plot. But the number of humans actively working beyond Earth&#8217;s atmosphere &#8212; and living significant chunks of their lives there, too &#8212; is about to start growing at a potentially exponential rate. Given how small that population is now, the growth might look slow at first &#8212; but it&#8217;s happening soon, and plans are in place to help it start ramping up quickly.</p>
<p>The main company leading those plans in the near-term is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/axiom-space" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="axiom-space">Axiom Space, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a private space station service provider, and eventual operator. Axiom is founded and led by people with International Space Station experience and expertise, and the company already operates R&amp;D missions on behalf of private clients on the ISS with the help of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> astronauts. It&#8217;s planning to begin shuttling entire flights of private astronauts to the station starting in 2021, and it&#8217;s also building a new, commercial space station to ultimately replace the ISS on orbit once that one is decommissioned.</p>
<p>Axiom Space&#8217;s Chief Business Office Amir Blachman joined us at TC Sessions: Space last week on a panel that included NASA Chief of Exploration and Mission Planning <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Nujoud Merancy</span>, Sierra Nevada Corporation senior vice president and former astronaut Janet Kavandi, as well as Space Exploration Architecture (SEArch+) co-founder Melodie Yashar. The panel was focused on how public and private entities are preparing for a (relatively near) future in which humans spend more time off Earth &#8212; and further away from it, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>
		<div class="embed breakout" id="vidible_div_0" data-pid="56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a" data-bcid="564f313b67b6231408bc51ee" data-video="5fdbca1ef6a45d2d1fc0680f"></div>
		<span><script type="text/javascript" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/themes/techcrunch-2017/features/shortcodes/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0"></script></span>
		</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s now, it&#8217;s been now for a couple years already,&#8221; Blachman said, in response to a question about how far off humans beyond NASA astronauts living in space actually is. &#8220;Axiom, sends crews to the International Space Station today on our own missions, while we&#8217;re building the new commercial space station that will succeed ISS when it&#8217;s decommissioned. Our first mission with a crew of four astronauts launches 12 months from now, and the four crew members have already gone through medical, they&#8217;ve done their suit fittings, we&#8217;ve already integrated our medical operations and training team with our launch provider. We&#8217;ll launch that crew in 2021, another crew in 2022, two crews and 2023, four in 2024 &#8212; and it grows from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Blachman and Merancy talked about the importance of automation and robotic systems on both Axiom&#8217;s future commercial space stations and on NASA&#8217;s future habitats on the lunar surface, and on the lunar Gateway that will remain in orbit around the moon and act as a staging ground for lunar missions.</p>
<p>&#8220;ISS was meant to be tended all the time,&#8221; Merancy said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not meant to be an uncrewed station. And while the flight controllers on the ground do a lot of the actual operation of it, it&#8217;s meant to have people there to perform maintenance. We don&#8217;t have that luxury, when you start talking about the lunar architecture, the Gateway will be tended only when the crew arrives, and the stuff on the surface will be tended only for, you know, a week at first and then longer over time. But you still want to have all of those things be capable of doing useful science or useful exploration even without the crew. So the ability to do tele robotics, maintain things via ground command and things like that so that when the crew arrives, they can just throw the hatch open and get to work would be the ideal state.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working under the assumption that these habitats and critical infrastructure on Mars, and now more recently on the moon should be constructed, and should be thought of as being constructed, as autonomously as possible,&#8221; Yashar added. &#8220;So we typically design for precursor missions, which would happen even before a crew arrives, hoping that almost all of the systems through construction, materials, excavation, materials handling and all of the other systems that we&#8217;ve been looking at would more or less happen as autonomously as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kavandi, too, echoed the sentiments of the others with regards to the degree to which modern human space systems will incorporate automation. I asked whether that would introduce complexity, but she said that rather, it should accomplish the opposite. Somewhat ironically, the path forward for human activity in space actually involves a lot less human activity &#8212; at least when it comes to the business of operating and maintaining in-space infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Advanced technology things can sometimes add simplicity,&#8221; Kavandi said. &#8220;As we&#8217;ve increased our capabilities over the years, with computers, for instance, they&#8217;ve become easier to use, not harder to use. The objective is to try to minimize crew time and crew maintenance so that you can concentrate your time, your time for doing research, or whatever it is that you&#8217;re supposed to do up there, whatever your mission happens to be. So the more we can simplify the interfaces, the more that we can have automation, where the crew only has to intervene when something is going wrong, but generally things go smoothly, and they don&#8217;t have to do anything, that is an ideal situation. And in that case, you have a lot more free time available to then actually do the work that you&#8217;re up there for.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new economic stimulus proposal that has been approved by Congress includes roughly $35.2 billion for energy initiatives, according to summary documents seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This is probably the biggest energy bill we’ve seen in a decade,&#8221; said policy analyst<a href="https://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/people/leah-stokes"> Dr. Leah Stokes</a>, an Assistant Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  </span></p>
<p>The spending is split between the Energy Act of 2020 and the Energy for the Environment Act, and both include new money for big technology initiatives.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;[The Energy Act of 2020] is a bipartisan, bicameral energy innovation package that authorizes over $35 billion in RD&amp;D activities across DOE&#8217;s portfolio and strengthens or creates programs crucial to advancing new technologies into the market,&#8221; a summary document for the legislation reads.</p>
<p>Included in the spending package is more than $4.1 billion for new technology initiatives.</p>
<p>The biggest winners are photovoltaics, new transportation technologies and energy-efficiency technologies.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;ll break down key provisions in this THREAD&#8230;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/BT0i5QKKkF">pic.twitter.com/BT0i5QKKkF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Dr. Leah Stokes (@leahstokes) <a href="https://twitter.com/leahstokes/status/1341104236856107008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There&#8217;s <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$1.5 billion for new solar technologies including modules, concentrating solar technology, new photovoltaic technologies and initiatives to expand solar manufacturing and recycling technologies. And $2.6 billion set aside for transportation technologies. Finally, energy-efficiency and weatherization programs are continuing to be supported through a $1.7 billion reauthorization of the Weatherization Assistance Program. </span></p>
<p>Energy-grid technologies get a $3.44 billion boost through $1.08 billion in support for short-term, long-term, seasonal and transportation energy storage technologies and $2.36 billion for smart utility and energy distribution technologies. <i></i></p>
<p>Another $625 million is dedicated to new research, development and commercialization for both onshore and offshore wind technologies. And $850 million is being set aside for geothermal technology development and $933 million for marine energy and hydropower tech. Finally, there&#8217;s $160 million earmarked for hydropower generator upgrades, and <span style="font-weight: 400;">upgrades to existing federal infrastructure through $180 million earmarked to the Federal Energy Management Program. </span></p>
<p>In an attempt to ensure that the money and innovation is used in the industries where decarbonization is the most technically challenging, there&#8217;s a $500 million pot for stakeholders in industries like iron, steel, aluminum, cement and chemicals as well as transportation businesses like shipping, aviation and long-distance transport that are looking to decarbonize.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By making these critical investments now, the Energy Act of 2020 will help &#8220;reduce our nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, bring good-paying jobs back to the United States, and allow us to export these technologies to growing markets abroad for years to come,&#8221; the summary report reads. </span></p>
<p>If the next generation of technologies that already have broad commercial support is one area getting a boost, then another big pool of money is going to support the commercialization of technologies whose viability has yet to be demonstrated at commercial scale.</p>
<p>These include carbon capture utilization and storage technologies that are getting a $6.2 billion boost for roll out at industrial and energy sites. Congress is also approving a $447 million research and development program for large-scale commercial carbon dioxide removal projects &#8212; with a $100 million carve out grant for direct air capture competition at facilities that capture at least 50,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually.</p>
<p>Nuclear technologies are also getting their day in the sun thanks to $6.6 billion in funding for the modernization of existing nuclear power plants and the development of advanced reactors. And, the nascent fusion industry can add another $4.7 billion to their calculus for available capital thanks to a carve out for basic and applied research investments.</p>
<p>All of this spending also comes with money to ensure that emerging technologies aren&#8217;t left out. There&#8217;s a $2.9 billion allocation to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arpa-e" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arpa-e">ARPA-E, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the energy advanced research arm of the government whose structure is similar to the DARPA program that was responsible for the development of the internet. And, taking a page from the NASA playbook that commercialized a number of technologies, the Office of Technology Transitions, which promotes national lab partnerships, is being codified and supporting the kind of milestone-based projects that have been effectively used by the Air Force and the Department of Defense broadly.</p>
<p>To cap it off, the new energy bill includes a directive to the Department of the Interior to target the generation of 25 gigawatts of solar, wind and geothermal production on public lands by 2025.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My understanding of it is that they’re trying to look at what the federal government has done for solar and wind and see how we can do that for other technologies,&#8221; Stokes said. </span></p>
<p>For her, what&#8217;s in other portions of the stimulus are equally important from a climate perspective. There&#8217;s a commitment to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a huge contributor to global warming and climate change by 2035. Phasing out the use of these chemicals globally in refrigeration and other applications could reduce warming by half a degree centigrade (which is a big deal).</p>
<p>Stokes took issue with the duration of some of the tax credits, whose extensions were relatively short, and the absence of a tax credit for electric vehicles. &#8220;The tax credits for EVs are a consumer-facing benefit that are absolutely critical to adoption,&#8221; Stokes said. &#8220;That was a massive equalizer between EVs and combustion engine cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>For all of the good news for climate activists baked into this portion of the stimulus, Stokes warns that no one concerned about global climate change should break out the bubbly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This package is not going to solve the climate crisis full-stop,&#8221; Stokes said. &#8220;Next year if the Republicans are in control there’s going to be a new chairman and he’s not going to be as generous&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to learn to celebrate the wins and give credit but recognize what’s missing. Which is a lot.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is rolling out new features to its developer community with an update to its recently rebuilt Twitter API. One addition to the now expanded collection of API v2 endpoints will allow app developers to eventually better support Twitter&#8217;s newer conversation controls &#8212; the feature that allows users to specify who can reply to their tweets. Other endpoints allow developers to track tweets by particular accounts, those mentioning a certain account, or retrieve a list of accounts who follow a particular user.</p>
<p>The new endpoints are a continuation of Twitter&#8217;s work on <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2020/introducing_new_twitter_api.html">version 2 of its developer API</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/"> first introduced this June</a>. The API was rebuilt for the first time since 2012 with a goal of including features that had been missing from the earlier version, like polls, pinned tweets and spam filtering, for example, while also rolling out improvements to areas like search and stream filtering.</p>
<p>But Twitter&#8217;s API continues to be a work in progress, as Twitter adds endpoints and further fleshes out its tiered access plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1ADBwO3Dso"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/">Twitter introduces a new, fully rebuilt developer API, launching next week</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter introduces a new, fully rebuilt developer API, launching next week&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/embed/#?secret=1ADBwO3Dso" data-secret="1ADBwO3Dso" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In this release, Twitter is adding some <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/conversation-reply-settings-tweet-field/147169">support for the conversation settings</a> introduced <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/new-conversation-settings-coming-to-a-tweet-near-you.html">earlier this year</a>. This feature allows users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/">choose who can respond</a> to their tweets. On Twitter, users can opt to allow everyone to reply, or they can limit replies only to those they follow or even just the people mentioned in the tweet. These conversation controls are now partially supported in the new API as well, through a field in the Tweet object called reply_settings. The addition will allow developers to tell if the conversation reply settings have been set for a tweet, and if so, who can reply. However, Twitter has not yet writen support for these fields, which Twitter says is coming &#8220;in the future.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MHx7Lco0RS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/">Twitter now lets everyone limit replies to their tweets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter now lets everyone limit replies to their tweets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/embed/#?secret=MHx7Lco0RS" data-secret="MHx7Lco0RS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Eventually, a feature like this may allow third-party apps to better mimic the first-party experience on Twitter.com and in Twitter&#8217;s own native apps. It could also help developers build out social listening apps that only pull in those tweets a social media manager is able to reply to, noted SocialOpinions developer Jamie Maguire, in a Twitter post. Twitter also suggests it could be useful for researchers looking to learn more about the public conversation.</p>
<p>The feature is fully rolled out to v2, Twitter says.</p>
<p>Another set of endpoints, <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/user-tweet-timeline-and-user-mention-timeline-endpoints-available-for-early-access-in-the-twitter-api-v2/147115">user tweet timeline and user mention timelines</a>, return a collection of tweets either composed by or those mentioning a specific Twitter user. Now, these endpoints can also specify the start_time and end_time parameters, meaning they can be used to collect tweets during a certain window of time. The &#8220;user mention timeline&#8221; endpoint also now supports application-only authentication, which Twitter says will make it easier for developers or researchers analyzing a given account.</p>
<p>The company notes these had been two of the most heavily used endpoints in the first version of the API, as they allow for tools in areas like customer support, brand analysis and those that measure a Twitter user&#8217;s sentiment over time.</p>
<p>At launch, developers can request up to 100 tweets per request. The user tweet timeline endpoint is limited to the 3,200 most recent tweets, and the user mention timeline is limited to the 800 most recent tweets. Both will count toward the monthly tweet <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects/overview">cap</a> on Standard Basic access, which is 500,000. This limit is not permanent &#8212; Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/community/2020/future-of-twitter-developer-platform.html">has said before</a> it plans to offer Elevated access to the Twitter API v2 in the Standard product track sometime next year, and businesses can sign up for that free beta <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/business/business-beta">here</a>.</p>
<p>These are available in Early Access to the Twitter API v2.</p>
<p>Twitter also this week launched <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/introducing-the-v2-follow-lookup-endpoints/147118">two new follows lookup endpoints</a>, also in Early Access, that allow developers to retrieve a list of accounts who follow a particular person, or pull the list of accounts that someone follows. These are often used by developers who want to understand how accounts on Twitter are linked for the purpose of network analysis or in the examination of the spread of information or misinformation.</p>

<p>Parts of this will support audience intelligence capabilities and let me surface follower interests, product and brand affinity. <a href="https://t.co/2VWC23Jz1Y">pic.twitter.com/2VWC23Jz1Y</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Developers had told Twitter they wanted to be able to pull rich information about an account&#8217;s relationships without having to make additional calls to look up that account data. These endpoints allow developers to pull the profile information about an account&#8217;s follows in just one request, instead of numerous calls using prior versions of the Twitter API.</p>
<p>These endpoints are often used alongside the endpoints that allow you to follow and unfollow accounts, as well as block and mute accounts. However, that functionality is not yet available.</p>
<p>Twitter committed to more transparency around its API changes and updates this time, but developers may still be wary of building on the platform because of Twitter&#8217;s history. The company in past years repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/twitter-api-client-apps/?_ga=2.28353205.886042617.1594643608-1783005191.1582664406">pulled the rug out from developers</a> building Twitter apps, even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/11/twitter-cuts-off-datasift-to-step-up-its-own-b2b-big-data-analytics-business/?_ga=2.165481334.874764968.1560172608-65650910.1541640065">cutting off access to partners</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/11/13250450/twitter-flight-developer-conference-2016">canceling</a> its developer conference. These moves aren&#8217;t easily forgotten.</p>
<p>Twitter had announced the API changes through <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev">tweets</a> and <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/c/announcements/22">forum posts</a> late last week. The company&#8217;s longer-term developer platform road map is also available publicly <a href="https://trello.com/b/myf7rKwV/twitter-developer-platform-roadmap">here</a>.</p>
